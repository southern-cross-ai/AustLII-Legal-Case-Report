He says it should be set aside and an order made for the reinstatement of proceeding TAD 19 of 2003; see O 35 r 7(2) of the rules of Court. The motion was filed in TAD 19 of 2003. It may, more appropriately, have constituted a separate proceeding; although nothing material turns on this. See Pembroke School Incorporated v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission [2002] FCA 1020 at [22] per Mansfield J.\\n\\nMr Wharton submits that there is new evidence available which leads to the conclusion that the respondents perverted the course of justice. The new evidence is said to be that contained in a statutory declaration of a \\\"key witness\\\". Mr Wharton says that the new evidence shows that the respondents misled and deceived the witness in order to harm Mr Wharton's legal rights. Mr Wharton also says that the new evidence shows that the respondents turned the witness hostile against Mr Wharton.\\n\\nThe relevant witness is Mrs Barbara Adams. In his substantive application, the subject of the consent order, Mr Wharton asserted that the respondents had taken his work in respect of a tourism proposal and had announced a proposal from Mrs Adams bearing a striking similarity to his proposal. In a statement filed in support of his original application, Mr Wharton said that he had met with Mrs Adams who told him, and others, that she had been approached by the respondents concerning the project. The inescapable inference from that statement is that Mr Wharton suspected strongly that Mrs Adams did not have her own plans for a tourism development but was being used by the respondents.\",\"1\":\"This raises the issue of the difficulty in setting aside an order obtained by consent. There is no considered judgment of the Court to use as a yardstick to assist in determining what might have occurred; see SZCZF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 208, where Flick J discussed other difficulties in setting aside a consent order.\\n\\nThere is also the difficulty of the delay between the consent order in 2005 and this application some four years later. The reason for the delay is not satisfactorily explained by Mr Wharton. The evidence which is said to be new could have been adduced with appropriate questioning and the exercise of reasonable diligence by him at the trial.\\n\\nFor the foregoing reasons the applicant's motion is dismissed with costs, to be agreed or taxed in default of agreement.\\n I certify that the preceding thirteen (13) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Marshall. \\n \\n Associate:\\n \\n \\nDated: 28 July 2009\\n \\n The Applicant represented himself. \\n \\n Counsel for the Respondents: Mr M O'Farrell SC \\n \\n Solicitor for the Respondents: James Crotty Barristers & Solicitors \\n Date of Hearing: 27 July 2009 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 27 July 2009 \\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2009\\/791.html\"}}"
