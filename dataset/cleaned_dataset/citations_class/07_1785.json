I do not consider that Mr Fisher's own conduct has been demonstrated to be so unreasonable, or even that if the application against Saxbys was obviously without merit, that a costs order against Mr Fisher would be appropriate. I appreciate that Mr Fisher (as the director of APM) was granted leave to appeal the decision of Registrar Musset, but the hearing was to be treated de novo to consider the solvency of APM.\"}}"
