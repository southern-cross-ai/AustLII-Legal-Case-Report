"{\"id\":{\"0\":\"c0\"},\"class\":{\"0\":\"related\"},\"tocase\":{\"0\":\"Vatera Pty Limited v Meribal Interiors NSW Pty Limited (Under Deed of Company Arrangement); in the Matter of Meribal Interiors NSW Pty Limited (Under Deed of Company Arrangement) [2008] FCA 404\"},\"text\":{\"0\":\"1 On 1 April 2008 I delivered reasons for judgment in this matter ( Vatera Pty Limited v Meribal Interiors NSW Pty Limited (Under Deed of Company Arrangement); in the Matter of Meribal Interiors NSW Pty Limited (Under Deed of Company Arrangement) [2008] FCA 404) and stood the matter over in order to consider the orders to be made. This judgment should be read with those reasons.\\n\\n2 I am satisfied that Mr John Lord is appropriate for appointment as liquidator of the first defendant, Meribal Interiors NSW Pty Limited. He is a recognised liquidator and he has confirmed that he has had no dealings with the plaintiff, Vatera Pty Limited. There is no reason to believe that he will not do his duty as a liquidator of this company and deal with Vatera completely at arm's length.\\n\\n3 As far as draft order 3 is concerned, it is clear that some such arrangement is necessary, as between the liquidator and the administrator. It is not clear to me that it is necessary that it be by way of order. It may be that the statute will simply operate. However, I can see no disadvantage in making the order which is by way of being ancillary to the other orders. I would only make it, however, on the rider, which is incorporated in the latest version, that the fees involved are only those incurred pursuant to the Deed of Company Arrangement (DOCA). I would not, at the moment, say anything about the costs of the administration; that is a topic best left for consideration by the liquidator.\"}}"
