Two Eritrean nationals arrived in Australia and applied for protection visas. A delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs refused their applications. They applied to the Refugee Review Tribunal for reviews of those decisions. The Department received a letter from a third party (who gave his name and address) which made allegations against the male applicant. The author of the letter asked that the information be kept secret. The Department sent the letter to the Tribunal. The Tribunal dismissed the applications for review and affirmed the delegate's decisions. It did not tell the applicants of the letter or of the allegations made in it. The Tribunal said that it placed no weight on the information contained in the letter. The Tribunal considered that it was in the public interest that the matter be regarded as non-disclosable information for the purpose of s 424A(3)(c) of the Act , and made a direction under s 440(1) of the Act that the content of the letter not be published or disclosed.\\n\\n58 The decision in VEAL suggests that in this case the Minister was obliged to disclose to the applicant the substance of the information in the Parole Board reports. The Minister sought to meet the difficulty caused by the fact that he had not done so by submitting that the obligation did not arise in this case because the information in the Parole Board reports was either information from the applicant, or was information which was not adverse to the applicant or was information he already had from other sources.

The Tribunal was not required to give the applicants a copy of the letter or provide any information which would have identified the author of the letter (at [7]). The Court referred to certain statutory provisions, but said that in the circumstances the case was to be decided by reference to the common law principles of procedural fairness. The Court referred to the reasons for judgment of Brennan J in Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550 at 628-629. The Court concluded that the Tribunal had an obligation to draw the applicants' attention to the information in the letter. The Court then said (at 98 [22]-[23]):\\n \\n \\\"The fact that the author of the letter asked the Department to keep it secret did not mean that equitable principles about confidential information were to be engaged in deciding what course the Tribunal took. Rather, the nature and extent of the Tribunal's obligation to disclose the information were regulated by the Act and the obligation to accord the appellant procedural fairness.\\n \\n In this case, the particular content of the obligation to accord procedural fairness was to be identified having regard not only to the particular provisions of the Act that regulated the Tribunal's work but also to the scope and objects of the Act as a whole. In that latter regard, it is necessary to keep two propositions at the forefront of consideration. First, the Act required that those entitled to a particular visa be granted the visa they sought, and that those not entitled be refused. Secondly, the Act committed the decision to grant or refuse a visa to the Executive government and the Tribunal was likewise exercising executive power, not judicial power.\\\"\\n\\n57 The Court said that there was a public interest in the Executive government, when making its decision, not being denied information that has been or may later be supplied by an informer (at 98 [24]). That public interest and the rules of procedural fairness could be accommodated by a requirement that the applicant be advised of substance of the allegations and asking him to respond to those allegations (at 100 [29]). The Court concluded that the Tribunal had not complied with the rules of procedural fairness.\\n\\n58 The decision in VEAL suggests that in this case the Minister was obliged to disclose to the applicant the substance of the information in the Parole Board reports. The Minister sought to meet the difficulty caused by the fact that he had not done so by submitting that the obligation did not arise in this case because the information in the Parole Board reports was either information from the applicant, or was information which was not adverse to the applicant or was information he already had from other sources. The other sources identified by the applicant were a report of Mr Sowerbutts dated 29 August 2006 and Ms Beevor's report. A decision-maker's obligation of disclosure where the common law rules of procedural fairness apply has been discussed in a number of cases. I need go no further than refer to the two well-known decisions of Kioa v West (supra) at 628-629 per Brennan J; Commissioner for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd (1994) 49 FCR 576 at 588-592.\\n\\n59 In this case the Minister presented a schedule of the information in the Parole Board reports and of where he said it either came from the applicant, or was not adverse or was known to the applicant from other sources. The Minister did not submit that there was not information in the Parole Board reports which was \\\"credible, relevant and significant to the decision to be made\\\" ( Kioa v West (supra) at 629 per Brennan J). There are obvious difficulties with the Minister's submission. For example, unless the same words are used, it will sometimes be difficult to determine if the information provided by the applicant or said to have been available from another source is actually the same information which the applicant claims ought to have been disclosed.\\n\\n60 In this case, there clearly was information in the Parole Board reports which was adverse and was not provided by the applicant or to him from other sources. That information related to concerns about where the applicant proposed to live in relation to his victim. The substance of that information should have been disclosed to the applicant. The applicant now has the Parole Board reports and it is not necessary for me to go further and express a conclusion in relation to each piece of information in the Parole Board reports.\\n\\n61 The applicant has established a breach of the rules of procedural fairness.\\n\\n62 The applicant submitted that by reason of the decision-maker's conduct he was denied the opportunity to put his case and has been denied procedural fairness. Of course, the Minister and the officers of his Department did not prevent the applicant from putting forward whatever information he considered appropriate; in fact, he was encouraged by an officer of the Minister's Department to put his best foot forward. However, his case is that by reason of a representation made to him he did not put forward all the information he would otherwise put forward.\\n\\n63 Two decisions of the High Court have dealt with the question of whether there had been a breach of the rules of procedural fairness in circumstances where an applicant, as a result of something said by the decision-maker, did not present to the decision-maker all of the evidence and submissions he would otherwise have presented.\",\"4\":\"13 A person who is facing the cancellation of his or her visa under s 501(2) must be accorded procedural fairness: Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; Ex parte Lam [2003] HCA 6 ; (2003) 214 CLR 1; Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Ex parte Palme [2003] HCA 56 ; (2003) 216 CLR 212.\",\"5\":\"13 A person who is facing the cancellation of his or her visa under s 501(2) must be accorded procedural fairness: Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; Ex parte Lam [2003] HCA 6 ; (2003) 214 CLR 1; Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Ex parte Palme [2003] HCA 56 ; (2003) 216 CLR 212.\",\"6\":\"65 In Muin v Refugee Review Tribunal [2002] HCA 30 ; (2002) 76 ALJR 966 (\\\" Muin \\\"), a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs refused to grant applications by two applicants for protection visas. Both applicants sought review by the Refugee Review Tribunal. Of present relevance is one aspect of the case. The applicants were led to believe that the Tribunal had certain documents called Part B documents which had been before the delegate. That belief was in each case brought about by conduct by the Tribunal.\\n\\n66 A majority of the Court found that in each case there had been a failure to accord procedural fairness in relation to the Part B documents. Gaudron J said that there was a breach of the rules of procedural fairness because a reasonable person in the applicant's position would have considered it unnecessary to direct the Tribunal's attention to material favouring them in the Part B documents by reason of the Tribunal's conduct, that they refrained from doing so and the Tribunal did not have regard to the documents (at 979-980, [62]-[68]). Hayne J, after noting that a number of what would have otherwise been difficult factual matters had been agreed between the parties, said (at 1009 [256]-[257]):\\n \\n \\\"The consequence of what has been agreed between the parties to each of the present actions is that each plaintiff was led to believe, by what the tribunal said, that it had material relevant to that plaintiff's claim which it did not.\\n \\n The agreed facts are silent about whether the tribunal was aware of the information and opinions contained in the Part B documents. It may have been, but more importantly, it may not. It follows, therefore, that in each case, the plaintiff was denied procedural fairness. Neither plaintiff was given an opportunity to place before the tribunal the material and submissions which, on the agreed facts, it is accepted that he or she would have submitted if not mistaken about what was before the tribunal. Moreover, it also follows from the parties' agreement that each plaintiff would have made further submissions and sought to adduce further evidence that the tribunal did not comply with the statutory provisions governing its conduct of the reviews of the plaintiffs' cases.\\\"\\n\\n67 With respect to this last observation by Hayne J, I note that in this case I am not concerned with possible breaches of statutory provisions but, rather, only with the common law requirements. Gummow J (at 996 [171]) and Kirby J (at 999 [194]) agreed with Hayne J's reasoning on this point.\\n\\n68 This case is similar to Aala and Muin in that an applicant would have conducted his case differently in the sense that he would have presented more information, which cannot be said to be irrelevant, but for the conduct of, or representation by, the decision-maker. Where it differs is at a factual level in that in this type of case it will often be difficult to prove as a matter of fact that the applicant would have conducted his case differently. However, I am satisfied of that fact in the particular circumstances of this case and therefore the applicant has established a breach of the rules of procedural fairness on this ground.\",\"7\":\"64 In Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex parte Aala [2000] HCA 57 ; (2000) 204 CLR 82 (\\\" Aala \\\") an applicant who claimed he was a refugee and therefore entitled to a protection visa was told by the Refugee Review Tribunal that it had read all the papers from previous applications and Federal Court proceedings. Relying on that statement the applicant gave no further evidence. The Tribunal rejected the application for review on the basis of a finding that the applicant's claim for refugee status was concocted. In fact, the Tribunal did not have certain unsworn statements by the applicant dealing with those matters and which had been submitted to the Federal Court. The High Court held that the Tribunal had acted in breach of the rules of natural justice and constitutional writs were issued. Each member of the Court was of the view that the Tribunal had misled, albeit innocently, the applicant and that that had caused him to conduct his case in a different way from how he would otherwise have conducted his case. In other words, it was concluded that had the applicant known the correct position he would have put additional material before the Tribunal: Gleeson CJ at 88-89 [3]-[4], Gaudron and Gummow JJ at 113-114 [70], McHugh J at 122 [103], Kirby J at 130 [128], Callinan J at 152-153 [206]-[209], [211]. It is not necessary to refer to the Court's discussion of the submission made in that case that relief should be refused because the presentation of additional material would have made no difference to the result.\\n\\n68 This case is similar to Aala and Muin in that an applicant would have conducted his case differently in the sense that he would have presented more information, which cannot be said to be irrelevant, but for the conduct of, or representation by, the decision-maker. Where it differs is at a factual level in that in this type of case it will often be difficult to prove as a matter of fact that the applicant would have conducted his case differently.
