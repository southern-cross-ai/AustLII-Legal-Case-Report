Nevertheless, the evidence of Global's reputation in the name RBK was quite scant. It consisted of seven sources.\",\"1\":\"136 It follows that I would need to be satisfied to a reasonably high standard that the acronym has acquired a secondary meaning amongst orthopaedic surgeons who carry out total knee replacements; Guide Dogs Owners' & Friends' Association Inc v Guide Dog Association of NSW and ACT (1998) 42 IPR 481 at 502. The acronym would need to be close to a household word for the product amongst those surgeons; British Sugar PLC v James Robertson & Sons Limited [1996] RPC 281 at 306.\\n\\n137 I have already found that the evidence does not satisfy me that the RBK acronym has become so closely associated with Global's RBK as to be distinctive of that prosthesis. The same finding disposes of the claim that RBK has acquired a secondary meaning.\\n\\n138 Global's submission that no other prosthetic knee was referred to in Australia by the name RBK does not advance its case. Nor does the dearth of references to that acronym in the literature or on the worldwide web.\",\"2\":\"142 Also, whether or not the impugned conduct constitutes misleading or deceptive conduct is a question of fact to be determined objectively in the light of all the surrounding circumstances; Taco Company of Australia Inc v Taco Bell Pty Limited (1982) 42 ALR 177 at 202; Puxu at 199, 210-211; Nike at [100]; Butcher v Lachlan Elder Realty Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 60 ; (2005) 212 ALR 357 at [39] .\",\"3\":\"15 The question of whether the conduct of Orthotech and Exactech is misleading or deceptive, or likely to be so, must be determined by reference to the class of prospective purchasers of the Optetrak RBK; Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 44 ; (1982) 149 CLR 191 at 199; Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited [2000] HCA 12 ; (2000) 202 CLR 45 at 85, at [102] [103].\\n\\n141 All that needs to be reiterated before turning to the question which arises is the principle that the conduct must be determined by reference to its effect on the hypothetical ordinary or reasonable member of the class; Puxu at 199, 210-211; Nike at [102] [103].\\n\\n142 Also, whether or not the impugned conduct constitutes misleading or deceptive conduct is a question of fact to be determined objectively in the light of all the surrounding circumstances; Taco Company of Australia Inc v Taco Bell Pty Limited (1982) 42 ALR 177 at 202; Puxu at 199, 210-211; Nike at [100]; Butcher v Lachlan Elder Realty Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 60 ; (2005) 212 ALR 357 at [39] .\\n\\n145 However, there are two short answers to this submission. First, the hypothetical reasonable purchaser is a sophisticated and experienced medical practitioner. Second, the checks and balances in the process of ordering and implanting the prosthesis are sufficient to dispel anything more than a fanciful possibility that the purchaser will be misled; cf Nike at [105].\\n\\n146 There was no dispute about the first of these propositions. The second was supported by a body of uncontroversial evidence. The evidence as to the checks and balances may be summarised as follows.\\n\\n147 First, it is plain that the suppliers of knee prostheses market their products to the surgeons who implant prosthetic knees. They do so in face to face meetings so that, as a consequence, the suppliers' representatives develop a personal relationship with the surgeons.\",\"4\":\"7 However, even if the acronym RBK is descriptive, its use by another trader may, upon a consideration of all the circumstances, amount to misleading conduct if the acronym has acquired a secondary meaning so as to be distinctive of Global's product; Equity Access Pty Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation (1989) 16 IPR 431 at 447.\\n\\n8 Importantly, Global accepts that whether or not RBK is descriptive, it cannot succeed in these proceedings unless it establishes that the acronym RBK is distinctive of its product. That is the essential issue in these proceedings.\\n\\n9 In Equity Access , Hill J said at 448 that the distinction between descriptive and fancy names is not black and white; rather, there is a continuum. Thus, if the name RBK is closer along the continuum toward descriptive names, the heavier the onus will be upon Global to establish a secondary meaning. Also, small differences in other names will usually be adequate to avoid confusion; Hornsby Building at 229; Equity Access at 448.\\n\\n135 Moreover, it seems to me that the acronym RBK, as used in the target market of orthopaedic surgeons, is, at very least a long way toward the descriptive end of the continuum to which Hill J referred in Equity Access. I make that finding based upon the practice of using acronyms in the medical profession and upon the basis of the evidence of Drs Morris, Caldwell and Morgan as to their recognition of the RBK label.\\n\\n159 At most, the position seems to me to be analogous to that which was described as temporary and commercially irrelevant confusion by Lockhart J in Lumley Life Limited v 1OOF of Victoria Friendly Society (1989) 16 IPR 316 at 323-324. This does not constitute misleading conduct; see also Equity Access at 449.\",\"5\":\"\",\"6\":\"6 It is well established that, ordinarily, the use of a descriptive trade name ensures that it is not distinctive of a business and that its application to other like businesses will not ordinarily mislead the public; Hornsby Building Information Centre Pty Limited v Sydney Building Information Centre Limited [1978] HCA 11 ; (1978) 140 CLR 216 at 229.\\n\\n9 In Equity Access , Hill J said at 448 that the distinction between descriptive and fancy names is not black and white; rather, there is a continuum.

The nature of the market and the way in which prosthetic knees are ordered and implanted require close consideration. This is because the whole of the circumstances must be looked at in order to determine whether the impugned conduct is misleading or deceptive; Puxu at 199.\\n\\n17 Mr Michael Ribot has had a long history of involvement in the distribution of orthopaedic products.

The considerations to which Dr Breit referred in the passage set out at [99] above, demonstrates the close involvement of the surgeon in the decision making process.\\n\\n150 Fourth, surgeons tend to have a preferred brand of prosthesis.
