The statements of principle in the Canaero decision were set out in the judgment of Laskin J at 382, as follows:\\n In my opinion, this ethic disqualifies a director or senior officer from usurping for himself or diverting to another person or company with whom or with which he is associated a maturing business opportunity which his company is actively pursuing; he is also precluded from so acting even after his resignation where the resignation may fairly be said to have been prompted or influenced by a wish to acquire for himself the opportunity sought by the company, or where it was his position with the company rather than a fresh initiative that lead him to the opportunity which he later acquired.\",\"1\":\"6 The principles upon which the applicants rely are not in dispute.

However, three matters were raised by Mr Greenwood SC who appeared for Mr Uhlen, and I will address Mr Greenwood's points.\\n\\n9 First Mr Greenwood cross-examined Mr Wolfe, the Managing Director of Tennant, to suggest that the applicants would not be able to meet their undertakings as to damages. Mr Wolfe's evidence on this issue was not entirely satisfactory. It is true that he was given no advance warning, but I would have expected him to have a better knowledge of the financial position of the company than he revealed this morning. Nevertheless, I am satisfied on the basis of Mr Wolfe's evidence that the applicants are in a position to meet the undertaking.\"}}"
