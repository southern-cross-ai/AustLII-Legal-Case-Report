The first is the viability of the applicant's claim to relief under s 52 of the Trade Practices Act . The second is whether the applicant has standing to claim relief under the ADJR Act, s 192 of the Patents Act and s 39B of the Judiciary Act . The third is whether, assuming it has standing, it should be denied relief because of its delay. In a s 31A context, in each case the question is whether the Court is satisfied that there is no reasonable prospect of the applicant succeeding in the relevant claim or issue.\\n\\n11 The applicant alleges that in applying for an extension of the term of the Patent, Lilly represented to the first respondent (the Commissioner) that the pharmaceutical substance on the ARTG on which it relied was disclosed in claims 1 to 4 and 6 of the Patent. The applicant alleges that these representations were made in trade and commerce and were false.\",\"1\":\"12 In Glueck v Stang (2008) 76 IPR 75 the applicant alleged that Novopharm, in trade or commerce, engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct in relation to an application to the Australian Patent Office for the grant of letters patent. At [32] to [33] Lindgren J said:\\n The course of authority outlined above requires me to hold that the alleged representations by Novopharm to the APO ... were not made in trade or commerce. They were not made in the course of a trading or commercial relationship between Novopharm on the one hand, and ... the APO ... on the other hand. Novopharm had no trading or commercial dealings with the APO .... Nor were they made in the course of the negotiation of contracts .... The alleged representations were made to a government instrumentality pursuant to legislation for the purpose of obtaining an exclusive right or bundle of rights made available by that legislation. No doubt the alleged representations were made by Novopharm in trade or commerce in a broad non-s 52 sense. However, in Concrete Constructions the High Court ... rejected the view that the expression 'in trade or commerce' in s 52 referred to the 'immense field of activities' in which corporations may engage in the course of, or for the purposes of, carrying on some overall trading or commercial business ....\\n\\n14 The applicant sought to distinguish the present case from Glueck on the ground that the facts of the two cases were different. That is true, but the proposition derived by Lindgren J from the authorities referred to is applicable here. Essentially that is because of the passage in Concrete Constructions at 604, upon which Glueck was based, in which it was said:\\n What the section is concerned with is the conduct of a corporation towards persons, be they consumers or not, with whom it ... has or may have dealings in the course of those activities or transactions which, of their nature, bear a trading or commercial character. \\nIt is that relationship that is absent here.

Adapted to the present case, the question is whether there is a reasonable possibility that the applicant would be disadvantaged in the sense that it would be prevented from exploiting the invention in any of the respects falling within the definition of \\\"exploit\\\" in the Patents Act . That includes a number of things preparatory to placing a product in the marketplace. Matters falling within the concept of \\\"launching\\\" a product include importing, keeping for the purpose of offering for sale, and using. In my view the fair reading of par 49 of Mr Gray's affidavit is that propounded by the applicant. Nor do I think the use of the word \\\"marketing\\\" in par 26 of that affidavit bears the emphasis Lilly places on it. All Mr Gray is saying is that in order successfully to sell a product, that is to say make money out of it, PBS listing is essential. As appears from [19] and [21], the applicant has pleaded only that it has not yet obtained TGA approval, believes it will obtain it in late 2008 or early 2009, and will not import and sell the product until it receives TGA registration. It does not plead PBS listing as a precondition. The Assa Abloy test speaks of the existence of a reasonable possibility of disadvantage. For the purposes of a s 31A application, I am not satisfied that that possibility does not exist. I am not persuaded that the applicant has no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the ADJR, s 192 and s 39A parts of the proceeding by reason of a lack of standing.\\n\\n28 Section 11(1)(c) of the ADJR Act provides that an application for an order of review in relation to a written decision \\\"that was furnished to the applicant\\\" must be lodged within the prescribed period or within such further time as the court allows. Under sub-s (3) the prescribed period is the period commencing on the day on which the decision is made and ending on the 28 th day after the decision is \\\"furnished to the applicant\\\". Subsection (4) provides that where no period is prescribed, the court may refuse to entertain an application if of the opinion that the application was not made within a reasonable time after the decision was made. In forming an opinion for the purposes of subs (4), the court is to have regard to the time at which the applicant became aware of the making of the decision: subs (5)(a).\",\"6\":\"18 In Assa Abloy Australia Pty Ltd v Australian Lock Co Pty Ltd [2005] FCAFC 246 ; (2005) 68 IPR 105 at [19] the Full Court referred to the observations of McLelland J in a trade mark context in Ritz Hotel Ltd v Charles of the Ritz Ltd (1988) 15 NSWLR 158 at 193 ( Ritz ), and said:\\n [Adapting] that language to the design context, the expression would embrace any person having a real interest in having the entry expunged and thus would include any person who would be or in respect of whom there is a reasonable possibility of his or her being 'appreciably disadvantaged in a legal or practical sense' by the entry not being expunged.\",\"7\":\"29 In my view delay in relation to the ADJR part of the proceeding is to be determined under s 11(4) and (5) and not under subs (3). In this case the applicant discovered the existence of the decision through its own resources. I agree with Pincus J in Australian Foreman Stevedores Association v Crone (1988) 20 FCR 377 that the expression \\\"furnished to the applicant\\\" contemplates delivery specifically to the applicant by the decision-maker. Accordingly the matter is to be approached under subss (4) and (5).\\n\\n30 It is common ground that the alleged delay in relation to the s 192 and s 39B parts of the case are to be dealt with on the same basis as the ADJR aspect, so that relief may be refused if application was not made within a reasonable time.\\n\\n31 A chronology of the relevant events will assist in understanding the parties' contentions on delay.\\n 14 January 2000 Extension of term granted 12 March 2002 Applicant incorporated May 2003 Applicant signed agreement with EBEWE Pharma Late May 2005, 2006- 2007 Dr Schnait of EBEWE Pharma tells Mr Gray that while Lilly had an Austrian patent for the product he could find no equivalent patent in Australia 2 August 2007 Applicant becomes aware of Australian patent and extension of term 12 October 2007 Applicant obtains patent file from IP Australia 26 October 2007 Applicant's TGA application 5 December 2007 Applicant writes to Lilly contending that extension of term was wrong and seeking confirmation of this 18 December 2007 Lilly sends letter of demand as to infringement 20 December 2007 Applicant seeks without prejudice meeting with Lilly to discuss commercial resolution 11 January to 27 February 2008 Communications about without prejudice meeting 28 February 2008 Without prejudice meeting 6 March 2008 Negotiations break down; Lilly sends second letter of demand 18 March 2008 Applicant informed of Austrian injunction 19 March 2008 Applicant seeks review of extension\"}}"
