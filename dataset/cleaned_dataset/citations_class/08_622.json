The orders are in accordance with the terms which Barrett J described in Re Porter at [10] and [12] as appropriate orders to be made in an application of this type.\\n\\n19 Accordingly I will make orders 1, 2 and 3 as set out in the originating process.

The effect of what his Honour said was that a further extension which would more than double the period permitted by the Act ought not to be made. The present order would not do so.\"}}"
