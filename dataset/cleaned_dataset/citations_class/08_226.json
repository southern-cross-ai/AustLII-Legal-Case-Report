His Honour found correctly that the Court could not engage in merits review and that findings of fact were uniquely within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal: SZKRL at [10] [11]; see Minister for Immigration & Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 272. No error is disclosed in his Honour's finding that the grounds pleaded by the appellant in her application failed to demonstrate any jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal.\\n\\n12 His Honour noted further that at the hearing before him the appellant also raised an allegation that the Tribunal's finding 'was not reasonable' because she was a genuine Falun Gong practitioner: SZKRL at [9]. His Honour found that this ground effectively amounted to the appellant expressing 'emphatic disagreement with the Tribunal's findings and decision'. His Honour found that such a complaint again invited impermissible merits review and could not succeed. For the reasons outlined at [11] above, no error is apparent in this approach.\\n\\n13 To the extent that the ground sought to allege that 'there was some illogicality or irrationality in the Tribunal's decision', his Honour found that there was no proper basis for such an allegation. His Honour found that the basis of the Tribunal's decision was 'clear', 'reasoned' and was 'open to it on the evidence before it' and that no jurisdictional error was disclosed: SZKRL at [12] [13].\\n\\n14 Accordingly, his Honour found that no jurisdictional error had been demonstrated on the part of the Tribunal and dismissed the application with costs: SZKRL at [14].\\n\\n15 The appellant was required to file and serve a notice of appeal within 21 days from the date the judgment appealed from was pronounced: Order 52 rule 15(1) of the Federal Court Rules 1979 ('the Rules'). His Honour delivered ex tempore reasons for judgment at the conclusion of the hearing on 26 October 2006. Accordingly, the appellant had to file and serve a notice of appeal on or before 16 November 2007. Instead, she filed an application for an extension of time to file and serve a notice of appeal on 28 November 2007, some 12 days outside the prescribed appeal period.\\n\\n18 The appellant has not advanced any explanation or any evidence for her inability to file a notice of appeal by 16 November 2007. In her affidavit sworn on 26 November 2007 and filed on 28 November 2007 in support of her application for an extension of time, the appellant simply restates her factual claims for refugee status and asserts that she disagrees with the decision of the Tribunal and that the 'RRT did not consider I am genuine Falun Gong Practitioner'. These matters amount to impermissible merits review and do not advance the appellant's case in any meaningful sense: Wu Shan Liang , ibid; NAHI v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural Affairs [2004] FCAFC 10.\",\"1\":\"16 The appellant now seeks an order pursuant to O 52 r 15(2) of the Rules, which provides that the Court or a Judge for 'special reasons may at any time give leave to file and serve a notice of appeal'. Accordingly, O 52 r 15(2) imposes a requirement that 'special reasons' exist (as to the nature of the power and what is meant by 'special reasons' see: Jess v Scott (1986) 12 FCR 187 at 195 196 per Lockhart, Sheppard and Burchett JJ), and even if that condition is fulfilled, it leaves a discretion to grant or refuse leave to appeal.\",\"2\":\"17 Whether or not special reasons is established will always be a question of fact and degree in each case: Minister for Immigration & Multicultural Affairs v Roda Kabail & Ors [1998] FCA 1320 per Tamberlin J. However, the special reasons criterion is not established in the present case. The appellant has failed to assert any basis that could be seen as meeting the 'special reasons' requirement.\",\"3\":\"18 The appellant has not advanced any explanation or any evidence for her inability to file a notice of appeal by 16 November 2007.

In his submissions, factors to be taken into account in the exercise of the discretion include the importance of the question sought to be raised by the proposed appeal, the bona fides of the proposed appeal and the prima facie strength of the proposed grounds of appeal: Howard v Australian Electoral Commission [2000] FCA 1767 per Branson J at [7].
