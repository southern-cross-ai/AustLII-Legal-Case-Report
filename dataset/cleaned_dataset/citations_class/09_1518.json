The deponent of the affidavit had not opposed an order for cross-examination. Flick J described the course of allowing cross-examination as unusual. His Honour did make the following observation (at [50]): \\n \\n \\\"As events unfolded, it [cross-examination] was probably the only effective means whereby the Applicants could have exposed what they believed were inadequacies in the existing discovery as provided particularly by the Fourth Respondent. As a result of the cross-examination, the Applicants were proved right. An order requiring a further affidavit to be filed in respect to particular documents, without knowledge of the manifest deficiencies in the existing discovery, may well have proved as ineffective as the discovery previously provided.\\\"\\n\\nIn my opinion, the examples given by the applicants of the insufficiency of the affidavit of discovery in relation to the five classes of documents in Schedule 2 demonstrate the insufficiency. I reject the respondents' contention that the affidavit of discovery is conclusive and that the Court is unable to make orders remedying the defects. In this case, the insufficiency of the affidavit appears on the face of the affidavit. At the same time, I do not think that this is a case where cross-examination should be ordered, at least at this stage. The respondents can be ordered to each file a further affidavit of discovery and this is not a case where there is no effective means other than cross-examination of preventing an injustice to the applicants.\\n\\nEach respondent must file a further affidavit of discovery in relation to the five classes of documents in Schedule 2 of the List of Documents. Further and better discovery or an order for particular discovery under O 15 r 8 (the orders sought in paragraphs 2 and 4 of the Motion)\\n\\nFor the reasons I have already given, I do not think that O 15 r 8 is incorporated into O 15A. In those circumstances, it is not open to me to make an order for particular discovery under O 15 r 8. Nevertheless, as I have said, an affidavit of discovery under O 15A may be insufficient, and an order may be made that a further affidavit of discovery be filed.\\n\\nThe principles are those set out above (see [28]-[34]). I must be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for being fairly certain that discoverable documents exist. I may not have regard to a contentious affidavit.\",\"10\":\"In Noel v Noel [1863] EngR 646 ; 1 D.J. & S. 468 , Turner LJ spoke of a reasonable suspicion that the deponent had more documents in his possession.

Before 1912, it was thought that the insufficiency had to appear from the pleadings, the affidavit of documents itself or the documents therein referred to. However, in British Association of Glass Bottle Manufacturers Ltd. v. Nettlefold , it was established that the insufficiency might appear not only from the documents but also from any other source that constituted an admission of the existence of a discoverable document. Furthermore, it is not necessary to infer the existence of a particular document; it is sufficient if it appears that a party has excluded documents under a misconception of the case. Beyond this, the affidavit of discovery is conclusive.\\\"\\n\\nAs the passage from Mulley v Manifold set out above makes clear, there are limits on the material which may be considered by a Court in determining the sufficiency of an affidavit of discovery. The most significant is that the insufficiency cannot be established by a contentious affidavit.\\n\\nThe insufficiency of an affidavit of discovery will ordinarily lead to an order requiring the filing of a further affidavit of discovery. It may, in certain limited circumstances, lead to an order allowing cross-examination of the deponent.

The case was a strong one because of the features identified in the following passage from his Honour's reasons: \\n \\n \\\"It seems to me that the evidence is at present in such a state as to raise serious doubts as to whether the process of the court is being abused by the defendants in relation to discovery. I have, of course, formed no concluded view about this. It would be quite improper for me to do so. I simply say that on the material now before the court serious questions have arisen as to the legitimacy of the position thus far taken by the defendants in relation to discovery. Discovery being of particular importance in this matter, it may well be that if the defendants are seeking illegitimately to avoid their obligations in this regard, the plaintiffs will be disadvantaged in a way which will not subsequently be able to be rectified. \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n The only process by which an important aspect of these proceedings can be explored at this stage is, it seems to me, by ordering the first defendant to attend for cross-examination.
