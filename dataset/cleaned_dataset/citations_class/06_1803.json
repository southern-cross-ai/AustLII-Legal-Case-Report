Section 477 is not a provision which makes a decision final and conclusive such that it may not be challenged, appealed against, reviewed or called into question in any court. It contemplates a challenge and provides a challenge to be made in a timely way. Section 474 , which was the subject of consideration in S157 , attempted to exclude a challenge in clear terms. It is evident that s 477 does not purport to preclude judicial review but imposes a limitation on the time for initiating that review. In these circumstances, I do not consider there is any substance in the submission that s 477 gives rise to a privative clause which is invalid or unconstitutional. In my view, it is appropriate to construe clauses fixing time limits with due regard to the necessity to ensure that courts are able to properly exercise their jurisdiction in a timely manner.\\n\\n15 Further submissions were made by counsel for the applicants regarding the desirability of having uniform extendable time limits for appeal and review of administrative decisions, as referred to in the Second Reading Speech for the Migration Litigation Reform Bill 2005 presented in March 2005. It is said that the purpose of s 477 is to avoid the potential unfairness of the strict 28 day time limit while ensuring timely handling of the application. In my view, the section does have the effect of extending the time limit and is a provision favourable to an applicant.\\n\\n16 I do not consider that there is anything incongruous, capricious or unreasonable in the application of s 477 in the circumstances of the present case. Accordingly, I do not accept the submission that the clear language of s 477 can or should be read down on the basis that it produces such results.\\n\\n17 Accordingly, for the above reasons, I am not persuaded that there has been any error demonstrated in the judgment of the Federal Magistrate and I dismiss this application with costs.\\n I certify that the preceding seventeen (17) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Tamberlin. \\n\\nAssociate: \\n\\nDated: 21 December 2006\\n\\n Counsel for the Applicants: S.
