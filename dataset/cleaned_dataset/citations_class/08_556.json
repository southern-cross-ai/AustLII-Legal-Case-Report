He claimed to have a well-founded fear of persecution in the Philippines by reason of his being a homosexual Muslim male in the Philippines. His application was refused by the Minister on 16 August 2005. The Tribunal affirmed that decision on 6 December 2005.\\n\\n3 The appellant outlined the basis for his claim to protection in writing on three occasions prior to the hearing before the Tribunal. His fundamental claim was that as a male Muslim homosexual he would be in an impossible position if he returned to the Philippines. His case was summed up in these words: \\n Muslim and gay. Two words that can not or must not or shall not or will not go together. Gay is a taboo in muslim society.\\n\\n4 He claimed to maintain his Muslim faith. He came from a large and powerful Muslim family from Mindanao and was a member of a particular tribe that adhered to the Muslim faith. His family was active in politics and he described his father as having been a warlord. He was the only homosexual in his family and was ostracised by his siblings for this reason. The situation was aggravated by the existence of Muslim radicals and terrorists, in particular the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). He claimed to suffer emotional and mental anguish. He claimed that his family would not protect him from harm and that:\\n the law of my country do not shield me in such familial and religious pressure. \\nHe referred to threats he had received after he refused to join the MILF. He feared connivance between his family and the MILF. He referred to an occasion in 2005 when three Muslim men with faces covered by handkerchiefs cut his long hair with scissors and threatened that next time they would cut his belly.\\n\\n5 His evidence to the Tribunal fleshed out his position. He said that in the 2005 incident the men said that if he kept on \\\"doing this\\\" they would cut his belly he took them to mean being a homosexual. He did not report the incident to the police because they would \\\"laugh, because I'm gay\\\". The Tribunal recorded the following:\\n He also stated that, as well as the local Muslim language, he spoke the non-Muslim languages of Tagalog and Bisayan, so people could not tell he was Muslim. His homosexual friends were all Christians. He did not reveal to people that he was from the [named] family or was Muslim, so that they would not tell his family anything about him.\",\"1\":\"20 The appellant apparently did not refer to any particular difficulties in living in Manila. However, the Tribunal does not report asking him about that topic or about the practicality of relocation or his fear of persecution if relocated. As far as the reasons for decision go, the Tribunal had no information from the appellant on those points. It is to be noted that the appellant said that he, in effect, disguised that he was Muslim (cf Appellant S395\\/2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 71 ; (2003) 216 CLR 473). It does not follow that there would not be persecution of Muslim male homosexuals in Manila simply because it is not predominantly a Muslim city. Again, it may well be that a properly directed Tribunal will find that relocation is an answer to the claim. I am not satisfied that such a finding is inevitable.\\n\\n21 The appeal will be allowed; the orders of the Federal Magistrates Court will be set aside; and, in lieu thereof, it will be ordered that the decision of the Tribunal be set aside and the matter remitted to the Tribunal for further decision according to law. The respondent Minister will pay the costs (if any) of the appellant of this appeal and of the Federal Magistrates Court proceeding.\\n\\n\\n I certify that the preceding twenty-one (21) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gyles. \\n\\n Associate:\\n\\nDated: 29 April 2008\\n\\n \\n The Appellant appeared in person \\n \\n Counsel for the First Respondent: Mr C Mantziaris \\n \\n Solicitor for the First Respondent: DLA Phillips Fox \\n\\n Date of Hearing: 1 November 2007 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 29 April 2008 \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2008\\/556.html\",\"2\":\"15 The gravamen of the appellant's claim for protection was his special position as a male Muslim homosexual in the Philippines. The Tribunal accepted that he was a male Muslim homosexual. However, it did not expressly refer to the consequences of that. Furthermore, the appellant is correct in submitting that none of the country information identified by the Tribunal referred to that circumstance. The Tribunal did not have to expressly deal with every matter raised by the appellant. However, it was obliged to deal with a discrete basis for protection put forward by him ( Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 26 ; (2003) 197 ALR 389 , (2003) 77 ALJR 1088 at [24] , [95]; Htun v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1802 ; (2001) 194 ALR 244 at [42] ). Put another way, the Tribunal did not identify the correct social group. Considering the greater class does not necessarily deal with the lesser ( SZBJH v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 501 at [35] [42]). The appellant's contention was, and is, that a male Muslim homosexual was in a different, and more vulnerable, position than other male homosexuals in the Philippines. That contention was not considered.\",\"3\":\"15 The gravamen of the appellant's claim for protection was his special position as a male Muslim homosexual in the Philippines.

It is submitted that neither serious harm nor systematic and discriminatory persecution was or could be established, referring to VBAO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 60 ; (2006) 231 ALR 544 ; (2006) 81 ALJR 475.\\n\\n18 It is not clear that this point was raised before the Federal Magistrates Court, and is not raised by notice of contention. In any event, the point is not decisive. In my opinion, if the appellant's case is taken at its highest, s 91R could possibly be met. He paints a serious picture as to the plight of a Muslim homosexual male suffering from crushing oppression, including psychological harm, physical harm and the threat of physical harm, with no effective State protection. I am not satisfied the Tribunal squarely dealt with that case. As I have said, the manner in which it dealt with particular incidents may have been coloured by the failure to focus upon the essence of the appellant's claim. Whilst the appellant may well have difficulty in persuading a properly directed Tribunal that the requirements of s 91R are met, I cannot rule out that possibility.\\n\\n19 It is also submitted by the Minister that the Federal Magistrate was correct in holding that the relocation finding by the Tribunal was decisive. The difficulty with that argument is that the Tribunal did not concentrate upon the position of a Muslim male homosexual from his family and his tribe in Manila or elsewhere other than Mindanao. He said in one of his communications to the Tribunal:\\n I cannot think of any place that is safe.\"}}"
