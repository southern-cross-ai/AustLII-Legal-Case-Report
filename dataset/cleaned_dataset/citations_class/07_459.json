ASP pointed to the different regime under which seafarers are employed in the offshore segment compared with the regime that operated in the blue water segment at the time of to the Seafarer's incapacity. The latter was regulated by the Award. Since at latest 2001, employment in the offshore segment has been regulated by enterprise agreements negotiated against the background of the different conditions that apply to employment in that segment as compared with employment in the blue water segment. Employment under such enterprise agreements involves a different factual matrix to employment under the Award (see Comcare v Thompson [2000] FCA 790 ; (2000) 175 ALR 163 at [45] ).\\n\\n24 ASP contended that the Tribunal made no error of law in its approach to the task of identifying a class to which the Seafarer belonged at the time of his incapacity. The Tribunal sought to find a category of employees whose basis of remuneration was sufficiently similar to that of the Seafarer for a conclusion to be reached that the Seafarer belonged to that class of employees. That, ASP said, involved no error of law and the Tribunal's conclusion that there are no longer employees in that class is a finding of fact.\\n\\n25 The essential question is whether the Tribunal adopted an erroneous approach to its task of identifying a class of employees to which the Seafarer belonged. It is a question of law as to what the phrase \\\" class to which [the Seafarer] belonged \\\" means when it is used in s 13(6). However, whether or not there is a continuing class, as the term is properly understood, to which the Seafarer belonged, is a question of fact which is within the province of the Tribunal alone. If the approach adopted by the Tribunal discloses a misapprehension of its task so as to indicate a misconception as to the meaning of \\\" class of employees to which [the Seafarer] belonged \\\" it made an error of law.\",\"1\":\"22 For example, there may be instances in which persons with such a common interest may be identified by the type of work that they perform, the qualifications that they hold, the category or level of position that they hold or any combination of these or other features. It is imperative, however, that regard is had to the features that identified those who had \\\" a common interest \\\" in remuneration at the date of the Seafarer's incapacity. Particular reference was made by ASP to a decision of the Tribunal relied upon by a Tribunal in this case: Re Thompson and Comcare [2002] AATA 733 ; (2002) 69 ALD 762 at [28] .\"}}"
