There is no opposition from the solicitor for the respondent to the leave to discontinue sought by the applicant being granted by me and I grant that leave. The Notice of Discontinuance may be filed in Court.\",\"1\":\"It will be remembered that, on 12 January 2009, when I delivered judgment on the applicant's interlocutory application ( Sebel Furniture Limited v Acoustic & Felts Pty Limited [2009] FCA 6) , I made an order for costs in respect of that application, the terms of that particular order being: \\n The applicant pay the respondent's costs of and incidental to the interlocutory hearing which took place before the Court on 23 December last.\\n\\nI have been informed that no further evidence has been filed by either party since the last directions hearing which was held on 5 February 2009. This is not a matter of criticism, as it seems that the parties have been attempting to resolve the matter.\\n\\nI think that costs to date will have been incurred in relation to three broad subject matters, namely: \\n(1) Work done in relation to the interlocutory hearing;\\n \\n(2) Work done on the balance of the proceedings (including the disqualification application but excluding the interlocutory hearing and excluding the Cross-Claim); and\\n \\n(3) Work done in relation to the Cross-Claim.\"}}"
