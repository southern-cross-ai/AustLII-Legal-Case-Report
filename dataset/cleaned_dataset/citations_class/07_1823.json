I did not afford his evidence any weight, because as I found, he was significantly misdirected by Metricon on a number of significant matters and was not told in the witness box before giving evidence about significant revisions to Metricon's witness statements. As a result, his opinions as to independent derivation were founded upon significantly incorrect assumptions and were of no real assistance to the Court. One example of this was that he incorrectly assumed that the Tyrell, Connolly and Streeton designs and homes were not designed by reference to the Prada 35. In fact, as I found, they were. He did not deal expressly in his report with the actual design drawings from which, according to the respondents, Prototypes 20A and 20B were derived. He assumed that certain evidence given by Bugeja, but which was disavowed by him at trial, was correct and he relied upon it. He accepted that Gallery 32 was used in the derivation of Prada 35. It was not. [252]-[256] Furthermore the applicants put the respondents on notice that Mr Permewan had been misinstructed. The solicitors for the applicants wrote to the respondents' solicitors by letter dated 9 October 2006 stating amongst other things that: \\n \\n Mr Permewan has proffered views about whether or not copying occurred by reference to his beliefs based on the untested evidence of Metricon's witnesses. It is clear from his report that Mr Permewan has taken as truthful, and without qualification, the evidence of Metricon's lay witnesses. I accept that consideration of Mr Permewan's affidavit evidence would have required significant amount of time before analysis on the part of the applicants' solicitors and counsel and indeed also by Dr John Cooke the expert architect obtained by the applicants. The matters deposed to by these lay witnesses may be overridden by the impressions formed by the Court following cross-examination.\\n\\n21 The respondents should be ordered to pay costs on an indemnity basis to the extent of 50% of the preparation for trial and for the trial itself. The order should cover the period from early April 2006 when the respondents filed the first of the affidavits of Bugeja, Popple, Palazzesi and Biasin.\",\"8\":\"32 I would think it likely that leave to appeal will be granted.

I accept that submission. However the question before me concerns the conduct of the respondents in relation to the related issues of derivation and copying. These are discrete issues and may be considered as such. The respondents say that there is nothing to warrant departure from the usual rule as to costs. They refer to Hamod v New South Wales (2002) 188 ALR 659 where Gray J (Carr and Goldberg JJ agreeing) said at [20]: \\n \\n 'Indemnity costs are not designed to punish a party for persisting with a case that turns out to fail. They are not awarded as a means of deterring litigants from putting forward arguments that might be attended by uncertainty. Rather, they serve the purpose of compensating a party fully for costs incurred, as a normal costs order could not be expected to do, when the court takes the view that it was unreasonable for the party against whom the order is made to have subjected the innocent party to the expenditure of costs.' (Emphasis added)\\n \\n\\nThe fact that the respondents' case on derivation and copying was rejected, it was submitted, does not lead inevitably to a grant of indemnity costs. That is so.\\n\\n16 The question then is whether the respondents' conduct in relation to its defence on the issues of derivation and copying constitutes a sufficient reason to take this case, in that respect, out of the ordinary, so far as concerns the exercise of my discretion on the question of costs. I am persuaded that it does. This is not a case where merely arguments 'attended by uncertainty' were before the Court as in Hamod [20]. It is not a case involving witnesses who gave evidence believing it to be true but as to which they were mistaken. It is not a case where judgment depended essentially upon the inherent probabilities of one version of events against another but not involving questions of credit. It is not even a case, such as Walker, where one witness gave fabricated evidence as to part of a case. This matter involved a concerted effort on the part of four key witnesses to present a false defence which has led to the applicants incurring very considerable costs over a long period in meeting and overcoming that defence. The submissions put to me on behalf of the respondents concerning the abandonment by the applicants of its case for infringement of the whole of the Copyright Works, as opposed to merely a substantial part and the abandonment of cases involving houses other than the accused homes, do not respond to the application for indemnity costs. There was no application by the respondents for any variation of a normal costs order by reference to these matters and I did not treat the submissions concerning those separate issues as such. I am concerned merely with the issues of derivation and copying.\",\"11\":\"3 An award of costs is in the discretion of the Court or Judge except as provided by any other Act: Federal Court of Australia Act s 43(2).

I will grant liberty to apply in this respect to allow for any unforeseen and undue delay in that determination. \\n \\n\\n I certify that the preceding thirty-four (34) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gilmour. \\n\\n\\n Associate: \\n\\nDated: 23 November 2007\\n\\n\\n Counsel for the Applicants: Mr C Golvan SC \\n \\n Solicitors for the Applicants: Middletons \\n \\n Counsel for the Respondent: Mr D Catterns QC with Dr W Rothnie \\n \\n Solicitors for the Respondent: Blake Dawson Waldron \\n \\n Date of Hearing: 30 October 2007 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 23 November 2007 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2007\\/1823.html\",\"23\":\"12 The respondents contend that their conduct in this case does not fit within that description. It is said that even a finding that a party has fabricated evidence is not necessarily sufficient to warrant the grant of an indemnity costs order. That is so. An example of that can be found in Walker v Citygroup Global Markets Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1866 at [31] - [32] . However, each case requires to be considered on its own facts. In that case, there had been a finding that a witness was unreliable which included a finding that he had fabricated some of his evidence to support the respondents' case. However Kenny J concluded at [32], in the context of the entire proceeding, that the conduct of that witness did not take the case so far outside the ordinary range of cases as to justify an award of indemnity costs. In the end, that was a matter of judgment upon the particular facts.\\n\\n13 In this case, on the issues of derivation and copying, I made findings of a conscious and deliberate effort on the part of the respondents to mislead the Court on both of those matters. These were of central importance in the case. Had those attempts to mislead been successful, it would have seen the case determined in favour of the respondents. It is, relevant in this context, to consider particular facts and findings relating to the evidence, both oral and written given by Bujega, Popple, Palazesi and Biasin who were the key witnesses called by the respondents: \\n \\n\\u2022 They were senior employees and in the case of Mr Palazzesi, the managing director of Metricon; [131] \\n \\n\\u2022 Evidence containing important and essential factual matters going to the issue of derivation were disavowed by Bugeja at trial without explanation other than that the material could be arguably misleading; [180] \\n \\n\\u2022 Popple too, disavowed important affidavit evidence at the trial, which went to the core of the respondents' case on derivation; [181], [182] \\n \\n\\u2022 Exhibit JMB 28, proffered as proof of an independent derivation path, was deliberately misleading; [207] \\n \\n\\u2022 Popple deliberately omitted important information from his affidavit because it was inconsistent with his written evidence which pointed to an independent design path; [215] \\n \\n\\u2022 Chronology Mk I and Mk II also proffered as proof of an independent derivation path were deliberately misleading in important respects and indeed were almost entirely misleading; [218] \\n \\n\\u2022 The explanations given by Popple and Bujega that the Prada 35 was a result of modifications to the Gallery 32 design as well as the Eldridge design were false; [223] \\n \\n\\u2022 Bugeja deliberately copied the alfresco quadrant from the Seattle 31 despite his denial; [225]\\n \\n\\u2022 Popple knew that Prototype 20B was copied from the Seattle 31; [226]\\n \\n\\u2022 There was conscious copying of the Seattle 31 design and\\/or display home as to the alfresco quadrant by Metricon in producing Prototype 20B and in turn the Prada 35; [226], [227]\\n \\n\\u2022 Palazzesi, in his pre-trial affidavits sought to create the false impression of his close involvement in an independently created design of the Prada 35; [275] \\n \\n\\u2022 The explanation by Palazzesi and Popple that the Gallery design was discussed as a basis for producing the Prototype 20A, Prototype 20B and the Prada 35 was an after the fact explanation concocted in order to establish an independent design path; [277] and\\n \\n\\u2022 Ultimately in cross-examination, Popple conceded that the other accused homes namely the Tyrell, Streeton and Connolly designs were produced by reference to Prototype 20B and the Prada 35. [290]\\n\\n14 These illustrate a determined effort on the part of the respondents and their witnesses to establish a defence on one of the central issues in the case which they knew to be false. It was left to the forensic efforts of the applicants' solicitors and counsel and some belated and limited concessions made by Popple and Bugeja during their oral evidence, which led to these attempts to mislead the Court being exposed.\\n\\n15 The result of this was that very significant costs have been incurred by the applicants both in preparation for and the conduct of the trial which ought never to have been required. Had this not been done then only those issues legitimately before the Court involving both questions of fact and law would have been tried.\\n\\n16 The question then is whether the respondents' conduct in relation to its defence on the issues of derivation and copying constitutes a sufficient reason to take this case, in that respect, out of the ordinary, so far as concerns the exercise of my discretion on the question of costs. I am persuaded that it does. This is not a case where merely arguments 'attended by uncertainty' were before the Court as in Hamod [20]. It is not a case involving witnesses who gave evidence believing it to be true but as to which they were mistaken. It is not a case where judgment depended essentially upon the inherent probabilities of one version of events against another but not involving questions of credit. It is not even a case, such as Walker, where one witness gave fabricated evidence as to part of a case. This matter involved a concerted effort on the part of four key witnesses to present a false defence which has led to the applicants incurring very considerable costs over a long period in meeting and overcoming that defence. The submissions put to me on behalf of the respondents concerning the abandonment by the applicants of its case for infringement of the whole of the Copyright Works, as opposed to merely a substantial part and the abandonment of cases involving houses other than the accused homes, do not respond to the application for indemnity costs. There was no application by the respondents for any variation of a normal costs order by reference to these matters and I did not treat the submissions concerning those separate issues as such. I am concerned merely with the issues of derivation and copying.\",\"24\":\"32 I would think it likely that leave to appeal will be granted.
