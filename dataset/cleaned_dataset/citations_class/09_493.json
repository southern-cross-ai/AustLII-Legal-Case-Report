In an appropriate case the Court may exercise its discretion to determine such a dispute rather than to stay the winding-up application to await the curial resolution of the dispute: Ocean City Ltd v Southern Oceanic Hotels Pty Ltd [1993] FCA 86 ; (1993) 10 ACSR 483 at 486-487.\\n\\nA great deal of evidence was adduced in this respect including detailed cross-examination of, amongst others, Mr Carey, Ms Karen Carey and Mr Gregory Nairn, a former senior Lanepoint executive. No suggestion was made that there was other relevant evidence available going to the resolution of this question. If such an alleged dispute is raised and can be resolved during such an application then in my opinion it ought to be. It would only add to the costs of the parties as well as to the public to put it off.\\n\\nLanepoint submits that the affidavit of ASIC's expert, Mr Honey, sworn on 27 October 2006 confirms the following: \\n (i) The work in progress on the Regency Motel redevelopment was, as at 31 January 2006, about $7 million. That work in progress is also estimated by Ernst & Young at $6,544,235 according to the affidavit of Mr Fraser, one of Lanepoint's receivers, sworn on 11 March 2008, based on information provided but that the Receiver and Managers were not able to determine the final quantum of renovation costs.\\\" \\n\\n \\n (ii) In relation to liabilities as at 31 January 2006, the Suncorp Metway loan stood at $4,855,000 and WIF at $2,267,000. \\n\\n \\n (iii) There were intercompany loans to Westpoint, Keypoint and Keyworld at $864,000 but there were other sources of finance of some $700,000\",\"8\":\"The commercial solvency of a company is not proved by merely looking at its accounts and making a mechanical comparison of its assets and liabilities. Insolvency is a question of fact falling to be decided as a matter of commercial reality in light of all the circumstances with things being viewed as it would be by someone operating in a practical business environment: Powell v Fryer (2000) 18 ACLC 480 at [9].\\n\\nThe background is uncontroversial and the following is taken substantially from ASIC's closing submissions. Lanepoint redeveloped the Regency Motel site on Great Eastern Highway, Rivervale in Western Australia. This was financed, in part, by secured funds obtained from Suncorp Metway Limited and Westpoint Management Pty Ltd as responsible entity for the Westpoint Income Fund (\\\"WIF\\\"). Westpoint Management was a related or associated company within the Westpoint Group and WIF was a managed investment scheme, which raised funds from the public for use in relation to Westpoint Group projects.\\n\\nThe first stage of the Regency Motel redevelopment was undertaken for Lanepoint by Westpoint Constructions Pty Ltd. As a result of the redevelopment 40 strata title lots were almost completed for sale and one lot was left vacant for the second stage. Adjacent to the redeveloped property are three lots, which were proposed for the third stage.\"}}"
