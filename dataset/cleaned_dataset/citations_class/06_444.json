More particularly it is not asserted that Sons of Gwalia Ltd acquired its interest in the mining lease and associated property other than as a 'bona fide' purchaser for value without notice. Apart from the insurmountable difficulties that would usually face a party attempting to have a Deed of Settlement set aside it is obvious that this proceeding against the defendants has no prospect of success seeking as it does an order against the defendants in respect of their rejection of the proof of debt lodged by the plaintiff.
