This is particularly so when they had about two weeks to reflect on their position before coming to Court on the final day of the hearing to present their submissions. In those circumstances, I consider that the plaintiff should have her costs with respect to the hearing on 28 November 2007 paid on an indemnity basis. Indeed, ultimately, counsel for the defendants did not oppose that course. There is no reason to depart from the usual order that costs follow the event in respect of the balance of the proceedings.\\n\\n9 The remaining issue requiring resolution is which of the defendants should pay the plaintiff's costs. The plaintiff contends that it should be the first and second defendants. The defendants submit that it should be the first defendant only. I agree with the later submission. The first defendant was the key decision maker for the defendants. The second defendant is an elderly lady and her actions as a director of the third and fourth defendants were influenced by the first defendant. The evidence bears out that he decided, without reference to the second defendant, to deny the plaintiff her correct entitlement to shares in the third and fourth defendants.\\n\\n10 As each party has had some degree of success in the matters requiring resolution today, no order will be made concerning the costs of today's hearing.\"}}"
