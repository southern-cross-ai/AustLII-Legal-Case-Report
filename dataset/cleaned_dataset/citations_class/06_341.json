But his Honour went on to say:-\\n \\\"At the same time, however, the opportunity to make relevant submissions, to give evidence, and to call witnesses in support which must be afforded will always be qualified by a requirement that the material and arguments sought to be presented must be sufficiently relevant and significant to warrant being received.\\\"\\n\\n29 The power of the AAT to control the proceeding so as to ensure compliance with these principles is found in s 33(1)(a) of the AAT Act . That subsection provides that the procedure of the AAT is, subject to the AAT Act and the Regulations and any other enactment, within the discretion of the AAT.\\n\\n30 There were only two real issues in the proceeding before Senior Member Kelly. The first was whether there were documents in the possession of CRS which were the subject of the applicant's request. The second was whether CRS had taken all reasonable steps to search for such documents. The learned Senior Member was plainly entitled to control the hearing and to limit examination or cross-examination so as to ensure some semblance of relevance to the real issues.\",\"7\":\"27 It may be accepted as a general statement of principle that if directions are given by a court or tribunal that have the effect of fettering cross-examination so that a witness's evidence on relevant issues cannot be properly tested, there is a denial of procedural fairness.
