The width of that section was firmly established in Australasian Memory Pty Ltd v Brien [2000] HCA 30 ; (2000) 200 CLR 270 at 281 282 and has been applied in many circumstances since that time. Administrations vary greatly and s 447A provides the necessary flexibility if the object of Pt 5.3A set out in s 435A is to be realised.\\n\\n16 The respondent EPG companies (by their administrators) appeared and consented to the orders sought. Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) was advised of the intention to bring the proceeding and was supplied with draft documents. The responsible officer noted that ASIC took no formal position in relation to the application, it being a commercial matter for the parties, and advised that ASIC would not be appearing. No other party was served or given notice of the application.\\n\\n17 As the administrators of the various companies represent the interests of unsecured creditors, the only other potential parties possibly affected are the other secured creditors of the relevant respondent EPG companies. I accepted the submission of counsel for the applicants that the interests of such creditors are not affected in a manner which would make them necessary parties to this application. The result of this application does not affect the rights of any secured creditor in relation to the enforcement of its security. However, it seemed to me that, rather than make an order applicable only to the charges held by ACR over property of the relevant EPG respondent companies, the extension should be in general terms so as to avoid any possible argument that any other secured creditor had been disadvantaged by a special deal. There was not time on 12 June 2007 for any great reflection about that matter and the form of this order should not be taken as a precedent.\",\"1\":\"12 The ACR Administrators did consider an alternative course, namely, to seek to enter a deed or some other form of agreement with the EPG Administrators under which they would give consent under s 440B(a) to ACR enforcing its securities after the \\\"decision period\\\" had expired. The ACR Administrators considered that there was a risk that a court would find that an agreement which fetters the future exercise of discretion and fiduciary obligations by administrators in such a manner would not be enforceable.
