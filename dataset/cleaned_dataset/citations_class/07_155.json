As the Federal Magistrate found, the Tribunal's decision turned on the Tribunal's assessment of the appellant's evidence at the hearing and did not rely upon any information which fell within the scope of the obligation in s 424A(1). His Honour found the Tribunal was not required to give written particulars of the information referred to under the heading 'Country Information' because that material fell within the exception in s 424A(3)(a) of the Act: Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs v NAMW [2004] FCAFC 264 ; (2004) 140 FCR 572. I agree with the conclusion and reasoning of the Federal Magistrate.\",\"1\":\"8 The first ground of appeal asserts that the Tribunal was biased because it did not believe, and failed to consider, the appellant's claims. I agree with the Federal Magistrate's finding, that there is no basis to conclude that the Tribunal's decision was affected by actual or apprehended bias: SCAA v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 668 ; VFAB v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 872 ; (2003) 131 FCR 102.\",\"2\":\"10 Mr Jordan of counsel, who appeared for the first respondent, brought to my attention the High Court of Australia decision in SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 ; (2006) 231 ALR 592 (' SZBEL '), and indicated that in light of s 422B of the Act (which did not apply in SZBEL but does in this appeal) the principles enunciated by the High Court of Australia may not be relevant to my considerations. I need not examine this issue because in my view, at the hearing, the Tribunal did identify the issues upon which its decision was based and gave the appellant the opportunity to address the issues and make submissions. Accordingly, there is no basis upon which to find the Tribunal breached procedural fairness in circumstances such as those in SZBEL assuming that the principles enunciated therein apply to this appeal.\\n\\n11 I will therefore order that the appeal be dismissed. I will also make orders that the title of the first respondent be changed to Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and the Tribunal be joined as the second respondent to this appeal.\\n\\n I certify that the preceding eleven (11) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Middleton. \\n\\n\\n Associate:\\n\\nDated: 20 February 2007\\n\\n\\n Counsel for the Appellant: The Appellant appeared in person \\n \\n Counsel for the Respondent: D Jordan \\n \\n Solicitor for the Respondent: Blake Dawson Waldron \\n \\n Date of Hearing: 14 February 2007 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 14 February 2007 \\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2007\\/155.html\",\"3\":\"\",\"4\":\"8 The first ground of appeal asserts that the Tribunal was biased because it did not believe, and failed to consider, the appellant's claims.
