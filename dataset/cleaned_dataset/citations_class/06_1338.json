The appeal to this Court is to correct error in the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court. The ground of appeal sought to be relied upon does not relate to any such error. Furthermore, the ground involves a question of fact not raised before the Federal Magistrates Court. The application to amend is misconceived ( Coulton v Holcombe [1986] HCA 33 ; (1986) 162 CLR 1).

Counsel for the appellants then sought leave to further amend the notice of appeal by taking one ground as follows: \\n \\n \\n '1. The Tribunal constructed a jurisdictional error when it failed to comply with s 424A of the M igration Act 1958 Cth \\n \\n Particulars \\n \\n \\n \\n (a) The Tribunal considered the following information was part of the reason for affirming the decision of the delegate to refuse the applicants protection visas: \\n \\n \\n \\n (i) The applicant husbands education and employment history provided in the protection visa record. \\n \\n \\n \\n (b) The Tribunal did not disclose the particulars of the information to the applicants in writing. \\n (c) The information was not exempted from disclosure by s 424A(3)(b). \\n (d) The information was specifically about the applicant husband.'\\n\\nThe amendment was opposed on two bases. Firstly an entirely new point should not be permitted to be raised at this stage of an appeal in judicial review proceedings. Secondly the proposed ground raises a question of fact, namely, what was provided by or on behalf of the appellants to the Tribunal for the purposes of s 424A(3)(b). Counsel for the appellants submitted that it can be deduced from a reading of the decision of the Tribunal, taken with the documents which were before the Tribunal, that it had relied upon material supplied only in the visa application. However, counsel for the Minister correctly points out that that conclusion cannot be drawn in the absence of a transcript of what took place before the Tribunal. If the issue had been raised in the Federal Magistrates Court, the factual issue could and would have been properly investigated.\",\"4\":\"The consequence is that the case for the appellants stands or falls upon the use by the Tribunal of country information concerning document fraud in Bangladesh without having complied with s 424A in relation to that information.
