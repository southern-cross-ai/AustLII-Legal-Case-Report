The facts resulting in that conclusion are set out in paras [3] to [38] of the Primary Reasons. I do not propose to repeat them. These reasons for decision should be read with the Primary Reasons. I adopt the same defined terms in these reasons for decision.\\n\\n4 The parties accept that as a result of the Primary Reasons, Telstra committed the following two breaches:\\n \\n (1) a breach of cl 17.4 of the 2005 Enterprise Agreement, by not paying Mr McDonald at the higher rate of pay after his redeployment in April 2006; and\\n (2) a breach of cl 9.1 of the TRA, by not paying Mr McDonald severance pay at the higher rate of pay after Mr McDonald took voluntary redundancy in October 2006.\\n\\n5 The CEPU now seeks consequential relief for those breaches in the form of an imposition of a penalty under s 178 of the Industrial Relations Act 1988 (Cth) (\\\"the IR Act \\\") or s 719 of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) (\\\"the WR Act \\\") and additional declaratory relief. The Court has jurisdiction to grant declaratory relief under s 21 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).\",\"3\":\"10 The breach of cl 9.1 of the TRA is entirely reliant upon, and arises out of, substantially the same course of conduct as the primary breach: Gibbs v The Mayor, Councillors and Citizens of the City of Altona (1992) 37 FCR 216. Accordingly, any penalty would be determined by reference to the \\\"totality principle\\\": CPSU, The Community and Public Sector Union v Telstra Corporation Limited (2001) 108 IR 228.\\n\\n15 Thirdly, in those circumstances, it is appropriate to determine the penalty by reference to the \\\"totality principle\\\" as described by Finkelstein J in CPSU, The Community and Public Sector Union v Telstra Corporation Limited (2001) 108 IR 228 at 230 and Textile Clothing & Footwear Union of Australia v Lotus Cove Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 43 at [44] . So much was conceded by the CEPU and by Telstra.\\n\\n19 The Court should not be concerned to reimburse an applicant for costs incurred in bringing the application by the imposition of a penalty under s 719 of the WR Act . The legislative policy of the WR Act in relation to costs is found in s 824 of the WR Act , which states that a party should not pay costs except in two prescribed circumstances. In light of this policy, it would be inappropriate to impose a penalty for the purpose of reimbursement: Finance Sector Union v Commonwealth Bank of Australia (2005) 224 ALR 467 at [63]-[64]; Victoria University of Technology v Australian Education Union (1999) 91 IR 96 at [34].

Neither breach was flagrant, wilful or deliberate. Amendments to the WR Act increasing the penalty for breaches of industrial instruments arising out of unlawful industrial conduct indicate a legislative desire to deter and discourage such conduct. These changes in industrial law have led to general deterrence being referred to as the \\\"most significant factor\\\" in determining the applicable penalty: see Finance Sector Union v Commonwealth Bank of Australia (2005) 224 ALR 467 at [60], [72]. Where the unlawful conduct arises out of an arguable but erroneous construction of a relevant term, and the subsequent breach cannot be characterised as demonstrating a flagrant or wilful disregard for the agreement, this legislative purpose is not furthered by imposition of a penalty. In these circumstances, neither general nor specific deterrence is a significant factor weighing in favour of imposing a penalty. Moreover, Mr McDonald has been fully compensated for the loss suffered as a result of the breach. I do not consider that the circumstances in which the conduct took place warrant the Court exercising its discretion to impose a penalty on Telstra.\\n\\n19 The Court should not be concerned to reimburse an applicant for costs incurred in bringing the application by the imposition of a penalty under s 719 of the WR Act .

In support of those contentions, Telstra referred to the following facts and matters:\\n \\n (1) there was no element of wilful or deliberate non-compliance by Telstra;\\n \\n (2) Mr McDonald's job was redundant and he was to be retrenched unless otherwise redeployed. Instead of retrenching Mr McDonald, Telstra accepted his request to redeploy him to a job more than two pay classification levels below his current employment. Telstra did not have to do so;\\n (3) Telstra accepted the redeployment of Mr McDonald on a genuine but mistaken belief that it was only required to pay Mr McDonald the lower rate of pay;\\n (4) the CEPU did not suggest that Telstra had any relevant \\\"prior convictions\\\". There is nothing to suggest that Telstra is disposed to contravene certified agreements to which it is a party. In those circumstances, no specific deterrence is relevant;\\n (5) Telstra is a very large employer with employees across Australia and has been bound by numerous awards and certified agreements over the years;\\n (6) a penalty would serve no remedial purpose. Mr McDonald will be fully compensated by the order made on 2 October 2007 in the Primary Reasons;\\n (7) the Court cannot be influenced by any concern to reimburse the applicant or Mr McDonald for costs incurred in prosecuting the application: Victoria University of Technology v Australian Education Union (1999) 91 IR 96 at [34];\\n (8) finally, although a penalty acts as a general deterrence, such deterrence is relevant where the obligations are clear, even if the employer was ignorant of the obligation.
