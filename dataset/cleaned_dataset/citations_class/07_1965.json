Section 4L provides:\\n \\n \\\"If the making of a contract after the commencement of this section contravenes this Act by reason of the inclusion of a particular provision in the contract, then, subject to any order made under section 87 or 87A, nothing in this Act affects the validity or enforceability of the contract otherwise than in relation to that provision in so far as that provision is severable.\\\"\\n \\n\\nBecause of what I say below, I would emphasise that this provision on its proper construction requires severance of offending provisions: see SST Consulting Services Pty Ltd v Rieson [2006] HCA 31 ; (2006) 225 CLR 516 at [51] ; but that it operates subject to any order made under s 87 and it is upon s 87(3) that the respondents rely in particular.\\n\\n12 Section 4M, a companion provision, provides, insofar as presently relevant, that: \\n \\n \\\"This Act does not affect the operation of:\\n \\n \\n \\n (a) the law relating to restraint of trade in so far as that law is capable of operating concurrently with this Act; \\n \\n ...\\n \\n \\n \\n but nothing in the law referred to in paragraph (a) ... affects the interpretation of this Act.\\\"\\n\\n18 In this matter the respondents seek to do no more than to put that matter in issue, albeit contingently because their primary position is that the restraints are inoffensive at common law in any event. But if they are incorrect in that, and if the restraints are exclusionary provisions the applicants frankly concede they are and contravene s 45(2)(a) , the respondents, as of course, are entitled to apply for an order under s 87(3) to have the restraints varied. They equally are entitled, subject to any order made under s 87 , to have the issue of severance under s 4L determined: see SST Consulting Services Pty Ltd v Rieson .\\n\\n19 By relying simply upon a common law claim in the present factual setting, the applicants have perforce exposed themselves to the defensive use the respondents seek to make of the TP Act.\\n\\n20 I grant the leave to amend that has been sought.\\n\\n120 The respondents have not made submissions to the effect that the offensive parts of the restraints could be severed: cf SST Consulting Services Pty Ltd v Rieson [2006] HCA 31 ; (2006) 225 CLR 516 at [46] ; or that the \\\"reading down\\\" provision of the deed poll would permit the court to make an inoffensive agreement for the parties which they did not make themselves. The obvious reason for their not taking either of these course lies in their TP Act claims to which I now turn.\\n\\n121 There are four tiers of questions which possibly arise in relation to the respondents' claim. The first is whether as exclusionary provisions, the Deed Poll restraints contravene s 45(2)(a) of the TP Act. The second is whether, on the application of the respondents, the Court should grant relief under s 87(3) of the Act so as to vary the contract in a manner it considers just and equitable. The third is whether, again on the respondents' application, the Court should grant relief under s 87(1) favourable to the applicants by way of varying the Deed Poll's restraints so as to prevent or reduce loss or damage to the applicants. The fourth is whether the offending restraints ought be severed under s 4L of the TP Act.\\n\\n122 For reasons I later give it is only necessary to deal with the second of these in any detail.\\n\\n134 I need not repeat here the terms of s 4L save to note that the severance requirement imposed by the section: see SST Consulting Services Pty Ltd v Rieson , at [52]; is expressly made \\\"subject to any order under section 87\\\". I propose to make such an order and that order will render severance under s 4L unnecessary.\\n\\n135 I will direct the parties to bring in short minutes of order to give effect to my findings and conclusions. Additionally, I would note that while it is provided expressly in the Deed Poll of Restraint that it does not supersede the Heads of Agreement (see cl 7), no relief has been sought in this proceeding in relation to that agreement.\\n\\n136 I will also direct the parties to file and serve written submissions on costs within seven days of the handing down of these reasons. \\n\\n I certify that the preceding one hundred and thirty-six (136) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Finn. \\n\\n\\n Associate:\\n\\nDated: 11 December 2007\\n\\n Counsel for the Applicants: Mr R Whitington QC with Mr N Rochow Solicitor for the Applicants: Cowell Clarke \\n \\n Counsel for the 1 st , 4 th , 7 th & 8 th Respondents: Mr W Wells QC with Mr T Duggan Solicitor for the 1 st , 4 th , 7 th & 8 th Respondents: Kelly & Co \\n \\n Counsel for the 2 nd , 3 rd , 5 th & 6 th Respondents: Mr M Evans Solicitor for the 2 nd , 3 rd , 5 th & 6 th Respondents: Iles Selley \\n \\n Date of Hearing: 22, 23, 24 and 30 October 2007 Date of Judgment: 11 December 2007 \\n\\n \\n \\n Appendix A\\n \\nAppendix B\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2007\\/1965.html\",\"1\":\"13 Section 51(2) provides for present purposes:\\n \\n \\n \\\"(2) In determining whether a contravention of [s 45] ... has been committed, regard shall not be had: \\n \\n ...\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n (e) in the case of a contract for the sale of a business or of shares in the capital of a body corporate carrying on a business to any provision of the contract that is solely for the protection of the purchaser in respect of the goodwill of the business\\\". \\n \\n \\n \\n\\nI simply note in passing that there is a live issue between the parties as to whether the transaction of which the impugned deed poll was part, was itself a sale contract of a type envisaged by subpara (3). The subpara also gives rise to the question whether, if the deed contained restraints that did not offend the common law of restraint of trade, it would for that reason fall within s 51(2)(e) (assuming the transaction was of the relevant type and the restraints related to the protection of goodwill): cf IRAF Pty Ltd v Graham (1982) 41 ALR 209 at 216.\\n\\n83 (ix) Protection of customer connection equally can contrive what is the acceptable duration of a restraint, hence the emphasis in the cases on the period reasonably to be allowed (a) to give the covenantee the opportunity \\\"of cementing an old connection and of profiting from an established reputation\\\": Brown v Brown , 490; and to establish a relationship with the customers of the business Carlton & United Breweries Ltd v Tooth & Co Ltd (1986) 7 IPR 581 at 614; and (b) for severing the relationship between the covenantor and those who would patronize the business of the sale: IRAF Pty Ltd v Graham , at 218.\\n\\n127 In the present case, though, guidance is to be found in s 51(2)(e) in that, as I noted at the beginning of these reasons, it exempts from s 45's purview, any provision of a contract for the sale of a business or of shares in the capital of a body corporate carrying on a business, \\\"that is solely for the protection of the purchaser in respect of the goodwill of the business\\\". It is unsurprising that the view has been expressed that:\\n \\n \\\"[t]he test provided by s 51(2)(e) seems ... to encapsulate the conditions which by the common law are required to bring a restraint relating to a business within the policy of the law\\\": see IRAF Pty Ltd v Graham , at 216.\\\"\",\"2\":\"14 Section 87(3) relevantly provides that:\\n \\n \\\"(3) Where:\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n (a) a provision of a contract made, or a covenant given, whether before or after the commencement of the Trade Practices Amendment Act 1977 : \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n (i) in the case of a provision of a contract, is unenforceable by reason of section 45 in so far as it confers rights or benefits or imposes duties or obligations on a corporation; \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n ...\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n the Court may, on the application of a party to the contract ... make an order: \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n (c) varying the contract ... or a collateral arrangement relating to the contract ... in such manner as the Court considers just and equitable.\\\"\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nI would again note in passing that the subsection unqualifiedly permits any party to the contract to apply for an order under it whether or not in a separate application. It is not limited to a party burdened by a provision that contravenes s 45 , let alone a party who has suffered, or is likely to suffer, loss or damage by the contravening conduct. In this last respect the subsection appears to be quite unlike s 87(1), (1A), (1B) and (2), each of which conditions the making of their respective orders \\\"upon the court finding that a party to the proceeding has suffered, or is likely to suffer, loss or damage\\\" (emphasis in original): I & L Securities Pty Ltd v HTW Valuers (Brisbane) Pty Ltd [2002] HCA 41 ; (2002) 210 CLR 109 at [46] . The manifest object of s 87(3) is to permit the \\\"restructuring on a just and equitable basis the rights and obligations of parties to contracts which have contravened certain sections [i.e. s 45 , s 45B and s 47] of the Act\\\": Heydon, Trade Practices Law , [18.1830]. The utility of a power so to do is obvious enough. Section 87(3)'s object contrasts with the object of s 87(1), (1A), (1B) and (2) which confer powers to make orders compensating, preventing or reducing loss or damage arising from breaches of the Act: ibid. I would note in passing that s 87(2)(b) would thus envisage that that object may in fact be furthered by an order varying a contract made between the person who suffered, or is likely to suffer, the loss or damage and the person who engaged in the contravening conduct.\",\"3\":\"15 I should also note that the Deed Poll of Restraint is, as its name signifies, a deed poll. The covenant of restraint is made in favour of, and for the benefit of, the first seven respondents who are named in the deed. As such, the covenant is enforceable by those respondents: see Re A & K Holdings Pty Ltd [1964] VR 257 at 261-262; Sunderland Marine Insurance Co v Kearney (1851) 16 QB 925 at 938. It is unnecessary for present purposes to enter upon the questions (a) whether a deed poll is properly to be called a \\\"contract\\\" at law at all: cf Chitty on Contracts , Vol 1 at 2-003 (29 th ed, 2004); Furmston (ed), The Law of Contract , 2.135 (2 nd ed, 2003); or (b) whether this deed poll in fact embodies a contract supported by consideration: cf cl 3 of the Deed (not reproduced here); or else is properly to be regarded as a part of the performance of the Heads of Agreement or as part of an entire transaction: cf Norton on Deeds 86-88 (2 nd ed, 1928). Given that the restraints are contained in an enforceable instrument that reflect what has been agreed by all relevant parties, if they are found to be unenforceable because they are exclusionary provisions that contravene s 45(2)(a) , I can see no reason consistent with the purpose and policy of s 87(3) for not treating them as provisions in a \\\"contract\\\" to which the covenantees are parties. To interpret s 87(3) in this way is to do no more than to give it a purposive and contextual interpretation: see CIC Insurance Ltd v Bankstown Football Club Ltd [1997] HCA 2 ; (1997) 187 CLR 384 at 408; Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth), s 15AB.\",\"4\":\"15 I should also note that the Deed Poll of Restraint is, as its name signifies, a deed poll.

Often the Act would be of no conceivable relevance in a simple common law claim. But when incapability is properly put in issue, the common law (including its remedies) will be displaced by the operation of the Act (including its remedies and relief) to the extent of that incapability.\",\"7\":\"72 In their final written submissions, the respondents appear to have taken a new tack in relation to goodwill. Relying upon Old Co's 30 June 2005 balance sheet it was annexed to a 29 November 2005 side agreement between Tiger, Mr James and PJMJ they now advance the following figures for (a) current assets of $12.47 million; (b) fixed assets of $6.53 million including $1.73 million for goodwill; and net equity of $3.74 million. It has not been explained what I am to make of these figures or what the $1.73 million figure should be taken actually to signify by reference to then contemporary accounting standards: cf Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Murry [1998] HCA 42 ; (1998) 193 CLR 605 at [13] - [14] .\\n\\n73 Though I am of the view that, given the provisions of s 4M of the TP Act, it would ordinarily be appropriate first to deal with the TP Act claim before a common law claim, because of the way in which this matter was prosecuted by the applicants and because of the dispute over the respondents' amendments to its defence, I am content to deal with the common law claim first and without regard to any possible impact of the TP Act upon it in the circumstances.\\n\\n74 Save in one respect to which I will refer below, there is no obvious disagreement between the parties as to the general principles to be applied in testing the validity of covenants in restraint of trade. There are, predictably, differences in matters of emphases and in the alleged utility of analogies selected from the rich bazaar of decided case law.\\n\\n80 (vi) The most recent elaboration of the legal nature of goodwill by the High Court was in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Murry at [12] ff. It is unnecessary for present purposes to enlarge upon what was there said other than to note that one of the definitions endorsed by the joint judgment was that of Lord Macnaghten in Inland Revenue Commissioners v Meuller & Co's Margarine Ltd [1901] AC 217 at 223-224 where it was said: \\n \\n \\\"What is goodwill? It is a thing very easy to describe, very difficult to define. It is the benefit and advantage of the good name, reputation, and connection of a business. It is the attractive force which brings in custom. It is the one thing which distinguishes an old-established business from a new business at its first start. The goodwill of a business must emanate from a particular centre or source. However widely extended or diffused its influence may be, goodwill is worth nothing unless it has power of attraction sufficient to bring customers home to the source from which it emanates. Goodwill is composed of a variety of elements. It differs in its composition in different trades and in different businesses in the same trade.\\\"\",\"8\":\"76 (i) Public policy lies at the root of the rule that contracts in restraint of trade are, prima facie, unenforceable: see Amoco Australia Pty Ltd v Rocca Brothers Motor Engineering Co Pty Ltd [1973] HCA 40 ; (1973) 133 CLR 288 at 307; Peters (WA) Ltd v Petersville Ltd [2001] HCA 45 ; (2001) 205 CLR 126 at [27] . The only justification for a restraint is if it is reasonable in reference to the interests of the parties and reasonable in the interests of the public: Nordenfelt v Maxim Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Co Ltd [1894] AC 535 at 565; Buckley v Tutty [1971] HCA 71 ; (1971) 125 CLR 353 at 376. The two requirements merge to some extent. As Walsh J observed in Amoco (at 307):\\n \\n \\\"... if a restraint is imposed which is more than that which is required (in the judgment of the court) to protect the interests of the parties, that is a matter which is relevant to the considerations of public policy which underlie the whole doctrine, since to that extent the deprivation of a person of his liberty of action is regarded as detrimental to the public interests ... I acknowledge that the consequence of what I have just stated is that there is to some extent a merging of the second branch of the Nordenfelt formulation of the applicable principle with its first branch. But this does not mean that the distinction between them is wholly obliterated. In order to justify a restraint of trade both tests must be satisfied. The restraint must be reasonable in the interests of the parties in that it affords no more than adequate protection to the covenantee 'while at the same time it is in no way injurious to the public' (see the Nordenfelt Case ). It may be that although a restraint satisfies the first requirement it is injurious to the public for some reason other than being in excess of what is reasonable in the interests of the parties.\\\"\\n\\n77 (ii) The onus of establishing that a restraint is reasonable as between the parties rests with the party who puts forward the restraint, while the onus of establishing that it is contrary to the public interest is on the party alleging this: Amoco , at 317.\\n \\n \\n (iii) \\\"The fact that the parties have bargained from a position of equality is ... one of the circumstances to be considered in determining whether the covenants were reasonable, but it does not save from invalidity a covenant found to be unreasonable or contrary to the public interest (see also Creamoata Ltd v Rice Equalization Association Ltd [(1953) [1953] HCA 40 ; 89 CLR 286 at 318].\\\"\\n \\n Per Gibbs J in Amoco , at 317. \\n \\n\\nThis is a proposition upon which the parties divide, the respondents emphasising that significant weight should be given in this regard to a commercial agreement reached \\\"after hard bargaining\\\" by parties, which each finds in its interests to accept: Amoco , per Menzies J (in dissent). Whether or not the observations of Menzies J accurately reflects Australian law is not a matter that I need consider as I do not consider that the Heads of Agreement represented \\\"an ordinary transaction between a willing vendor and a willing purchaser\\\": Brown v Brown [1980] 1 NZLR 484 at 489 per Cooke J. I will later return to this matter.\\n\\n78 (iv) The question of reasonableness is a question of law for the Court which ultimately depends upon \\\"a judgment the reasons for which do not admit of great elaboration\\\": Amoco , at 308. The validity of the restraint is to be determined as at the date of the agreement, though facts occurring after that date may be relevant if they throw light on the circumstances existing at the date of the restraint: Amoco , at 318.\\n\\n89 The 5 August 2005 agreement cannot on the evidence meaningfully be characterised as embodying an ordinary transaction between a willing vendor and a willing purchaser. The character Mr James gave the dealing which I accept \\\"a walk in walk out on the basis of a quick clear severance so they didn't have to look at each other much longer\\\" comes closer to the transaction described in Brown v Brown , between two brothers who carried on a business together through a corporate vehicle but who could no longer continue in business together (at 489):\\n \\n \\\"... it was a transaction forced on the parties, in effect a case of one partner buying out the other because unhappy differences had made co-operation impossible.\\\"\\n \\n\\nI mention this, not for the purpose of inquiring into the adequacy of the consideration for the restraint: cf Amoco , at 316; but rather to indicate that the circumstances surrounding the transaction do not warrant its being characterised as having been \\\"bargained from a position of equality\\\": cf Amoco , 317; and hence to be so considered in determining whether the restraints were reasonable.\",\"9\":\"76 (i) Public policy lies at the root of the rule that contracts in restraint of trade are, prima facie, unenforceable: see Amoco Australia Pty Ltd v Rocca Brothers Motor Engineering Co Pty Ltd [1973] HCA 40 ; (1973) 133 CLR 288 at 307; Peters (WA) Ltd v Petersville Ltd [2001] HCA 45 ; (2001) 205 CLR 126 at [27] . The only justification for a restraint is if it is reasonable in reference to the interests of the parties and reasonable in the interests of the public: Nordenfelt v Maxim Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Co Ltd [1894] AC 535 at 565; Buckley v Tutty [1971] HCA 71 ; (1971) 125 CLR 353 at 376.

It may be that although a restraint satisfies the first requirement it is injurious to the public for some reason other than being in excess of what is reasonable in the interests of the parties.\\\"\\n\\n128 It is not necessary for present purposes that I express a concluded view on the correctness of this observation. The burden of the subsection in the end is simply one of statutory interpretation. But what the s 51(2)(e) exception suggests for the purposes of the s 87(3) discretion is that there well could be circumstances in which it would be both appropriate and just and equitable to vary a restraint in a contract associated with the sale of an interest in a business so that it does no more than provide a level of protection that would be acceptable at common law for the policy reasons of the common law. Such an exercise of discretion would be permissible under s 87(3) in an appropriate case even if a provision valid at common law was not saved from contravening s 45 because of s 51(2)(e), i.e. because that provision did not operate in tandem with the common law: cf Peters (WA) Ltd v Petersville Ltd , at [46]-[50].\\n\\n129 I am satisfied that the present is a case in which a variation order should be made. I indicated in relation to the laundry hire restraint that I considered a three year period of restraint would appear to be reasonable as between the parties. I equally indicated that, save in relation to its extension into the Barossa Valley, the map tendered by the respondents (Appendix B to these reasons) delineates an area within which it would be reasonable to proscribe competition between the parties in relation to the applicants operating etc a laundry hire business. I also indicated what I consider to be the proper construction to be given the words \\\"operate\\\" and \\\"operation\\\" in the restraint but that, in any event, that meaning indicated what was a reasonable limit to the scope of the activities that could be the subject of an acceptable restraint.\\n\\n130 Accordingly, I would vary the Restraint clause as it relates to the laundry hire business so as \\n \\n (i) to limit the restraint to conducting, or being involved directly or indirectly, in the conduct of, a laundry hire business; \\n (ii) to limit the area of the restraint to that marked with a line in Appendix B to these reasons commencing at Aldinga and terminating at Barker Inlet but so as to exclude the area to the north between Williamstown, Tanunda and Gawler (i.e. the Barossa Valley); and \\n (iii) to limit the duration of the restraint to three years from the \\\"Completion Date\\\" a date defined in the Heads of Agreement.\",\"10\":\"76 (i) Public policy lies at the root of the rule that contracts in restraint of trade are, prima facie, unenforceable: see Amoco Australia Pty Ltd v Rocca Brothers Motor Engineering Co Pty Ltd [1973] HCA 40 ; (1973) 133 CLR 288 at 307; Peters (WA) Ltd v Petersville Ltd [2001] HCA 45 ; (2001) 205 CLR 126 at [27] . The only justification for a restraint is if it is reasonable in reference to the interests of the parties and reasonable in the interests of the public: Nordenfelt v Maxim Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Co Ltd [1894] AC 535 at 565; Buckley v Tutty [1971] HCA 71 ; (1971) 125 CLR 353 at 376. The two requirements merge to some extent. As Walsh J observed in Amoco (at 307):\\n \\n \\\"... if a restraint is imposed which is more than that which is required (in the judgment of the court) to protect the interests of the parties, that is a matter which is relevant to the considerations of public policy which underlie the whole doctrine, since to that extent the deprivation of a person of his liberty of action is regarded as detrimental to the public interests ... I acknowledge that the consequence of what I have just stated is that there is to some extent a merging of the second branch of the Nordenfelt formulation of the applicable principle with its first branch. But this does not mean that the distinction between them is wholly obliterated. In order to justify a restraint of trade both tests must be satisfied. The restraint must be reasonable in the interests of the parties in that it affords no more than adequate protection to the covenantee 'while at the same time it is in no way injurious to the public' (see the Nordenfelt Case ). It may be that although a restraint satisfies the first requirement it is injurious to the public for some reason other than being in excess of what is reasonable in the interests of the parties.\\\"\\n\\n82 (viii) The principal interest protected by restraints on competition on the sale of goodwill is customer connection, the customers being existing or potential customers. The protection of that interest in a given case can contrive what is the acceptable area or scope of a restraint: cf Whitehall v Bradford [1952] 1 Ch 236 esp at 249-250 where a ten mile radius restraint on a retiring partner of a medical practice was unsuccessfully challenged, the evidence establishing that, though the patients on the periphery of that area were small in number they contributed about one-third of the total partnership income; see also Kennett v Crawford [1940] SASR 199; C & S Constructions Pty Ltd v Dawson (1991) 13 ATPR 41-148 and Lloyd's Ships Holdings Pty Ltd v Davros Pty Ltd (1987) 17 FCR 505 at 524. Important in this regard for present purposes are observations of Viscount Maugham in the Privy Council in Connors Brothers Ltd v Connors [1940] 4 All ER 179 at 194 in the context of a covenant taken on the sale of a sardine business not to engage in any such business in Canada:\\n \\n \\\"... the question of reasonableness being a matter of law for the court, it has never yet been supposed that it is necessary in relation to the trade of a large manufacturer or merchant to prove to the satisfaction of the court that the business which the covenant is designed to protect has been carried on in every part of the area mentioned in the covenant. In the cases in which the area has been the whole of England, or a substantial part of it, such as 100 miles or 150 miles from a named town, it has never been held that the covenantee was under an obligation to prove that the business has been carried on in all the towns and villages within the area. In the Nordenfelt case, no attempt was made to prove that all the governments of the world, or even of the civilised world, had ordered goods from the company, though the greater number no doubt had done so. A great deal no doubt depends on the nature of the business and the area in question. In a country of vast spaces, like the Dominion of Canada, it will always be possible, until the population of the country reaches a point now scarcely contemplated, to point to areas where there are only few settlers or inhabitants, and where, accordingly, few, if any, of the goods sold by the manufacturer have penetrated. If, for example, a restrictive covenant were limited to the province of Quebec, it would seldom be possible to prove that the goods were used in every part of that province. However, the goodwill of a business such as is now under consideration could not adequately be protected if the restrictive covenant had to be limited to the towns and villages where actual sales could be proved, whilst leaving the vendor free to establish a business, which would almost certainly be competitive , in all the adjoining places.\\\"\\n (Emphasis added.

The character Mr James gave the dealing which I accept \\\"a walk in walk out on the basis of a quick clear severance so they didn't have to look at each other much longer\\\" comes closer to the transaction described in Brown v Brown , between two brothers who carried on a business together through a corporate vehicle but who could no longer continue in business together (at 489):\\n \\n \\\"... it was a transaction forced on the parties, in effect a case of one partner buying out the other because unhappy differences had made co-operation impossible.\\\"\\n \\n\\nI mention this, not for the purpose of inquiring into the adequacy of the consideration for the restraint: cf Amoco , at 316; but rather to indicate that the circumstances surrounding the transaction do not warrant its being characterised as having been \\\"bargained from a position of equality\\\": cf Amoco , 317; and hence to be so considered in determining whether the restraints were reasonable.\",\"13\":\"79 (v) The seller of the goodwill of a business or a person who relinquishes his or her interest in the goodwill of a business by retirement or sale to the continuing owners: cf Geraghty v Minter [1979] HCA 42 ; (1979) 142 CLR 177 at 193-194; is nonetheless entitled to set up a competing business: see generally Heydon, The Restraint of Trade Doctrine , Ch 8 (2 nd ed, 1999); unless a valid restraint protecting the goodwill of the business has been agreed.

It is unnecessary for present purposes to enlarge upon what was there said other than to note that one of the definitions endorsed by the joint judgment was that of Lord Macnaghten in Inland Revenue Commissioners v Meuller & Co's Margarine Ltd [1901] AC 217 at 223-224 where it was said: \\n \\n \\\"What is goodwill? It is a thing very easy to describe, very difficult to define. It is the benefit and advantage of the good name, reputation, and connection of a business. It is the attractive force which brings in custom. It is the one thing which distinguishes an old-established business from a new business at its first start. The goodwill of a business must emanate from a particular centre or source. However widely extended or diffused its influence may be, goodwill is worth nothing unless it has power of attraction sufficient to bring customers home to the source from which it emanates. Goodwill is composed of a variety of elements. It differs in its composition in different trades and in different businesses in the same trade.\\\"\",\"16\":\"82 (viii) The principal interest protected by restraints on competition on the sale of goodwill is customer connection, the customers being existing or potential customers.

Accordingly, I am not prepared to rely on the letter when construing the clause.\\n\\n110 The clause on its face prohibits the provision of dry cleaning services \\\"in competition with [Old Co]\\\" subject to one limitation which requires the satisfaction of both of two conditions. The prohibition does not apply to dry cleaning services which, at the date of the agreement:\\n \\n (a) were carried out by the applicants or their related entities; and \\n (b) were not carried out by the respondents or their related entities.\\n\\n111 An evaluation of the reasonableness of the restraint requires first and foremost an answer to the question: What dry cleaning services were provided by Old Co at the date of the Heads of Agreement? It was in relation to the provision of those services that the general prohibition on competition (subject to the limitation) was, seemingly, intended to operate.\",\"23\":\"126 I would note that an exclusionary provision of a contract, for present purposes, is one having the purpose of preventing, restricting or limiting supply or acquisition of services to or from particular persons or classes of person and the contract itself is between bodies corporate which, but for that provision, would be or be likely to be in competition in relation to the supply or acquisition of the services or goods to which the provision relates: s 4D and see News Ltd v South Sydney District Rugby League Football Club Ltd [2003] HCA 45 ; (2003) 215 CLR 563. Unless other, not presently relevant, requirements are not complied with, or unless another provision of the Act (including a subsection of s 45 itself) makes s 45 inapplicable in the circumstances: see e.g. s 51(2) and s 88(1); s 45 declares such a provision to contravene the Act regardless of its actual effect on competition. That it so operates, notwithstanding the object of the TP Act is to enhance the welfare of Australians through (inter alia) the promotion of competition and fair trading: s 2; gives little guidance as to how, consistently with the Act's object, the s 87(3) discretion ought be informed.\"}}"
