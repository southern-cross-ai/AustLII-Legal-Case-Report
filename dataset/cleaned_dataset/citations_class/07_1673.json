The bank clearly intended that any settlement should apply to all claims made by the Smolles, including their claims in relation to the Bond. Notably it had rejected the amended version of the Deed of Release, executed by the Smolles on 16 August 2001, which sought to exclude certain transaction costs in relation to the switch from the balanced trust to the Bond. Reynolds Lawyers' letter of 11 March 2002 stated that the variations to the Deed of Release were \\\"unacceptable\\\" to the bank. As finally executed on 25 March 2002, the Deed of Release dealt specifically with the Smolles' claim against the bank for \\\"compensation in relation to\\\" their investment in the balanced trust and the Bond.\\n\\n52 I also indicated, on 18 October 2007, that I would not dismiss the Smolles' claim against Reynolds Lawyers on the basis of want of prosecution, despite the many failures on their part to comply with directions and orders of the Court. In part, I did so in reliance upon the principles laid down by the High Court in State of Queensland v JL Holdings Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 1 ; (1997) 189 CLR 146. The Smolles had been required to pay indemnity costs for each earlier breach of my orders, and that seemed to me to ameliorate to some degree any prejudice that Reynolds Lawyers had suffered. Bearing in mind the difficulties under which the Smolles laboured, having regard to their particular circumstances, and also taking into account the fact that they were now competently represented, I concluded that it would not be appropriate to prevent them from prosecuting their case.\\n\\n53 That leaves the position as follows. The claim against the bank is dismissed. However, Reynolds Lawyers still face claims for failure to carry out instructions, breach of retainer, negligence and misleading or deceptive conduct. Reynolds Lawyers have cross-claimed against the bank, in the event that they are found liable to the Smolles. The status of that cross-claim will need to be considered at some future time.\\n\\n54 On any view, if the Smolles are to succeed against their former solicitors they will have to prove not merely that the breaches alleged occurred, but also that they suffered loss or damage as a consequence.\",\"6\":\"46 More recently in Commonwealth Development Bank of Australia Ltd v Kok, in the matter of Kok [2003] FCA 90 Beaumont J stated (at [34]): \\n \\n \\n \\\"In the first place, it is a settled principle of interpretation that general words in an instrument of release are limited always to that thing, or those things, which were specially in the contemplation of the parties at the time when the release was given\\\". \\n \\n \\n \\n See also Torrens Aloha Pty Ltd v Citibank NA (1997) 72 FCR 581 at 599 600.\"}}"
