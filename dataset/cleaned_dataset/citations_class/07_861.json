The AAT Act provides that such an appeal is to be instituted not later than 28 days after \\\"a document setting out the terms of the decision of the Tribunal is given to the person or within such further time as the [Court] allows\\\": see s 44(2A) of the AAT Act . Where a person makes an application to institute an appeal out of time, the Court will consider the relevant factors, including any explanation the applicant may advance for the delay and the applicant's prospects on the appeal, if leave were granted: see, for example, Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen (1984) 3 FCR 344 at 348-349 per Wilcox J. There may be other matters too, such as the prejudice to the applicant, or the respondent.\\n\\n13 It is not suggested that the respondent would suffer any prejudice by reason of the applicant's delay in instituting the appeal if leave were granted. The Tribunal gave its decision on 10 November 2006 and emailed a copy of the decision to the applicant's accountant the same day. The delay in instituting this application on 11 December 2006 is insignificant. Unsurprisingly, the respondent neither consents to nor opposes the application for an extension of time.\\n\\n14 If there were merit in the appeal, then a refusal to grant leave would plainly prejudice the applicant.\",\"1\":\"18 First, the notice of appeal as presently drafted does not state a ground of appeal that this Court can hear and determine. Under s 44(1) of the AAT Act , the subject matter of an appeal from the Tribunal is the question of law that is raised by the appeal: see Ergon Energy Corporation Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCAFC 125 ; (2006) 153 FCR 551 at 572 per Gyles J (dissenting in the application of the principle) and Comcare v Etheridge [2006] FCAFC 27 ; (2006) 149 FCR 522 at 527 per Branson J.\",\"2\":\"18 First, the notice of appeal as presently drafted does not state a ground of appeal that this Court can hear and determine.

Section 37 of the SGA Act does provide for the amendment of assessments but it was not suggested, and the circumstances do not indicate, that the power to amend might properly have been exercised in the case of the applicant. As the Tribunal noted, there would appear to be no legislative provision that would accord a decision-maker the power to remit all or part of the SGC, or nominal interest and administrative component: see, in this regard, the discussions in Re Jarra Hills Pty Ltd and the Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1997) 37 ATR 1022; Re Truelove and the Commissioner of Taxation [2000] AATA 276 ; Re Kancroft (acting as trustee for the Roberson Family Trust) and Commissioner of Taxation [2004] AATA 113 ; Iwec Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] AATA 1051 ; and Victorian Patient Transport Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] AATA 1239.

It seems to me, therefore, that not only is the draft notice of appeal fundamentally defective, but any possible appeal has little prospect of success.\",\"4\":\"31 Moreover, even if the applicant were able to formulate a question of law raising the issues considered by the Tribunal in this case, it is unlikely that error would be shown in the Tribunal's decision.

Recently, Bennett J commented in Cytel Pty Ltd v Peoplebank Recruitment Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 985 at [6] that such discretion must be exercised judicially according to the requirements of justice and in favour of the company where sufficient reason is demonstrated.\\n\\n36 I accept that, as the respondent argued, Mr Bellin produced very little evidence in support of his application to represent the applicant. In other circumstances, this would be reason enough to decline the leave that has been sought. It would appear, however, that a controller has been appointed to the applicant. Given the nature of the application and the particular circumstances of the case, including Mr Bellin's familiarity with the matter, I would grant Mr Bellin the leave he seeks solely for the purposes of my hearing and determining this application.\\n I certify that the preceding thirty-six (36) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Kenny. \\n\\n\\n Associate:\\n\\nDated: 5 June 2007\\n\\n\\n Counsel for the Applicant: The applicant was represented by its director, Mr H.
