Crennan J dismissed the claim, holding that Disney's use of the words was not use as a trade mark: Christodoulou v Disney Enterprises Inc [2005] FCA 1401.\",\"1\":\"2 Mr Christodoulou appealed. On Disney's application, Merkel J made an order for security for costs in the amount of $10,000: Christodoulou v Disney Enterprises Inc [2006] FCA 38. Mr Christodoulou duly paid that amount into court.\\n\\n3 On 30 May 2006 Mr Christodoulou filed a notice of motion (the first motion) seeking orders that he \\\"be permitted to discontinue\\\" the appeal and that the $10,000 be returned to him. On the same day he filed a document headed \\\"Notice of Discontinuance Order 22 rule 2\\\" which stated that he \\\"pursuant to the leave of the Court granted on 31 May 2006 [the return date of the first motion] (if leave is obtained) discontinues\\\" the appeal.\\n\\n4 If a notice of discontinuance is filed by an appellant before the hearing of the appeal, no leave is needed. The appeal is taken to be abandoned and the appellant becomes liable to pay the respondent's costs: Federal Court Rules O 52 r 19 (O 22 r 2 referred to in Mr Christodoulou's document applies to discontinuance of proceedings at first instance, not appeals). However, the Court would have a broad discretion, arising from s 43(2) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), to make some other order as to costs.\",\"2\":\"11 Mr Bova also submitted that I should conclude that the Court had no power to set aside the notice of discontinuance because Mr Christodoulou had not satisfied either of the two possibly applicable criteria. The first requires it to be shown that the withdrawal is a nullity; the Court needs to be satisfied the discontinuance was not the result of a deliberate and informed decision such as where (to take some non-exhaustive examples) it is the result of fraud or mistake: R v Medway [1976] 1 All ER 527 at 543. The second, more liberal, view is that the Court has power to set aside the discontinuance as part of its inherent power to prevent injustice: Applicant NACT of 2001 v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 316 at [4] , Applicant A26 of 2002 v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 1050 at [5] .\",\"3\":\"11 Mr Bova also submitted that I should conclude that the Court had no power to set aside the notice of discontinuance because Mr Christodoulou had not satisfied either of the two possibly applicable criteria.

In NACT (supra) Jacobson J, as already mentioned, held that there was power in the Court to set aside the notice of discontinuance, but dismissed the application. However, the question whether the jurisdiction could be exercised by a single judge was not raised before his Honour and was not mentioned.\\n\\n15 In NACU v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1444 the appellant was the wife of the appellant in NACT . In the husband's case an application for special leave to appeal to the High Court had taken the point that the application should have been heard by a Full Court. In NACU Hill J at [8] expressed \\\"some misgivings\\\" about jurisdiction, but apparently on the basis that following a discontinuance the proceedings were at an end and there is nothing that could go before a Full Court. If there was power to set aside a discontinuance, to his Honour it was \\\"not immediately apparent how the application (was) one that really resides in the Full Court\\\". If it did, his Honour did not think that s 25 would permit the Full Court jurisdiction to be exercised by a single judge. In any event, his Honour decided to follow Jacobson J, partly because the husband was seeking special leave from the High Court and that the two cases \\\"should be kept together\\\" (at [10]).\",\"4\":\"11 Mr Bova also submitted that I should conclude that the Court had no power to set aside the notice of discontinuance because Mr Christodoulou had not satisfied either of the two possibly applicable criteria.
