In the course of his reasons granting approval of the proposed pooling Goldberg J said: \\n \\n \\n \\\"the pooling proposal by the Administrators is sensible and advantageous to most of the creditors from a practical point of view.\\\" (Administrators' Seventh Report to Creditors, 31 March 2007, p 22)\\n\\n9 The significance of pooling for present purposes is that an award of costs against the applicant would be recoverable from all the assets of the Ansett Group, and not just the assets of the applicant.

His Honour was there concerned with an application for costs against an administrator under a deed of company arrangement. The administrator was a party and in the substantive proceeding had been removed by order of his Honour on the basis of findings of impropriety and negligence in the conduct of the administration. Because the office of company administrator was comparatively new, and not the subject of any costs jurisprudence, his Honour reviewed a number of analogous situations.\\n\\n20 Under the heading \\\"Personal costs orders against administrators\\\", Austin J discussed a number of scenarios commencing with that identified by the sub-heading \\\"Where the company under a deed of company arrangement is a party to the proceedings, but the administrator is not, and the company is unsuccessful\\\" ([24]-[35]). That of course is the hypothesis on which the present application is brought.\\n\\n23 C resvale does not assist in the present case. The applicant company has not been shown to have insufficient funds to meet the costs of a successful opposing party.\",\"2\":\"21 His Honour said at [25]: \\n \\n \\n \\\"Clearly costs may be awarded against the company under administration, but the company may have insufficient funds to meet the costs of the successful party. In the normal case, the litigation will have been conducted on behalf of the company by the administrator. The question arises whether the court may order the administrator personally to pay the successful party's costs, although the administrator is not a party to the proceedings.\\\" \\n \\n \\n \\n His Honour then goes on to discuss Knight and points out that subsequent amendments to the New South Wales Supreme Court Rules have abolished some of the traditional categories of grounds for an order costs against non-parties referred to in that case: at [27], citing Wentworth v Wentworth [2000] NSWCA 350 at [162] . (There are no equivalent provisions in Order 28 of the Federal Court Rules .) He concludes at [32] that the New South Wales Rules would prevent a court in that State from awarding costs against an administrator who is not a party to the proceedings.\",\"3\":\"25 In the event of the respondents' application being dismissed, the applicant seeks costs on an indemnity basis. One established ground for such an order is that an application has been commenced or continued in circumstances where the losing party (in the present case the respondents seeking an order for security for costs), properly advised, should have known that there was no chance of success: Fountain Selected Meats (Sales) Pty Ltd v International Produce Merchants Pty Ltd (1988) 81 ALR 397 at 401, Ragat Developments Pty Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation (1993) 217 ALR 175 at 177.\",\"4\":\"6 Thus the threshold requirement, which the respondents must establish, is that there is reason to believe that the applicant will be unable to pay the respondents' costs if they are successful. In the words of von Doussa J in Beach Petroleum NL v Johnson (1992) 7 ACSR 203 at 205:\\n \\\" ... the power of the court under s 1335 arises if credible evidence establishes that there is reason to believe there is a real chance that in events which can fairly be described as reasonably possible the plaintiff corporation will be unable to pay the costs of the defendant on service of the allocatur, if judgment goes against it. This will be so even if in other events which can also be fairly described as reasonably possible the plaintiff corporation would be able to pay the costs.\\\"\",\"5\":\"17 Mr Campbell SC for the respondents referred to Knight v F P Special Assets Ltd [1992] HCA 28 ; (1992) 174 CLR 178. The High Court there held that the Supreme Court of Queensland had jurisdiction to award costs against non-parties, in that instance receivers and managers of insolvent companies which had brought unsuccessful proceedings. Mason CJ and Deane J at 191 pointed out that the availability of an order for security for costs at an early stage of litigation would be a \\\"strong argument for refusing to exercise a discretion to order costs against a non-party\\\". However, as their Honours went on to point out, that did not deny the existence of a jurisdiction to award costs against non-parties, as distinct from the possible exercise of discretion to refuse such an order.\\n\\n21 His Honour said at [25]: \\n \\n \\n \\\"Clearly costs may be awarded against the company under administration, but the company may have insufficient funds to meet the costs of the successful party.

It is not necessary therefore to say anything about the applicant's submissions as to the substantive merits of the respondents' case or the quantum of the amount of security sought. I would only say that there does seem to be force in the submission of Mr McGowan SC that the respondents are in a real sense the moving party since in their cross-claim they seek removal of the applicant's trade marks, which is something they would have to achieve anyway to obtain registration of their own marks.

In such a case, an order for security for costs against the plaintiff will, as a matter of practicality, require the non-party to provide the security. Failure to make such an application for security for costs at an early stage may, as a matter of discretion, tell against the later making of such an order against the non-party. In the present case there is no question this Court has jurisdiction to make an order for security for costs against the applicant, which of course is a party; the problem for the respondents is that the statutory pre-condition for such an order has not been established.\"}}"
