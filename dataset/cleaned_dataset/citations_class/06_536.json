If it is suggested that there is a legal consequence, it may be necessary to be more precise as to the nature and quality of the error attributed to the decision-maker, and to identify the legal principle or statutory provision that attracts the suggested consequence.' \\n \\n\\nThe learned Federal Magistrate said, in relation to the third ground, that no such precision had been provided.\\n\\n20 The learned Federal Magistrate found no other possible assertion of jurisdictional error apparent from his own reading of the Tribunal decision and the book of relevant documents.
