The learned Magistrate noted at [5] that there was no dispute about the facts. The dispute concerned the correct interpretation of the relevant terms of the Award. The history of the earlier award would be a matter of fact, provable by evidence.\\n\\n17 The appeal will be allowed and the orders made on 15 October 2007 set aside.
