Section 116(1)(b) provides that the Minister may cancel a visa if satisfied that its holder \\\"has not complied with a condition of the visa\\\". Section 116(3) provides that in such circumstances the Minister must cancel the visa if there exist prescribed circumstances in which a visa must be cancelled. Clause 2.43(2)(b) of the Regulations relevantly provided, prior to 8 October 2005, that for the proposes of s 116(3) the Minister must cancel a Student (Temporary) Class TU visa if satisfied that the visa holder has not complied with condition 8202. Condition 8202(1) requires the visa holder to comply with sub-clause (2). In order to meet the requirements of sub-clause (2) the visa holder must be enrolled in a registered course: see condition 8202(2)(a). That requirement, as with the other requirements in condition 8202, concerns a continuing state of affairs. In effect, the visa holder is not permitted to cease to be enrolled in such a course: Liu v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 1170 at [19] [20].\\n\\n21 There is an inexorable and somewhat remorseless logic to this sequence of statutory requirements. The Minister has no discretion in the matter. The Regulations as they stood prior to 8 October 2005 plainly had the potential to operate unfairly. That was subsequently recognised, and clause 2.43 was amended.\",\"1\":\"22 However, there is clear authority for the proposition that the appellant's case must be considered in the light of the law as it stood at the time of the visa cancellation. Both the delegate's decision and the MRT's decision to affirm that decision took place before the amendments came into effect. The appellant cannot call in aid the ameliorated version of the clause because it has no retrospective effect. See the decision of the Full Court in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Zhou [2006] FCAFC 96 ; (2006) 152 FCR 115 at [44] per Ryan, Nicholson and Lander JJ. See also Liyanage v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1489 per Marshall J.\",\"2\":\"22 However, there is clear authority for the proposition that the appellant's case must be considered in the light of the law as it stood at the time of the visa cancellation.

In the end, however, it seems to me to be unnecessary to determine that question. If this matter were remitted, the MRT would, on the authority of Zhou , still be required to consider his case on the basis of the Regulations as they stood prior to 8 October 2005.\\n\\n24 Ms Welshman submitted that new material might be placed before the MRT which might lead it to conclude that the appellant had not ceased to be enrolled at St Augustine's College as from 31 March 2005. She submitted that it might be possible to attack the process by which the school arrived at its decision to terminate his enrolment.\\n\\n25 That submission seems to me to have an air of unreality. This case has always proceeded upon the assumption that the appellant's enrolment at St Augustine's College came to an end as at 31 March 2005. I cannot conceive of any circumstances in which the MRT would, or could, arrive at any different conclusion. It follows that if this matter were remitted, the ultimate result of any reconsideration would inevitably be that the delegate's decision would be affirmed.\",\"3\":\"18 The appellant requires leave to raise new grounds that were not argued before his Honour. The Minister opposes such leave on the basis that it is not expedient in the interests of justice that leave be granted. He submits that the new grounds have no reasonable prospects of success: NAJT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 134 ; (2005) 147 FCR 51 per Madgwick J (with whom Conti J agreed) at [162] [175].\",\"4\":\"26 Futility is a well recognised basis upon which a Court will decline to grant judicial review: see SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 at [29] . In such circumstances relief is refused because the applicant has in fact suffered no injustice since the statutory law compels a particular outcome.\\n\\n27 Had any of the grounds of appeal that are now sought to be agitated before me been raised before the Federal Magistrate his Honour would undoubtedly have rejected the application for judicial review. That is because it would have been futile to grant the relief sought.\\n\\n28 There is no basis upon which to grant leave to permit the new grounds to be argued. It would be futile to grant such leave. It also follows that no appealable error can be demonstrated in relation to his Honour's decision to dismiss the application for judicial review.\\n\\n29 The appeal must be dismissed with costs. \\n\\n I certify that the preceding twenty-nine (29) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Weinberg. \\n\\n\\n Associate:\\n\\nDated: 8 August 2007\\n\\n\\n Counsel for the Appellant: Ms K Welshman \\n \\n Counsel for the First Respondent: Mr S Free \\n \\n Solicitor for the Respondent: Clayton Utz \\n \\n Date of Hearing: 8 August 2007 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 8 August 2007 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2007\\/1188.html\",\"5\":\"19 It is unnecessary to refer to the many cases which say that where there is no adequate explanation for the failure to take a point before the primary judge, and the point seems to be of doubtful merit, leave should ordinarily be refused. See, however, VUAX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 158 at [48] . The real question, so far as leave is concerned, is whether any of the grounds sought to be raised has a reasonable prospect of success. That question cannot be determined without also considering the related issue of whether it would be futile to remit this matter to the MRT for reconsideration.\"}}"
