"{\"id\":{\"0\":\"c0\"},\"class\":{\"0\":\"applied\"},\"tocase\":{\"0\":\"Glew v Harrowell of Hunt & Hunt Lawyers [2003] FCA 373 ; (2003) 198 ALR 331\"},\"text\":{\"0\":\"8 In the affidavit sworn by the applicant on 11 September 2008 and filed in support of his Application, the sole ground relied upon by the applicant for setting aside the Bankruptcy Notice was that he had a \\\" counter-claim, set off or cross demand equal to or exceeding the amount in the Bankruptcy Notice \\\" which he could not have set up in the original proceedings. The \\\" original proceedings \\\" in the present case are the Common Law proceedings in the Supreme Court of New South Wales in which the judgment for $4,794.75 was obtained (see Glew v Harrowell of Hunt & Hunt Lawyers [2003] FCA 373 ; (2003) 198 ALR 331 at [3] (p 332)).\\n\\n9 In handwriting, in par 2 of the applicant's affidavit, the applicant set out the following particulars of that ground: \\n Pinata Pty Ltd paid William James Hamilton an amount of $28000 for conducting its Administration and amount of over $25000 in 1996 for a progress payment to him as a Joint Receiver of the Pinata Pty Ltd and Partners Partnership under a Deed of Dissolution and Appointment of Receivers in which William James Hamilton should be disentitled to receive no remuneration because of his acts of wilful neglect and wilful default under Ch 6.3 of the Deed of Dissolution and Appointment of Receivers. Further details of the acts of wilful neglect and wilful default are set out in the accompanying Notice of Motion filed in the Supreme Court of NSW Equity Division on 1 Aug 06 and its annexed affidavit which is attached or accompanying this Notice to Respondent.\\n\\n10 The applicant attached to his affidavit a copy of the Notice of Motion referred to in par 2 of his affidavit, being a Notice of Motion filed by him on 1 August 2006 in Supreme Court Proceedings No 3346 of 2001 between Pinata Pty Limited, as plaintiff, and the present respondent, as first defendant (\\\" the Supreme Court proceedings \\\"). The other defendant parties to the Supreme Court proceedings, in the order in which they were named in those proceedings, were:\\n \\nRobert Peter Leigo\\n \\nYvonne Lesley Leigo\\n \\nGeoffrey Naunton Davies\\n \\nKerrie Joy Davies\\n \\nNeill Robert Leigo\\n \\nBryce Geoffrey Lyle Killen (the present applicant)\\n\\n30 Subsection 40(1)(g) of the Act has been considered in many authorities over the years. A useful summary of the relevant principles is found in the judgment of Lindgren J in Glew [2003] FCA 373 ; 198 ALR 331 at [8] to [12] (333 334). I will not set out in these Reasons for Judgment what his Honour said in those paragraphs but I do accept the statements made by his Honour as correct statements of principle and I propose to apply them in the present case.\\n\\n31 Before doing so, I will rule on the admissibility of the material tendered by the applicant.\\n\\n32 Many objections were taken to the material on behalf of the respondent. I should say that most of the objections were well taken. Some concerned the fragmented nature of the material. Some were objections as to form and others were taken on the basis that the material was irrelevant. The respondent's Notice of Objections may be found in the Court file.\"}}"
