The question whether a representation made by a person to the public, or a section of it, would be likely to mislead or deceive must be answered without regard to whether that person intends to mislead or deceive. It is not a question of whether, if the person makes these representations, he or she would be acting honestly and reasonably. It is simply a question of whether potential members of the class to whom the representations are to be addressed (which include the astute and the gullible, the intelligent and the not so intelligent, and the well educated and the poorly educated) are at serious risk of being misled or deceived: see .au Domain Administration Ltd v Domain Names Australia Pty Ltd (2004) 207 ALR 521 at [12] [15] and National Exchange Pty Ltd v ASIC (2004) 49 ACSR 369.\",\"1\":\"19 In Australian Society of Accountants v Federation of Australian Accountants Inc (1987) 9 IPR 282, a body calling itself the \\\"Federation of Australian Accountants\\\" had published advertisements in the Australian Financial Review newspaper stating:\\n \\\"(FAA Coat of Arms) \\n \\n The Federation of Australian Accountants wish to invite suitably qualified accountants to join our federation. We are currently running examinations to increase your status to C.P.A. Any accountant who wishes to do so with our federation is encouraged to inquire. Any accountant that becomes a C.P.A. with our federation will be allowed to use our logos for advertising purposes. \\n \\n Federation of Australian Accountants Inc Box 87, GPO Adelaide 5001.\\\" \\n \\n \\n\\nHaving regard to the issues raised in the present case, it is worth noting that the decision does not make clear whether the respondent Federation intended its members to be referred to as Certified Practising Accountants or Certified Public Accountants.\\n\\n20 CPA Australia, which at that time was the Australian Society of Accountants, sought injunctive relief. In granting that relief, Woodward J stated (at 285 286):\\n \\n \\\"Having studied the affidavits, and considered counsel's arguments, I am left in no doubt that, over the last three years, the applicant has gone to great trouble and expense -- to the tune of over $3 million -- to establish the status of its qualification of Certified Practising Accountant or CPA. I am satisfied that, even in that comparatively short space of time, it has built up a substantial reputation in the accountancy profession and in the general community for that qualification. The expression \\\"Certified Practising Accountant\\\" was apparently unknown in Australia before the applicant began its campaign, and there is no evidence to suggest that it is used in any other English-speaking country. It seems that the expression \\\"Certified Public Accountant\\\" has currency in the United States, but there is no evidence before me to indicate how widespread its usage is or just what status it conveys. \\n \\n The applicant is a large professional organisation of accountants, having some 53,000 members. Its antecedent bodies date back to 1887. It charges its members an annual subscription of $214, spends some $17 million each year on its professional objects, and employs 160 people. It is, in short, a very large and reputable professional body, which recruits some 2500 new members each year -- over 70 percent of those who graduate in accountancy from tertiary institutions. Along with the Institute of Chartered Accountants, it has provided the only regulation of the profession in most states of Australia over a number of years.\\\"\\n\\n21 Having made those findings, Woodward J further accepted (at 286) that: \\n \\n \\\"... the opening paragraph of the advertisement is likely to mislead students, and other persons wishing to obtain accountancy qualifications, into believing they can obtain the applicant's CPA qualification, or its equivalent, from the respondent federation. Users of accountancy services may also be misled into thinking that the federation is in some way connected with the applicant, or that any organisation can award such a qualification, thus devaluing it in the eyes of such potential clients.\\\"\\n\\n23 Woodward J granted the injunctions sought, including orders that the respondents be restrained not only from publishing the advertisement in question, but also: \\n \\n \\\"from representing by any other means that the firstnamed respondent is entitled to confer CPA (Certified Practising Accountant) status on members of the firstnamed respondent;\\\" \\n \\n\\n(For the relevant orders, see the unreported version: Australian Society of Accountants v Federation of Australian Accountants Inc [1987] FCA 298.)\\n\\n31 In Australian Society of Accountants v Federation of Australian Accountants Inc Woodward J reached precisely the same conclusion regarding the words \\\"Certified Practising Accountant\\\". His Honour's decision was upheld by a Full Court. Of course, that decision turned on a question of fact in a case involving only one of the two parties before me. However, it is fair to say that his Honour reached that view on the basis of only three years of promotion of the designation \\\"Certified Practising Accountant\\\". The evidence before me is much stronger. The term has now been used for more than twenty-three years, and as previously indicated has found its way into both State and Commonwealth legislation.\\n\\n32 For these reasons, Mr Dunn's argument that the word \\\"certified\\\" means nothing more than \\\"qualified\\\", and that as he has a degree in accounting, and practises as an accountant, he is entitled with impunity to describe himself as a \\\"Certified Practising Accountant\\\", must fail. The term has a distinct secondary meaning, and as a consequence Mr Dunn's use of it would be likely to mislead or deceive.\\n\\n33 Mr Dunn's argument fails at other points as well. Though he has a degree, one would not normally describe the University that granted it to him as having \\\"certified\\\" him as a practising accountant. The reason is plain. Many graduates in accounting do not go on to practise in that field.\",\"2\":\"27 It is clear that regard must be had to the relevant conduct as a whole, and in context.

Lockhart J with whom Northrop J agreed) described, and dismissed, the central argument raised by the Federation on appeal in these terms (at 10 11):\\n \\n \\\"The principal argument on the appeal was that the absence from the advertisement of a stated and specific link between the initials \\\"CPA\\\" and the Society was fatal to the Society's case, and that his Honour's findings to the contrary were erroneous. \\n \\n ... \\n \\n The point which resolves the central issues in this appeal is that the letters CPA have plainly acquired a special and distinctive meaning in relation to the accountancy profession in Australia. It is plain that the opening paragraph of the advertisement is likely to mislead students and others wishing to obtain accountancy qualifications into believing that they can obtain the Society's CPA qualification from the Federation.\\\"\",\"8\":\"26 The principles which govern s 52 are well established. When determining whether particular conduct was, or is, likely to mislead or deceive it is unnecessary to prove that anyone was actually misled or deceived: Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 44 ; (1982) 149 CLR 191 at 198. However, evidence that particular individuals have been misled or deceived is admissible, and may be persuasive: Global Sportsman Pty Ltd v Mirror Newspapers Pty Ltd (1984) 2 FCR 82 at 87. The test is objective, and the Court must determine the question for itself: Taco Company Australia Inc v Taco Bell Pty Ltd (1982) 42 ALR 177 at 202. Finally, conduct is likely to mislead or deceive if there is a real and not remote possibility that it will do so. It is not necessary to establish that the degree of likelihood exceeds 50%: Global Sportsman at 87.\",\"9\":\"36 Much the same can be said about Mr Dunn's use of the phrase \\\"Certified Public Accountant\\\". That term closely resembles the designation \\\"Certified Practising Accountant\\\". The visual and aural similarities are real. It is clearly established that the use of different but similar words and phrases can constitute misleading or deceptive conduct. For example, in Mobileworld Communications Pty Ltd v Q & Q Global Enterprise (2003) 61 IPR 98 the Court was concerned with the use by one business of the name \\\"Crazy Ron's\\\". Allsop J held that that name was misleading or deceptive because of its similarity to the pre-established trade name \\\"Crazy John's\\\". His Honour further concluded that disclaimers would not be sufficient, and that injunctive relief was appropriate.\\n\\n37 Finally, the use of the term \\\"Certified Public Accountant\\\" would be likely to mislead because it suggests that there is some organisation that awards that qualification, and that Mr Dunn has satisfied the requirements of that organisation in order to acquire that status. In fact, the evidence reveals that there is no such organisation. Mr Dunn has not undertaken any continuing education of the kind that the applicant requires in order to grant certification, and he has not undertaken any examinations which are a prerequisite to the designation in question. He may be a public accountant holding tertiary qualifications. However, he is not a \\\"Certified Public Accountant\\\" because no professional body or organisation has conferred that title upon him.\\n\\n38 In my opinion, the applicant is entitled to the injunctive relief sought under s 80 of the Trade Practices Act . Mr Dunn acknowledged in his final submissions that, unless restrained, he will use one or other of the expressions \\\"Certified Practising Accountant\\\" or \\\"Certified Public Accountant\\\" in his letterhead. That would amount to a contravention of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act , and the applicant is entitled to prevent that from occurring.\",\"10\":\"27 It is clear that regard must be had to the relevant conduct as a whole, and in context.

In the same way, a statement may contain a representation that is implied, rather than express. That is why a statement that is literally true can be misleading or deceptive: National Exchange at [48] [52].\",\"11\":\"40 Mr Dunn submitted that, even if an injunction were granted, he should not be required to pay the applicant's costs. His longstanding dispute with the applicant regarding its rights to describe its members in the way that it does reflects a genuinely felt sense of grievance on his part. In some respects, he might be regarded as a \\\"stirrer\\\". To paraphrase the remarks of Murphy J in Neal v The Queen [1982] HCA 55 ; (1982) 149 CLR 305 at 316 317, Mr Dunn is entitled to be a stirrer. He is not, however, entitled to exemption from the ordinary rules that govern proceedings in this Court.

I am satisfied, on the evidence, that those of the applicant's members who have been accorded the qualification of \\\"Certified Practising Accountant\\\" have acquired a reputation through that designation. I accept the applicant's submission that the combination of those three words have a secondary meaning, namely that a person who has that designation has obtained \\\"membership of [the applicant] which, by its tests and examinations and by its rules and requirements as to qualification, confer[s] on its members a status different from that of other members of the profession\\\" who do not have the same qualification: Society of Accountants and Auditors v Goodway and London Association of Accountants Ltd at 500.\",\"15\":\"26 The principles which govern s 52 are well established.
