Such principle has been applied to proceedings under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth): see Yates v Wilson and Others at 339, where Mason CJ said: \\n \\n 'The undesirability of fragmenting the criminal process is so powerful a consideration that it requires no elaboration by us. It is a factor that should inhibit the Federal Court from exercising jurisdiction under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 ...' \\n \\n\\n It has also been applied to extradition proceedings: see Wiest v Director of Public Prosecutions and Another (1988) 81 ALR 129 at 130-131; Peniche v Hannan ; Harris . In Harris the Full Court said at page 413:\\n \\n 'Whilst the present application was made under the Judiciary Act rather than the AD(JR) Act, the foregoing considerations suggest that, as Davies J pointed out in Wiest v Director of Public Prosecutions (1988) 81 ALR 129 (at 130-131)) there are sound reasons of policy why the Court should be reluctant to intervene at an intermediate stage of the extradition process, in the absence of an exceptional situation, for instance the determination of a discrete point of law on uncontested facts (cf Elliott v Seymour (1993) 68 ALJR 173 per Gaudron J at 175; Jarrett v Seymour (1993) 46 FCR 557 per Lockhart and Beaumont JJ at 565-467.'\\n\\nDragan submitted that it would be more convenient for the Issues to be determined separately to the magistrate's hearing. However, in Elliott v Seymour and Others Gaudron J at 4 said: \\n \\n '... an order preventing the institution of criminal proceedings would only be made in exceptional cases and, as will later appear, the matters which would make a case exceptional would, almost inevitably, outweigh considerations of convenience.' \\n\\nA finding to the same effect was made by the Full Court in Jarrett v Seymour and Others (1993) 119 ALR 46 at 54 where it said:\\n \\n 'As the primary judge recognised, it is well settled that an exceptional case must be made out in order that this court should intervene in the criminal process, by way of judicial review.'\\n\\nThere is no reason to depart from these principles which apply with equal force to extradition proceedings. Contrary to Dragan's submission, the Court is satisfied that a hearing of the issues prior to the magistrates decision, would offend the anti-fragmentation principle.\\n\\nFor the above reasons, this Court is satisfied that its discretion should be exercised against determining the Issues, and the Court will adjourn Dragan's application to this Court. In reaching this decision the Court makes no finding upon the merits of Dragan's submissions.\",\"1\":\"The Minister also submits that in accordance with established authority, the Court, in the exercise of its discretion, should not permit the fragmentation of the criminal process by determining the Issues pending the magistrate's hearing. The Minister relies upon several authorities including Harris v Attorney-General of the Commonwealth and Another (1994) 52 FCR 386; Peniche v Hannan [1999] FCA 915 ; Yates v Wilson and Others (1989) 168 CLR 338; Forsyth v United Kingdom [2003] FCA 1084 , and submits that they demonstrate a strong presumption against interference with the statutory extradition process.\\n\\nIt is an established principle that this Court usually will not interfere with the exercise of a discretion to prosecute: see Newby v Moodie and Another (1987) 78 ALR 603 at 606-607; Elliott v Seymour and Others [1993] HCA 70 ; (1993) 119 ALR 1 at 4. Such principle has been applied to proceedings under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth): see Yates v Wilson and Others at 339, where Mason CJ said: \\n \\n 'The undesirability of fragmenting the criminal process is so powerful a consideration that it requires no elaboration by us.

The Minister relies upon Metwally v University of Wollongong [1985] HCA 28 ; (1985) 60 ALR 68 in support of the submission that Dragan's application should be refused on this discretionary ground.\\n\\nDragan opposes the adjournment and submits that a determination of the Issues prior to the magistrate's hearing would decide whether the Geneva Conventions operate to the exclusion of the Regulations. Such determination would resolve the question of Dragan's eligibility for surrender.\\n\\nIn response to the Minister's submission that the Issues could have been brought in the High Court proceedings, Dragan submits that the Minister could have raised such questions, and submits that the principle in Metwally has no application. Dragan relies upon Regina v Governor of Brixton Prison; Ex parte Osmon (No. 3) [1992] 1 WLR 36 at 43 as authority for the principle that the raising of a new legal argument late in proceedings for habeas corpus does not amount to an abuse of process.\\n\\nDragan's claim for relief arises pursuant to the Act. Accordingly, this Court has jurisdiction to entertain the claim for relief under s 39B(1A)(c) of the Judiciary Act (1903) (Cth). The essential question is whether such jurisdiction should, in the Court's discretion, be exercised.\\n\\nPart II of the Act establishes the procedure to be followed when an application for extradition has been made. It commences with the issue of a provisional arrest warrant (s 12(1)), the remand before a magistrate before execution of the warrant (s 15); the issue of the notice by the Attorney-General pursuant to s 16(1); the determination of eligibility for surrender as provided by s 19(1). A party wishing to challenge the magistrate's decision is entitled to seek judicial review as provided by s 21 of the Act.\\n\\nSince the Court has already determined to grant the adjournment sought, it is not necessary to deal with the submission of the Minister based on Metwally . \\n\\n\\n I certify that the preceding thirty-four (34) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Cowdroy. \\n\\n\\n Associate:\\n\\nDated: 13 October 2006\\n\\n\\n Counsel for the Applicant: Brad Slowgrove \\n \\n Solicitor for the Applicant: Dennis & Company Solicitors \\n \\n Counsel for the Respondent: James Renwick \\n \\n Solicitor for the Respondent: Clayton Utz \\n \\n Date of Hearing: 5 October 2006 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 13 October 2006 \\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2006\\/1346.html\"}}"
