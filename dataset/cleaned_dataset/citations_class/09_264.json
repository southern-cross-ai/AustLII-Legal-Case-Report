Accordingly, it is for this reason that I am prepared to exercise my discretion in favour of Ms George and order a stay of the orders of his Honour of 9 February 2009 numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9 and 10 pending delivery of judgment in Ms George's appeal. I am not prepared to make an Order in the terms sought by Ms George in para 2 of her amended Notice of Motion as has been observed by both Dowsett J and myself during the course of these proceedings, if there is an error in the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court it is for the Federal Court to review on appeal.\\n\\nFurther, as I indicated to the parties at the hearing before me, I am not prepared to make the orders sought by Ms George in paras 4, 5, 6 and 7 of her amended Notice of Motion before me (TS 5 March 2009 86 ll 28-30). Instead, the hearing of those paragraphs is adjourned to a date to be fixed.\\n\\nFinally, I do not consider that it is appropriate that I make an Order in the terms sought by Ms George in para 3 of her amended Notice of Motion, being an order by which she apparently seeks recognition of her reliance on certain material and on Supreme Court Orders. Nor do I consider it either appropriate or desirable that I should make an order in the terms sought by Ms George in para 8 of her amended Notice of Motion, being referable to proceedings in the Supreme Court of Queensland.\\n I certify that the preceding nineteen (19) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Collier. \\n \\n Associate:\\n \\n \\nDated: 25 March 2009\\n \\n Solicitor for the Appellant: The Appellant appeared in person \\n \\n Counsel for the First Respondent: Mr K Kelso \\n \\n Solicitor for the First Respondent: Holman Webb \\n \\n Counsel for the Second and Third Respondents: Mr R Galloway \\n \\n Solicitor for the Fourth Respondent: E Abernethy of Thynne & Macartney \\n \\n Solicitor for the Fifth Respondent: The Respondent was given leave not to appear \\n Date of Hearing: 10 March 2009 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 25 March 2009 \\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2009\\/264.html\",\"1\":\"\",\"2\":\"An appeal from orders of a Federal Magistrate pursuant to s 17A Federal Magistrates Act 1999 (Cth), being a summary judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court (cf observations of Buchanan J in Croker v Commonwealth of Australia [2007] FCA 1593) , requires leave of this Court pursuant to s 24(1A) Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).\\n\\nIn the amended notice of motion the applicant seeks the following orders: Under Federal Court Act 1976 s 29(1) request a stay on court orders dated 9 February 2009 numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10 pending the outcome of the Supreme Court matter file number 3747\\/2008.\\n Request a stay on hearing the notice of appeal dated 18 February 2009 pending the outcome of the Supreme Court matter file number 3747\\/2008.\\n The appellant relies upon affidavits dated 5 March 2009, 14 February 2009 in the name of Lauren Kay George for the above matter and Supreme Court Orders dated 18 February 2009 and transcripts dated 9 February 2009 and 18 February 2009.\\n The appellant makes application to the court under ss 303 , 29 , 178 , 30 (1)(a)(b), 149 (4), 149J of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 .\\n\\nThe appellant be deemed to have been discharged from bankruptcy on 25 February 2009 under s 149(4) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 .\",\"3\":\"Issues relevant to the exercise of discretion by the Court in granting leave to appeal are: whether the judgment the subject of the appeal was attended by sufficient doubt to warrant it being reconsidered; and whether substantial injustice would result if leave were refused, supposing the decision to be wrong. \\n( D&eacute;cor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc [1991] FCA 655 ; (1991) 33 FCR 397 , at 398 399, Telstra Corporation Ltd v AAPT Ltd [1997] 38 IPR 539 at 542, Harrington v Rich [2008] FCAFC 61 at [25] .)\",\"4\":\"In the application Ms George seeks leave to appeal from the judgment of a Federal Magistrate of 9 February 2009 and his Honour's Orders 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9 and 10 ( Fletcher v George & Ors (No 6) [2009] FMCA 69).
