There is a detailed examination of this topic by Sheppard J in Bank of New South Wales v Withers (1981) 35 ALR 21. According to that analysis, at common law, a person required to attend by subpoena was entitled to his costs and charges of attendance and, if a professional witness, some indemnity for his loss of time. The first statute allowing such expenses was 5 Eliz 1562, c 9 which, by s 12 , provided that a person served with a subpoena should have paid to him \\\"such reasonable sums of money for his or their costs and charges, as having regard to the distance of the places necessary to be allowed in that behalf\\\". Thereafter all superior courts adopted scales that set out the \\\"reasonable costs and expenses\\\" to which a witness was entitled. The scale was set by the judges. Sheppard J's analysis led him to conclude that the witness was only entitled to receive the amount provided for in the scale of fees for witnesses. He said (35 ALR at 38) that \\\"unless the payment is provided for in the rules there can be no recovery\\\".\\n\\n5 Following the decision in Bank of New South Wales v Withers , O 27 r 4A was introduced. This provides that when a person named in the subpoena is not a party to the proceeding and incurs expense in compliance with a subpoena, the court may order the party who issued the subpoena to pay an amount to compensate the person \\\"for such expense or loss as is reasonably incurred or lost by that person in complying with the subpoena\\\". Similar rules were introduced in all states and territories, other than Queensland, Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory, to deal with what would otherwise have been an unsatisfactory state of affairs.\\n\\n6 The views of Sheppard J have not withstood the test of time. The most powerful attack came in Danieletto v Khera (1995) 35 NSWLR 684. In that case Bryson J rejected the idea that the entitlement of witnesses to be reimbursed for their costs and expenses could be established by reference to conflicting decisions from long ago affected by a Tudor statute long since repealed. He said (35 NSWLR at 688) that the matter should be approached as one of principle and, according to principle it \\\"is a necessary incident of the exercise by the court of its subpoena power that the court should deal with the question of paying persons whose time and attention are involved in the exercise\\\". That is, the court has an inherent jurisdiction to award in favour of a witness such costs as it thinks appropriate to compensate the witness for his time and expenses incurred in compliance with a subpoena. Thus it has been said, correctly in my opinion, that the rules that fix costs for witnesses \\\"represent[s] but an aspect of the more comprehensive jurisdiction in respect of persons subjected to compulsion by the processes of the Court in proceedings to which they are not parties\\\": Re Pan Pharmaceuticals Ltd; Selim v McGrath (2004) 48 ACSR 681, 690 per Barrett J.\",\"2\":\"13 A \\\"solicitor and client\\\" costs order is to be distinguished from an order for taxation on a solicitor and own client basis. On such a taxation all costs are to be allowed, except if they are unreasonably incurred or unreasonable in amount: EMI Records Ltd v Ian Cameron Wallace Ltd [1983] 1 Ch 59, 64. On one view the onus lies on the paying party to show unreasonableness: Kumagai Australia Finance v Avarton Ltd (unreported, Supreme Court of New South Wales, Bryson J, 7 June 1991).

The Registrar's questions assume, I think, that there may be some disconformity between this order and the rules. If there is any disconformity (a matter to which I will return) it is certainly not between the Registrar's order and O 62 r 12(3). That order is concerned only with the expense (formerly \\\"costs and charges\\\") of attending court. That is the only kind of expense that is covered by schedule 2, where the relevant items applying to witnesses are Items 44 to 47 (inclusive). Each item only comes into play if a witness in fact attends court. So much is evident from the description of the item. In this case, of course, Nielsens was not called upon to answer the subpoena with the result that its proper officer did not attend at court. Hence O 62 r 12(3) is irrelevant to the taxation of Nielsens' costs. Nevertheless it is worth noting that if any item of costs falls within any of the four items in schedule 2 relevant to attendances, the taxing officer is required to apply that item ( Fat-Sel Pty Ltd v Brambles Holdings Ltd (1985) 61 ALR 536) unless there is an order of the court to a different effect.\",\"7\":\"9 There is, however, the possibility of disconformity between the Registrar's order and O 27 r 4A.

The usual position in an action where costs are awarded in favour of a party is that they are taxed on a party and party basis. That is a reference to costs that have been reasonably and properly incurred and not the expense which has been actually incurred: A G Saddington Taxation of Costs between Parties (1919), cited in Milosevic v Government Insurance Office of New South Wales (1993) 31 NSWLR 323, 333.\\n\\n11 When costs are ordered to be taxed as between solicitor and client, that usually means one of two different things. If the order is made in an equity case it means that the costs are to be paid on a common fund basis. But costs ordered to be paid on a common fund basis are not determined on a uniform basis. In Daniels Chancery Practice 8th ed at 1018 it was said that when dealing with the taxation of costs on a solicitor and client basis a distinction is to be drawn where the costs were payable out of a fund belonging to the other party, or out of a common fund in which the party entitled to costs had only limited interest, or where the costs were payable out of a fund belonging exclusively to the party himself. The author also noted that if it were intended that the party should be fully indemnified against all expenses the order should say so because an order that merely required the costs to be taxed as between solicitor and client would not achieve that result.\",\"17\":\"7 In any event, since the decision of the High Court in Knight v F P Special Assets Ltd [1992] HCA 28 ; (1992) 174 CLR 178 where it was held that the power to award costs permits a court to award costs against a non-party, the view has been taken that s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) confers a power to award costs in favour of a non-party.
