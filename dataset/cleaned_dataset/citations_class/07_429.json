I have done so because there is an issue as to the proper construction of the order: on construction see Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd, at [19] ff. The ACCC has tendered evidence taken from the phoneflasher website which indicated that (i) on 6 January 2003, the number of retail outlets in Australia listed as having Phoneflashers available for sale, was 157; and (ii) on 3 March 2005, the website listed more than 350 such retail suppliers. Order 4 of the consent orders required the company to provide the ACCC with the required names and address of the retail outlets to which it had provided corrective signs and letters on or before 7 December 2004. No such names were by then provided. Letters informing the respondent of the breach were sent to Phoneflasher Co's solicitors and to Mr Jorgensen.\\n\\n27 An ACCC officer in late December 2004 observed a Phoneflasher display stand in an Adelaide retail centre. On speaking to the manager she was informed that the manager had not received the notice required to be sent in the order.\\n\\n28 On 27 January 2005, a letter from the company's lawyers was received by the lawyer for the ACCC. It enclosed a letter from Mr Kerville of 23 January 2005 which stated that (i) \\\"the company ceased trading over 18 months ago and there are few customers on the books\\\"; (ii) the person \\\"who took over the distribution at that time has also since ceased trading\\\"; and (iii) the ACCC notices had been sent \\\"to prior Phoneflasher customers shown on the attached list\\\". That list contained eight names and addresses.\",\"4\":\"70 Insofar as both of the definitions refer to a person in accordance with whose instructions or wishes the directors are accustomed to act, I should note the following well settled principles:\\n \\n \\n (i) though the purpose of the definition is to identify those persons, other than professional advisers, who have real influence in, or indeed control of, the corporate affairs of a company, it is not necessary that such influence or control should be exercised over the whole field of its corporate activities: Secretary of State of Trade and Industry v Deverell [2001] Ch 340 at 354; and \\n \\n (ii) the influence or control exercised by a shadow director may be strategic in character, defining the context in which, or conditions upon which, the company operates, or else contriving the transactions of significance to the company: Australian Securities Commission v A S Nominees Ltd (1995) 133 ALR 1 at 52-53.\\n \\n \\n\\nSee generally Ho v Akai Pty Ltd (in liq) [2005] FCAFC 265 ; (2006) 24 ACLC 1, 526.\",\"5\":\"70 Insofar as both of the definitions refer to a person in accordance with whose instructions or wishes the directors are accustomed to act, I should note the following well settled principles:\\n \\n \\n (i) though the purpose of the definition is to identify those persons, other than professional advisers, who have real influence in, or indeed control of, the corporate affairs of a company, it is not necessary that such influence or control should be exercised over the whole field of its corporate activities: Secretary of State of Trade and Industry v Deverell [2001] Ch 340 at 354; and \\n \\n (ii) the influence or control exercised by a shadow director may be strategic in character, defining the context in which, or conditions upon which, the company operates, or else contriving the transactions of significance to the company: Australian Securities Commission v A S Nominees Ltd (1995) 133 ALR 1 at 52-53.\\n \\n \\n\\nSee generally Ho v Akai Pty Ltd (in liq) [2005] FCAFC 265 ; (2006) 24 ACLC 1, 526.\\n\\n72 For all practical purposes relating to the principal proceedings (the only known matter of continuing significance to the company), Mr Jorgensen presumed, without apparent let or hindrance of Mr Kerville, to act as the company's mind and will notwithstanding that he was not at the time a person who had been appointed to the position of director.
