I ordered that the application be dismissed, with costs. The respondents foreshadowed at that time that they wished to apply for costs to be awarded on an indemnity basis. I gave directions to facilitate the making of such an application.\\n\\n2 On 19 May 2006, the respondents filed a notice of motion seeking costs on an indemnity basis or, alternatively, on a solicitor\\/client basis. They also sought an order that the applicant pay their costs thrown away (by reason of certain amendments made to the applicant's statement of claim) on an indemnity basis, or alternatively, on a solicitor\\/client basis. I had previously directed that that application be dealt with after the conclusion of the trial.\\n\\n3 There are three separate bases upon which the respondents contend that they are entitled to costs on a higher scale. They say that such costs are warranted because:\\n \\n \\n \\u2022 the applicant conducted the litigation in a manner that was wasteful, causing loss of time and inconvenience to the parties, and to the Court;\\n \\u2022 the proceeding had been commenced or continued in circumstances where the applicant, properly advised, should have known that it had no chance of success; and \\n \\u2022 there was an imprudent refusal of an offer of compromise, essentially contained in what was described as a \\\"Calderbank\\\" letter or letters.\",\"1\":\"13 The principles applicable to an order for costs on an indemnity or solicitor\\/client basis are well-established. The starting point in considering an application for costs on these higher scales is that ordinarily costs are payable on a party\\/party basis. Section 43 of the Federal Court of Australia 1976 (Cth) confers upon the Court a wide discretion in relation to costs. Of course that discretion must be exercised judicially. Indemnity costs may properly be awarded where there is some special or unusual feature in the case justifying a departure from the ordinary rule: Re Wilcox; Ex parte Venture Industries Pty Ltd (No 2) (1996) 72 FCR 151.\",\"2\":\"14 In Colgate-Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Ltd (1993) 46 FCR 225 at 233, Sheppard J provided some examples of the circumstances that might warrant an order for costs on an indemnity basis. The principles are well-known, and need not be elaborated here.\\n\\n15 Dealing first with the contention that the applicant's conduct of this litigation provides a basis for indemnity costs, I am not persuaded by that submission. It is true that the applicant attempted on a number of occasions to reformulate its case against the respondents. The number was less than the 12 that Mr Fitzgerald suggested, but was still significant. Nonetheless, it would be disproportionate and unduly harsh, in my view, to visit indemnity costs upon the applicant in relation to virtually the entire trial because of errors made early on in the conduct of the proceeding.\\n\\n16 Moreover, I do not think that the applicant's failure to give discovery of the letter of 8 January 2002, which was a mistake on its part, and not a deliberate act, warrants such consequences.\",\"3\":\"20 In the first place, there is some doubt as to whether these letters constitute Calderbank offers. There are cases that suggest that an offer by a defendant to settle a case on the basis that each party bears its own costs does not constitute a Calderbank offer: see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd (No 2) (2002) 201 ALR 618 per Hill J; McKerlie v State of New South Wales (No 2) [2000] NSWSC 1159 per Dunford J; Vasram v AMP Life Limited [2002] FCA 1286 per Stone J, Fyna Foods Australia Pty Ltd v Cobannah Holdings Pty Ltd (No 2) [2004] FCA 1212 per Kenny J and Jacomb v The Australian Municipal, Administrative, Clerical and Services Union [2004] FCA 1600 per Crennan J.\",\"4\":\"20 In the first place, there is some doubt as to whether these letters constitute Calderbank offers.

The element of \\\"compromise\\\" involved in the present case was significantly less than the element of compromise that would be involved in a case where each party would bear its own costs.\\n\\n23 In any event, and irrespective of whether the letters qualify as Calderbank offers, I am not persuaded that the applicant acted unreasonably in rejecting those offers. It is by no means clear whether they amounted to a serious compromise of the respondents' rights, as the respondents considered them to be. There is no evidence before me regarding the actual amount expended by the respondents in the defence of this proceeding by March, April or August 2005. I am in no position to gauge whether anything really tangible was being offered to the applicant in return for discontinuing this case. I will not speculate about that issue.\\n\\n24 For these reasons none of the matters identified by Mr Fitzgerald, whether they are considered in isolation, or in conjunction with each other, warrant a departure from the ordinary rule that costs are paid on a party\\/party basis.\\n\\n25 As for the alternative claim that the costs associated with the last amendment to the pleadings be paid on an indemnity basis, that submission must also fail. There is nothing to suggest that the trial of this matter was conducted upon a basis that cast doubt upon the utility of the amendments. The normal rule that costs thrown away by reason of an amendment to the pleadings are paid on a party\\/party basis should apply.\\n\\n26 For these reasons the respondents' notice of motion filed on 19 May 2006 should be dismissed. The respondents must pay the costs of and incidental to that notice of motion.\\n \\n\\n I certify that the preceding twenty-six (26) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice W. \\n\\n\\nAssociate:\\n\\nDated: 15 June 2006\\n\\n\\n Counsel for the Applicant: Mr M.K.
