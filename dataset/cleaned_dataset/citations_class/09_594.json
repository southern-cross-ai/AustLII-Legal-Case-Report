He made no submissions as to why leave should be granted other than to repeat the fact that he invoked O 52 r 10 as was, he said, his right. In applying the test set out for the grant of leave to appeal in D&eacute;cor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc [1991] FCA 655 ; (1991) 33 FCR 397 , I have concluded that neither decision was attended with sufficient doubt to warrant a grant of leave to appeal.\\n\\nFurther, no substantial injustice would be done if leave to appeal were not granted, even assuming that the decisions were wrong.\\n\\nTo the extent that it is relevant, the respondents say that, in each case, if the matters were to go to hearing, the same evidence would be adduced on their part although perhaps in a different form. This, however, is not conclusive of the matter.\",\"1\":\"After I formed the above view and informed the parties, Mr Priestley, in effect, sought leave to reopen his applications for leave to appeal in order to raise further matters as to why leave should be granted.
