They are to be used only for the purpose of the litigation. There is no reason why any further restriction should be placed on use of them by the plaintiff. The plaintiff's conduct of the litigation should not be restricted by confining access to the discovered documents in the way suggested by masking parts said to be irrelevant. The plaintiff, as administrator, should be entitled to inspect the documents, along with his legal advisers and experts.\\n\\n7 It has been necessary for the plaintiff to bring this proceeding and the plaintiff should get the costs of the motion, such costs to be taxed and paid forthwith. \\n\\n I certify that the preceding seven (7) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Heerey. \\n\\n\\n Associate:\\n\\nDated: 28 November 2006\\n\\n\\n Counsel for the Plaintiff: T DiLallo \\n \\n Solicitor for the Plaintiff Russell Kennedy \\n \\n Counsel for the Defendants: P G Lovell \\n \\n Solicitor for the Defendants: Mason Sier Turnball \\n \\n Date of Hearing: 16 November 2006 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 16 November 2006 \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2006\\/1637.html\"}}"
