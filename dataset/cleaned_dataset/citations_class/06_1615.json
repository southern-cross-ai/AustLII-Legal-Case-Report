However, whether it is an appropriate case will depend upon the grounds of review and the circumstances of the case. I refer to the judgment of Weinberg J in Australian Retailers Association v Reserve Bank of Australia [2005] FCA 1707 ; (2005) 148 FCR 446 where at 564, [454] he stated:\\n \\n I accept that, ordinarily, material not before the decision-maker at the time of the making of the decision will not be admissible in proceedings for judicial review.\",\"1\":\"16 It is clear from the Tribunal's reasons for its decision that it found there was insufficient information to enable it to reach a level of satisfaction as to Australia's obligations to the appellant.

In support of his reasoning, his Honour indicated that he was bound to follow the decision of Heerey J in SZCJD v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 609 at [38] - [43] .\\n\\n15 The reason for his Honour's focus upon whether the obligation under s 424A arose at the time that the Tribunal notified the appellant that it was unable to determine the review in his favour on the material before it was that this was how the appellant particularised the breach in his grounds in the amended application. His Honour did not go on to consider whether there was a breach of s 424A at any other time.\",\"4\":\"\",\"5\":\"16 It is clear from the Tribunal's reasons for its decision that it found there was insufficient information to enable it to reach a level of satisfaction as to Australia's obligations to the appellant.
