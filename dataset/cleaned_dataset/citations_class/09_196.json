In essence, a Calderbank offer is one which is made in a proceeding before judgment on the basis of it being without prejudice save as to costs and in which an offer for settlement or resolution of the proceeding is made. The right is reserved to refer to the offer if any issue arises as to costs once judgment is delivered. A court can take the offer into account in determining what costs order should be made notwithstanding that the payment into court procedure provided in the court's rules has not been followed. If the party to whom the offer is made does not obtain a more favourable result than the offer made and it is established that in the circumstances of the case that party ought to have accepted the offer, then costs will be awarded on the same basis as if there had been a payment into Court prior to judgment and judgment for a lesser amount had been obtained.\",\"1\":\"The refusal or rejection of a Calderbank offer, of itself, does not automatically mean, or give rise to a presumption, that the Court should make an order for costs on either a party\\/party basis or (depending on the circumstances) an indemnity basis where the result is less favourable to the offeree than the offer. It must be established that it was unreasonable in all the circumstances for the offeree to reject the offer : Jacomb v Australian Municipal, Administrative, Clerical & Services Union [2004] FCA 1600 at [6] ; Hazeldene's Chicken Farm Pty Ltd v Victorian Workcover Authority (No 2) (2005) 13 VR 435 at 440.\\n\\nThat question gives rise to a threshold issue were the offers genuine offers of compromise?

The usual order for costs is that costs follow the event and are paid on a party\\/party basis unless there are special circumstances which warrant the making of some other order.
