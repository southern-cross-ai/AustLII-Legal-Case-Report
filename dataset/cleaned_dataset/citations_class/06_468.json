The underlying assumption of s 50 is the principle of open justice. The fact that the order must be necessary to prevent prejudice suggests that the party seeking to invoke a power of suppression carries a very heavy onus; see Madgwick J in Computer Interchange at [16] and Weinberg J in Johnston v Cameron at [89]. As such, the Court must consider the alleged prejudice that would be suffered by the respondent should the s 50 order not be granted. The Court must also determine whether the order is necessary to prevent this prejudice and whether this warrants a departure from the ordinary rule that open justice occur.\",\"1\":\"14.

The respondent's alternate submission, that it should not suffer or be put at serious risk of collateral damage or disadvantage through the abuse of the maps, is not made out on the evidence before the Court. Mr Stone gave evidence that the release of the maps bearing the labels applied by Mr Dell \\\"would perpetuate and promulgate this misrepresentation, and create an opportunity for abuse\\\". Presumably this \\\"abuse\\\" would be use of the information in a way designed to influence public opinion. However, it is well established that embarrassing or damaging publicity will not amount to prejudice warranting a departure from the principle of open justice; see Merkel J, with whom Finn and Stone JJ agreed in Herald & Weekly Times Ltd v Williams and Others [2003] FCAFC 217 ; (2003) 130 FCR 435 at [34] [36]. Further, the description of the maps as provisional plans rather than \\\"indicative scenario models\\\" or some such title cannot elevate the status of any potential use of this information to that of prejudice to the administration of justice.\\n\\n23. In any event, the maps which the respondent seeks to protect by this s 50 application are already protected from inspection without leave of the Court or a Judge, or without the permission of the Registrar by O 46 r 6(4) of the Rules of the Court. As such, the Court will exercise its discretion to prevent access in circumstances where inspection would be prejudicial to the administration of justice. There has been no suggestion by the respondent that the s 50 order is necessary to prevent prejudice caused by a party other than a third party. Given the existing protection offered by O 46 r 6(4), the s 50 order is not necessary to prevent prejudice in respect to the administration of justice and the motion fails on this additional ground.\\n\\n24. The respondent has also applied to the Court for an order under O 15 r 18 of the Rules of the Court to prevent the undertakings given by the applicant on 15 September 2005 from ceasing to apply. This application is brought by the respondent \\\"only out of an abundance of caution and in order to prevent there being any argument about this aspect of the matter\\\". Counsel for the respondent submitted that it was the intention of the respondent, evident from the terms of the undertakings, that those undertakings ensue for its benefit during the proceeding and after the hearing of it.\"}}"
