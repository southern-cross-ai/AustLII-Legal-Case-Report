"{\"id\":{\"0\":\"c0\"},\"class\":{\"0\":\"cited\"},\"tocase\":{\"0\":\"Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd [1981] HCA 45 ; (1987) 147 CLR 589\"},\"text\":{\"0\":\"Mr Nicholls said that the evidence which would support the application for a review of the decisions, which had been impugned in the proceedings before Mansfield J was different than that which had been adduced before his Honour in the proceeding disposed of on 15 January 2009. He said he had obtained information during the currency of those proceedings and the proceedings disposed of by Mansfield J on 23 July 2009 and under the Freedom of Information Act , which would allow him to challenge those decisions on other evidential bases. In my opinion, that also is not a good reason to stay the orders of 23 July 2009 made by Mansfield J. The time for Mr Nicholls to adduce evidence in relation to the decisions in which he complained was in the proceeding brought before Mansfield J which was disposed of in his orders of 15 January 2009. It is not appropriate for the applicant to split his case or split his applications and rely upon different evidence for a review of the same decisions: Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd [1981] HCA 45 ; (1981) 147 CLR 589.\\n\\nIn my opinion, the fact of the issue of the proceedings in the Federal Magistrates Court does not support the application for a stay. The application then for a stay of Mansfield J's orders of 23 July 2009 is refused.\\n I certify that the preceding nine (9) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Lander. \\n \\n Associate:\\n \\n \\nDated: 4 September 2009\\n \\n Counsel for the Applicant Ms L Chapman \\n \\n Solicitor for the Applicant Australian Government Solicitor \\n \\n The Respondent appeared in person. \\n Date of Hearing: 25 August 2009 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 25 August 2009 \\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2009\\/1002.html\"}}"
