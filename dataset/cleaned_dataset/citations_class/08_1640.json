That case concerned a Pt A competition notice issued by ACCC under s 151AKA of the Act. Section 151AKA(10) provided, relevantly, that ACCC must not issue such a notice unless it had first given the addressee carrier or carriage service provider a written notice inviting it to make a submission to ACCC on the proposal to issue the Pt A competition notice.\\n\\n28 In Telstra v ACCC (No 3) , ACCC sought leave to argue that there should be a severance of the respective parts of the Pt A competition notice pursuant to s 46 of the AI Act so as to preserve the validity of those parts which had been notified in the notice of invitation. Her Honour held (at [83] [91]) that there could not be a severance. She held that s 46 had no application to a decision made under an Act as distinct from an instrument (at [55]) and also distinguished between questions of severance involving an \\\"excess of power\\\" and a lack of power to make an entire instrument (at [57]).\\n\\n29 It suffices to say that s 151AKA(10) was a prohibition on the issuing of a Pt A competition notice unless ACCC had first taken the steps mandated by s 151AKA(10)(a).\\n\\n30 The statutory provisions in the present case are different. Section 152CR(1) required ACCC to take specified matters into account in making a decision, namely, a final determination, and s 152AQA required ACCC to have regard to any determination of principles relating to the price of access to a declared service if it was required to arbitrate (make a decision upon) an access dispute under Div 8 in relation to that service.\"}}"
