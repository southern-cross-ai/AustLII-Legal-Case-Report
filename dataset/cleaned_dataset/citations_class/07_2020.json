The complexities of modern cross-border insolvency make it likely that this beneficial provision will be exercised more in the future than it has been exercised in the past. Jersey is a prescribed country by reason of reg 3.01 of the Bankruptcy Regulations 1996 . Therefore, the Court is obliged to act in aid of, and be auxiliary to, Jersey courts with jurisdiction in bankruptcy (s 29(2)(a) of the Act). A request pursuant to s 29(4) is not limited to the court of a prescribed country. Although there is no requirement to establish that it is likely that the foreign court will honour the request before the court should act under s 29(4) ( Clunies-Ross v Totterdell (1988) 20 FCR 358 at 361), the evidence establishes that the Royal Court of Jersey will so act.\",\"1\":\"5 No forms of request are prescribed and there are no Regulations or Rules of Court setting out any procedural requirements.

I am satisfied that the form of the request is appropriately specific in accordance with Re Mann (1887) 13 VLR 590. I would leave for another day the question whether that authority should continue to be applied to the provision as now framed. It is not clear to me that a request should not be general in form, the \\\"matter\\\" being the administration of the particular bankrupt estate, leaving it to the foreign court to decide precisely how the assistance might be afforded.\"}}"
