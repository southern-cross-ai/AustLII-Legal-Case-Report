An order dismissing an application for an order nisi is interlocutory: see NAHQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 297 ; (2003) 134 FCR 377 at 378 [3] . Accordingly, leave to appeal is required by s 24(1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). The applicant has not obtained leave to appeal.\\n\\n3 However, counsel for the first respondent informed the Court that the first respondent did not oppose this application being treated as an application for leave to appeal. I have proceeded on that basis and will treat this application as an application for leave to appeal.\",\"1\":\"4 An application for leave to appeal falls to be determined by reference to the principles established by the Full Court's decision in Decor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc (1991) 33 FCR 397. That case applied a two-limbed test to determine when leave to appeal from an interlocutory decision should be granted. First, the decision below must be attended with sufficient doubt to warrant its being reconsidered by this Court; secondly, substantial injustice must be demonstrated if leave were to be refused, supposing the decision to be wrong: at 398.\\n\\n5 The principal submission made on behalf of the first respondent was that the applicant has not satisfied the first of these requirements. That is, the first respondent submitted that the Federal Magistrate's decision is not attended with sufficient doubt as to warrant its reconsideration by this Court.\\n\\n6 It is convenient to note the origins of this proceeding. The applicant filed an application in the High Court for an order nisi on 21 April 2003, which was remitted to the Federal Court by Heydon J on 25 August 2003. The matter was remitted to the Federal Magistrates Court by Emmett J on 5 August 2005.\",\"2\":\"21 The question whether conduct is sufficiently serious to amount to persecution is a factual matter for the Tribunal: see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SZANS [2005] FCAFC 41 at [50] - [53] ; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Kord [2002] FCA 334 ; (2002) 125 FCR 68 at [3] , [50] [53]. On a fair reading of the Tribunal's reasons, the reference to harassment and discrimination not reaching a sufficient level of seriousness to be characterised as persecution referred to the harassment and discrimination suffered by the applicant and his family after the war. In my view, the Tribunal's reference was not directed to the physical assault that the applicant suffered. In any event, I am not satisfied that the Tribunal's findings of fact were unreasonable or erroneous or not reasonably open to it.\",\"3\":\"21 The question whether conduct is sufficiently serious to amount to persecution is a factual matter for the Tribunal: see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SZANS [2005] FCAFC 41 at [50] - [53] ; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Kord [2002] FCA 334 ; (2002) 125 FCR 68 at [3] , [50] [53].

In any event, I am not satisfied that the Tribunal's findings of fact were unreasonable or erroneous or not reasonably open to it.\",\"4\":\"23 The second ground relied upon by the applicant is that the Tribunal applied the wrong test in applying s 91R(1)(a) of the Act. The applicant submitted that the Tribunal found that the essential and significant motivation for the harm feared by the applicant was that criminals wanted to take control of his family's assets. According to the applicant, the Tribunal arrived at this conclusion erroneously by considering the 'primary motivating factor' in the actions taken by the criminals. In substance, the applicant's argument is that the expression 'primary motivating factor' departed from the language of the Act and led the Tribunal to address the wrong question, giving rise to a jurisdictional error: cf Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259.\\n\\n24 The Tribunal's reasons for decision ought not to be read in an over-technical or pedantic way. They must be read fairly and in context. The expression 'primary motivating factor' was used by the Tribunal on one occasion. Elsewhere in its reasons, both before and afterwards, the Tribunal used the phrase 'the essential and significant reason' or 'the essential and significant motivation'. These expressions correctly reflect the test that is required in relation to s 91R(1)(a). I agree with the submission made on behalf of the first respondent that when the various passages in the Tribunal's reasons are considered together and in context, it becomes clear that the Tribunal applied the correct test. In my opinion, there was no error in the Tribunal's conclusion that the applicant's evidence concerning what happened to his family strongly suggest that the essential and significant reason for these events was that criminals wanted to take control of his family's assets.\\n\\n25 This conclusion was reached by Scarlett FM and I agree with his Honour's reasons.\",\"5\":\"26 The third ground raised by the applicant was that the Tribunal did not adequately consider whether or not the State of Bangladesh had tolerated, condoned or was complicit in the criminal activities of Mohammed Ali and his associates. The applicant submitted that the Tribunal had therefore failed to deal with the integers of the applicant's claim, thereby constituting a jurisdictional error: Htun v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2001) 194 ALR 244 at 259 [42]; W396\\/01 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2002) 68 ALD 69 at [31]-[38]; SAAD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 65 at [40] . The applicant contended that the criminal activities directed at his family were instigated, and were successful, because the criminals knew that the State would fail to offer protection to the applicant and his family due to their Pakistani ethnicity. The applicant complained that there was evidence before the Tribunal of the State's tolerance and complicity in the criminal activity perpetrated against his family and himself because of their ethnicity.\",\"6\":\"26 The third ground raised by the applicant was that the Tribunal did not adequately consider whether or not the State of Bangladesh had tolerated, condoned or was complicit in the criminal activities of Mohammed Ali and his associates.

There is, therefore, substance in the applicant's complaint that the Tribunal asked the wrong question by stating that the applicant could avoid persecution on his return to Bangladesh. The Tribunal should have inquired into what may happen to the appellant if he returned to Bangladesh. However, I do not regard this deficiency in the Tribunal's reasons as providing a basis for granting leave to appeal. The Tribunal determined the case adversely to the applicant on the basis that it was not satisfied that the essential and significant reason for any harm that the applicant has suffered in the past, or fears in the future, was for a Convention reason. The Tribunal did not fall into error in reaching that conclusion.\",\"9\":\"33 As counsel for the first respondent conceded, this statement is problematical: see Appellant S395 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 71 ; (2003) 216 CLR 473; Applicant NABD of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 29 ; (2005) 216 ALR 1.
