The applicants refer to the decision in Skyes v Stratton [1972] 1 NSWLR 145 at 160 and submit that any contract or arrangement is illegal if it is made for the purpose of or has the effect of defeating, evading, avoiding or preventing the operation of the Regulations. They submit that the evidence prima facie establishes the existence of such arrangement between the deceased and the respondent.\\n\\n14 The applicants submit that unless restrained, the respondent may destroy relevant records and deal with assets derived from the estate in such a manner as may defeat the interests of the Commissioner of Taxation. Further, there may be tax liabilities of the estate which will need to be met from the assets held overseas. The applicant's concern is based upon the fact that the respondent has refused requests to make disclosure of the existence of such assets.\\n\\n15 In these proceedings the applicants are trustees as defined by s 254(1) of the ITAA 36. By virtue of s 254(1)(f) of the ITAA 36 trustees are indemnified for all payments which they may make pursuant to the ITAA 36 or of any requirement by the Commissioner.\"}}"
