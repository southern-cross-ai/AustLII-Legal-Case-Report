It must, however, be a discretion exercised in a manner which promotes the objects of the Act, including the protection of the interests of policy holders in ways consistent with \\\" the continued development of a viable, competitive and innovative insurance industry \\\". A \\\" critical consideration \\\" is \\\" whether affected policyholders will be detrimentally affected by the implementation of the scheme \\\": PMI Indemnity Limited (No 2) [2005] FCA 1842 at [24] per Lindgren J.\\n\\n14 Section 32 of the 1973 Act, it should further be noted, provides that the Authority may also determine \\\" prudential standards \\\" that must be complied with. Of immediate relevance to the present proceedings are three such standards, namely:\\n \\n(i) Prudential Standard GPS 110 -- which deals with \\\" Capital Adequacy \\\" and aims to ensure that the security of policy holder obligations of all insurers is established at an appropriate level by requiring that each general insurer maintain at least a minimum amount of capital;\\n \\n(ii) Prudential Standard GPS 310 -- which deals with audit and actuarial reporting and outlines the roles and responsibilities of a general insurer's Approved Actuary; and\\n \\n(iii) Prudential Standard GPS 410 -- which deals with the transfer and amalgamation of the insurance business of a general insurer.\\n \\nAlso of relevance is:\\n \\n(iv) A \\\" Prudential Practice Guide (Draft) \\\" which deals with \\\" Capital Adequacy \\\" and \\\" Capital Management \\\".\\n\\n15 The \\\" Summary of the Scheme \\\" in the present proceedings was approved by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and sets out the effect of the Scheme as follows:\\n Summary of scheme The following is a summary of the scheme: \\n(a) All of the rights, liabilities and obligations of BIC under policies issued or underwritten by BIC in the conduct of BIC's Australian insurance business will be transferred to A&G and become rights, liabilities and obligations of A&G. BIC will be released and discharged from these liabilities and obligations and will cease to operate an insurance business in Australia.\\n \\n(b) A cash amount equal to the value of the liabilities assumed by A&G (net of reinsurance and third party recoveries) will be transferred from BIC to A&G. Reinsurance treaties held for the benefit of BIC will be assigned to A&G.\\n \\n(c) Except for A&G being substituted for BIC as insurer, the transfer will not result in any change to policy benefits or policy terms and conditions under policies issued or underwritten by BIC.\\n \\n(d) The rights, benefits, obligations and liabilities of holders of policies issued by BIC in Australia will be the same as if those policies had been issued or underwritten by A&G instead of BIC. Claims under such policies are to be made to A&G, instead of BIC.\\n \\n(e) BIC will bear the costs and expenses relating to the transfer and the scheme.\\n \\n(f) The transfer will take effect on the first business day after the date on which the scheme is confirmed by the Court.\",\"5\":\"10 Section 17C sets out those steps which must be undertaken before an application may be \\\" made \\\" for confirmation.
