In circumstances where: \\n \\n \\n (a) the notice ... required the production of the ... DVDs 'forthwith'; \\n (b) [the applicant] was afforded no opportunity to verify the contents of the DVDs; and \\n (c) [the applicant] was handed the ... DVDs at a time when his presence at the [Commission's] offices was involuntary \\n \\n \\n possession of the 'thing' did not pass to [the applicant].\\\" \\n \\n\\n(The emphases are in the original.) The applicant also cites Chairman, National Crime Authority v Flack (1998) 156 ALR 501 as discussing the relevant authorities. (The Commission does not dispute the facts set out in sub-paras (a) to (c) of the passage quoted above.)\\n\\n48 The applicant's contentions in the passage quoted at [47] are fundamentally unsound. The qualification of \\\"custody, possession and\\/or control\\\" by \\\"the requisite sense\\\" begs the question of what that sense is. The terms of the notice are clear. There is no reason to read them down. In the events that occurred, possession however fleeting of the DVDs passed to the applicant when they were handed to him. It is beside the point that they were created by the Commission and handed to him in the knowledge or with the intention that he would immediately thereafter be compelled by way of the notice to hand them back. Until he was so compelled he was in possession of them. It is also beside the point that he was not in possession of them when the notice was issued as opposed to when the notice was served on him. As far as he was concerned, the notice was a dead letter unless and until it was served on him.\\n\\n52 The authorities discussed in Flack avail the applicant nothing. They include the 'finding' cases of Bridges v Hawkesworth (1851) 21 LJQB 75, South Staffordshire Water Company v Sharman [1896] 2 QB 44 and Parker v British Airways Board [1982] 1 QB 1004. This is not a 'finding' case. The DVDs were handed to the applicant at the Commission's offices. The question whether the Commission intended to exercise control over its offices to the extent that it owns things found therein by strangers simply does not arise for determination.\",\"8\":\"49 The Commission referred to the decision of Hill J in Puglisi v Australian Fisheries Management Authority (1997) 148 ALR 393 at 396 and 403. In that case, material had been 'seized' at two premises. However, those 'seizures' were defective. In order to remedy those defects, the material was returned to the respective premises and 're-seized'. At 396, his Honour said:\\n \\\"At the premises at Bungo Street the goods which had been seized were brought into the house and then re-seized. However, at 40 Parson Street the seized goods remained in the police vehicle stationary in the driveway and Mr Puglisi's wife was asked to come out to the vehicle and identify the material. The material was 're-seized' while it was still in the vehicle ... and driven away.\\\" \\n \\n\\nAt 403, his Honour said:\\n \\n \\\"In my view the items that were in the Federal Police car were never 'found' at the Parson Street premises in the course of a search. Nor were they ever then 'seized'. The items were always in the possession of the ... Federal Police and in the car. In my view it would be a misuse of language to speak of items always in the possession of the ... Federal Police as being 'found' at premises merely because they are in a car owned by the Federal Police parked in the premises. Nor can items held by the ... Federal Police be seized by the Federal Police from the Federal Police.\\\" \\n \\n\\nClearly, the situation in the instant proceeding was different from that in Puglisi . The DVDs were handed back to the applicant. That is analogous to the situation at the Bungo Street premises rather than that at the Parson Street premises referred to above.\\n\\n50 The fact that the applicant was not afforded an opportunity to verify that the DVDs' contents matched their description in the notice does not detract from the fact that he was in possession of the DVDs at time the notice was served on him. Only if the DVDs' contents did not match their description would the notice have been defective because it compelled the applicant to produce \\\"forthwith\\\" a thing that was not in his \\\"custody, possession and\\/or control\\\".\\n\\n51 The fact that the applicant was served with the notice during his involuntary attendance at the Commission's offices is neither here nor there.\",\"9\":\"52 The authorities discussed in Flack avail the applicant nothing.

That lack of evidence is unexceptionable because the applicant failed to adduce evidence that the examiner was not so satisfied and first raised the issue of whether or not the examiner was so satisfied on the day the hearing of the application commenced. For those reasons:\\n \\u2022 it is not appropriate for me to draw an inference of the sort described by Windeyer J in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 at 320-321 from the Commission's failure to adduce evidence from Messrs Hellings or Goodchild whose roles in the procurement of the notice are described at [44](d) or the examiner; and\\n \\u2022 I need not deal with the applicant's contention that the examiner could not have been satisfied in the requisite sense when he issued the notice because he must have known that the Commission created the DVDs and\\/or that the applicant was not, at that point in time, in \\\"custody, possession and\\/or control\\\" of the DVDs.\",\"13\":\"56 For the above reasons, I would dismiss the application with costs. Further, if I am wrong in any of those reasons, I would, in the exercise of my discretion, refuse to grant the relief sought. In Johnson v Williams (2000) 58 ALD 1 at [24] and [25], the Full Court of this Court said:\\n \\\"One matter that is properly to be taken into account in proceedings to quash or have declared invalid an administrative decision is whether there has been delay in bringing the proceeding. Courts quite properly take the view that there is a need for a speedy determination of the validity of an administrative decision. The interests of good administration and third parties are at stake: O'Reilly v Mackman [1983] UKHL 1 ; [1983] 2 AC 237 at 284; Caswell v Dairy Produce Quota Tribunal for England & Wales [1990] UKHL 5 ; [1990] 2 AC 738. Unreasonable or unaccounted for delay cannot be tolerated. \\n \\n The timely action that is required is the commencement of proceedings for or in the nature of judicial review.\\\" \\n \\n\\n(The emphasis is mine.) In that case, the relief sought from and refused by the primary judge was an order to quash a decision of the Attorney-General to refuse to withdraw a request for extradition.\\n\\n57 In the present case, the warrant was issued on 13 February 2004 and executed the following day. The notice was issued and served on 19 February 2004. The application was filed on 21 December 2005: over 22 months after the events that gave rise to it occurred. The applicant has failed to explain his inordinate delay in commencing proceedings. His attempt to do so by the affidavit of Philip Cadman (of his solicitors) fails. Mr Cadman deposed that:\\n \\\"The ... warrant ... and the ... notice ... form part of a clandestine investigation conducted in circumstances of confidentiality and secrecy. Prior to the [Commission] releasing details of actions taken in the course of their investigations ... [by way of certain press releases issued in June 2005 and exhibited to Mr Andrew's affidavit], it was not possible for the applicant or any other members of the public to be aware that materials outside the scope of the warrant and the notice ... were being acted on by the [Commission].\\\" \\n \\n\\nApart from being hearsay, this is beside the point. The applicant complains that the Commission's exercise of coercive power in the form of a substantial interference with his personal property was unlawful because it was done pursuant to an unlawful warrant and notice. What happened afterwards is irrelevant to the basis upon which that complaint is made. At most, it merely to put it colloquially raised the stakes for the applicant in his attempt to impugn the warrant and the notice.\\n\\n58 In any case, Mr Cadman's evidence is contradicted by other evidence adduced by the applicant. Michael Carr (of other solicitors for the applicant) deposed that on 19 February 2004 a member of the Commission advised the applicant in the presence of himself and Mr Galbally QC who appeared for the applicant before me that\\n \\\"the investigation being conducted by the [Commission] would be broadened to include other persons who the applicant had dealings with, as identified in correspondence contained on the applicant's computer [and] stated words to the ... effect [that] '[t]here will be another search warrant'.\\\" \\n \\n\\nIt is neither here nor there that no such warrant was obtained.\",\"14\":\"59 In the circumstances, I need not deal with the Commission's alternative submission that, if the applicant had made out a case for relief, I should not order the return of the information obtained pursuant to the warrant and the notice or prohibit its use, so as to preserve it for use in foreshadowed criminal proceedings pending a determination of the trial judge therein as to whether or not it should be excluded on the grounds that it was unlawfully obtained.
