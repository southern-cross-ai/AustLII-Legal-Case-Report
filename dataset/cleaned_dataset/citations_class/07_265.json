This is tied to the fifth particular, that the Tribunal was well aware of the appellant's health problems because he collapsed at the adjourned hearing. However as the Federal Magistrate observed at [20]-[21] these matters were considered by the Tribunal. The Tribunal adjourned the hearing twice. The appellant was afforded the opportunity to put further submissions in writing. The Tribunal concluded, having regard to the appellant's medical certificates, that his headaches was caused by hypertension and overwork and not as a result of mistreatment by Chinese authorities. It also found that the appellant's inability to give details of Falun Gong was by reason of his ignorance of the practices, rather than his health problems. It was well open to the Tribunal to so find: Abebe v Commonwealth [1999] HCA 14 ; (1999) 197 CLR 510 at [137] ; Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Durairajasingham [2000] HCA 1 ; (2000) 168 ALR 407 at [67] ; W148\\/00A v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2001) 185 ALR 703 at [64]-[65].\\n\\n24 As the first respondent submitted and as I accept the Tribunal's decision was ultimately based on the vagueness of the appellant's claims; his ignorance of Falun Gong practises; and, based on country information, the improbability of a person of adverse interest to the Chinese authorities which the appellant claimed to be being given a passport and being able to easily leave China which the appellant did. Such reasoning based on credibility of testimony and consistency with independent country information was clearly within the Tribunal's jurisdiction: Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Durairajasingham [2000] HCA 1 ; (2000) 168 ALR 407 at [67] per McHugh J; W148\\/00A v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2001) 185 ALR 703 at [64]-[65].

However I am persuaded that the findings of fact were well open to the Tribunal.\",\"1\":\"14 The Federal Magistrate considered this generalised complaint in two possible ways. Firstly if this was a request at merits review then he correctly found that to be beyond the jurisdiction of the court: Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 272.\",\"2\":\"15 Secondly, if it was an allegation of bias then as he found correctly it was not particularised or supported by evidence. Such an allegation must of course be firmly and distinctly made and clearly proved: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia Le Geng [2001] HCA 17 ; (2001) 205 CLR 507.\",\"3\":\"18 The appellant submitted that the Tribunal failed to either speak with the appellant's doctor or the Asylum Seekers Centre before making its decision. The Federal Magistrate at [21], correctly held that s 424 of the Act empowers but does not oblige the Tribunal to actively seek information. The Tribunal has no obligation to exercise its inquisitorial powers: WAEH of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCAFC 364 at [19] - [24] ; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SGLB [2004] HCA 32 ; (2004) 207 ALR 12 at [43] .\",\"4\":\"17 The appellant submitted that the Tribunal ignored the fact that the appellant was seeking assistance from the Asylum Seekers Centre and that the Tribunal failed to contact an officer of that centre as the appellant had requested. The Tribunal is empowered but not obliged to seek out information. It was for the appellant to put his case to the Tribunal. It was entitled to decide his case by reference to his claims and the evidence put before it without looking further: NABE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 263 ; (2004) 144 FCR 1 at [61] .\",\"5\":\"16 It is submitted that the Tribunal ignored the appellant's claim that he was suffering from serious headaches and tension as a result of being tortured by the PSB in China.
