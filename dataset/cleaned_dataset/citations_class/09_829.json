Smithers J observed (at 81) that: \\n \\\"Considerable novelty may be appropriate in a scheme submitted under s 171D. It would seem that the court should be guided not by any narrow interpretation of s.171D, but should respond to the purpose of that section in the context of the Act ... \\n\\n \\n Section 171D is in the midst of the sections last mentioned and stems from the intention of parliament to revive the effective management and administration of organisations when governing bodies have become defunct or impotent or are unable to function effectively because the rules failed to speak effectively in the relevant current circumstances. Its provisions should therefore be liberally construed.\\\"\\n\\nSee to like effect per Northrop J at 91 and cf the more cautious approach of Keely J at 100-101.\\n\\nBy reason of the events which I have earlier summarised I am satisfied that the Branch has ceased to function effectively. Over the past year it has limped from one internal crisis to the next and the underlying causes of the Branch's dysfunction remain unresolved.\",\"1\":\"The forerunner of s 323 is to be found in s 171D of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904 (Cth). This provision was declared to be constitutionally valid by the High Court in Re Joske; Ex parte Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Association [1976] HCA 48 ; (1976) 135 CLR 194 at 218, notwithstanding the broad powers which it conferred on the Court.\"}}"
