The nature of a finance market and the width of possible markets which are raised by the letter of 23 August 2005 and Unwired's explanatory memorandum to its shareholders in explanation of this transaction will require close and careful attention, including in relation to issues of markets and market definition. It will be necessary to revisit carefully the further pleadings on these points.\\n\\n66 However, Unwired's allegations of a contravention of s 46 are arguable and I am not satisfied that they should be dismissed at this time. But, I have real concerns as to their long-term sustainability, having regard to what is written in the letter of 23 August 2005 and the explanatory memorandum. For the moment, I think that the best course is to strike out pars 117-129 with leave to re-plead, so that Unwired can give some clarity to the overall nature of the contravention on which it relies. This is even though, as I have said, it may be perfectly legitimate for it to have pleaded some of those allegations in the form currently expressed. However, the whole pleading of this part of the amended defence should receive attention in a cognate way.\",\"11\":\"75 But, before dismissing this aspect of the proceedings entirely, if I were otherwise minded to accede to Intel's arguments, I am of opinion that I should give Unwired one further opportunity to set out in its pleadings the necessary material facts.

I do not think that Unwired's pleading does articulate, in that way, a clear basis for asserting that a penalty would be incurred by it. I am of opinion that it is necessary to plead more than the merely formulaic words contained in par 74 of Unwired's amended defence.\\n\\n73 If this point is to be articulated, even in circumstances where ultimately it might have to be struck out, it should be done in a pleading that clearly raises whatever is the triable issue which Unwired ultimately seeks to use to defend itself from liability to pay this amount as a penalty. For these reasons, pars 74 and 75 are not sufficient, in themselves, to bring out the novel claim that Unwired wishes to make and should be struck out.\\n\\n74 I am concerned that the caution expressed by Allsop P should not be ignored. On the other hand, courts have to be mindful that when a party wishes to raise a test case, at least the elements for the test should be stated clearly in the pleadings. In this way, ultimately, it will be possible to apply the test, as to whether the redemption premium amount is a penalty, assessed on the conventional basis which, as a judge at first instance, I would ordinarily be obliged to apply, or by using some other test to determine whether the proceedings should be dismissed under s 31A , or otherwise stuck out as untenable.

But it is a commercial document intended to be the foundation of a contractual relationship embodied in the notes when issued. The ordinary principles of construction of contracts should be applied to the provisions of the deed poll, as well as to the transaction overall. These principles require the rights of the parties to be determined objectively, without reference to their subjective beliefs or understandings about what rights or liabilities would govern their relationship. What matters is what each party, by words and conduct, would have led a reasonable person in the position of the other party to believe. In this context, the role of the Court is to ascertain the common intention of the parties in the commercial matrix in which they contracted. This process involves discerning, in context, what a reasonable person would understand from the language in which the parties expressed their agreement, having regard to the objective surrounding circumstances with the purpose and the object of a transaction: Toll (FGCT) Pty Limited v Alphapharm Pty Limited [2004] HCA 52 ; (2004) 219 CLR 165 at 179 [40] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ.
