The discretion to extend time within which to appeal from an interlocutory decision is that conferred by O 52, r 15(2) of the Federal Court Rules and not O 52, r 5(2).

As was concluded in Metwally v University of Wollongong [1985] HCA 28 ; (1985) 60 ALR 68 at 71 per Gibbs CJ, Mason, Wilson, Brennan, Deane and Dawson JJ:\\n It is elementary that a party is bound by the conduct of his case.

The discretion conferred by s 24(1A) to grant leave to appeal may be accepted as being conferred in \\\" unqualified terms \\\". But however wide that discretion may be, it would be a surprising exercise of that discretion should leave be granted in such circumstances.\\n\\n17 The arguments sought to be raised by the Draft Notice of Appeal are, in any event, each without substance. There is no reason why leave to appeal could not be confined to a particular proposed ground -- as opposed to leave being granted in respect to the Draft Notice of Appeal in its entirety.

The Tribunal put to the applicant that it was not possible to know for sure that the police would not act on his behalf without a bribe unless he actually reported the incidents to them. The applicant claimed that he had experience with the traffic police and knows that they ask for money for any reason and will beat you if you do not pay them. \\nNot only is there a divergence between the manner in which the proceeding was conducted before the Federal Magistrates Court and this Court, there is also a divergence between the factual account now sought to be advanced for determination by this Court and the factual account advanced before the Tribunal.
