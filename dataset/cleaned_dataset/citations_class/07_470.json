In Red Earth at [34] Ryan J said:\\n \\n \\\"It is now well established that the knowledge of a solicitor joining a new firm should not automatically be imputed or attributed to other lawyers or employees at that firm (see Re a Firm of Solicitors [1992] QB 959 at 973, per Staughton LJ; Unioil International Pty Ltd v Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu (1997) 17 WAR 98, per Ipp J at 110-111; Newman v Phillips Fox (1999) 21 WAR 309, per Steytler J; Bolkiah (supra) at 235). As Lord Millett said in Bolkiah , whether a particular individual is in possession of confidential information is a question of fact to be proved or inferred from the circumstances of the case: ( Bolkiah at 235. See also the observation of Steytler J in Newman v Phillips Fox (supra) at 317).\\n\\n33 Applying that principle, and assuming the onus is on BDW, I am satisfied that no relevant information was passed on to anyone at BDW. The detailed evidence both from Mr Lindwall and Ms Schweirkert and from solicitors at BDW, the veracity of which was not challenged, enables that conclusion to be safely drawn. The circumstances point the same way. A large and reputable firm like BDW would be aware of the obvious potential conflict when a solicitor previously acting on the other side of litigation has joined them. This would be clear, notwithstanding that Corrs had ceased acting for Arkaroola some six months earlier. So there was all the more reason to take positive steps, such as notifying the former client of Mr Lindwall and going out of their way to ensure that he had nothing to do with any matters relating to that client.\\n\\n34 As events have turned out, Mr Lindwall and Ms Schweikert left BDW before the present Federal Court litigation commenced so the risk of even accidental communication of relevant information hereafter can be ignored.\",\"3\":\"28 In recent times applications to restrain solicitors from acting against clients or former clients have arisen not infrequently and have been the subject of detailed consideration in Australian courts, in particular in Spincode Pty Ltd v Look Software Pty Ltd [2001] VSCA 248 ; (2001) 4 VR 501 (Victorian Court of Appeal), Bureau Interprofessionnel des Vins de Bourgogne v Red Earth Nominees Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 588 (Ryan J), Photocure ASA v Queen's University at Kingston (2002) 56 IPR 86 (Goldberg J) and Geelong School Supplies Pty Ltd v Dean [2006] FCA 1404 (Young J).
