Nevertheless, all the causes of action are based on the conduct of the second respondent acting for the first respondent on 27 March 2006 and its aftermath. The doctrine of res judicata may apply in relation to the cause of action in the present proceeding based on breaches of the deed of settlement but it does not apply to the other causes of action in the present proceeding. The doctrine of issue estoppel in the strict sense may apply to those causes of action, although it is difficult to be at all certain because of the lack of coherence in the applicant's pleadings in the present proceeding. The extended doctrine of issue estoppel as articulated in Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd [1981] HCA 45 ; (1981) 147 CLR 589 (\\\"Anshun estoppel\\\") certainly applies in relation to all of the other claims and there is no reason they could not have been brought in the earlier proceeding. In the circumstances, the pursuit of the other claims is an abuse of process.\\n\\n33 I turn now to consider the claim for unlawful discrimination.\\n\\n34 In his amended statement of claim, the applicant alleges breaches or contraventions by the respondents of ss 5 , 6 , 22 and 24 of the DD Act . Section 22(1) plainly does not apply because, on any view, the alleged discrimination is not of a type which falls within the terms of that subsection. Subsection (2) provides:\\n \\n \\n \\n It is unlawful for an educational authority to discriminate against a student on the ground of the student's disability or a disability of any of the student's associates:\\n \\n \\n \\n(a) by denying the student access, or limiting the student's access, to any benefit provided by the educational authority; or (b) by expelling the student; or (c) by subjecting the student to any other detriment.\",\"7\":\"11 The applicant lodged an appeal against the order I made dismissing the proceeding but, on 4 December 2007, the Full Court of this Court dismissed the appeal and ordered that the appellant in the appeal pay the respondent's costs thereof: Rana v University of South Australia [2007] FCAFC 188.\\n\\n12 The applicant then applied to the High Court for special leave to appeal against the orders made by the Full Court but, on 15 May 2008, that application was dismissed.\\n\\n13 One other point to note about the earlier proceeding is this. Before the present proceeding was instituted, the applicant made a complaint about the respondent's conduct to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (\\\"the Commission\\\") (as it then was). In the course of a directions hearing in the earlier proceeding held on 14 July 2006, I fixed 17 and 18 August 2006 for the trial of the earlier proceeding. Those dates were subsequently vacated and, as I have said, the proceeding was heard on 5 and 6 October 2006. The point to be made is that at the directions hearing held on 14 July 2006, the applicant said that he had a complaint of \\\"disability discrimination on the same fact by the University\\\". He said that the complaint had been lodged with the Commission. He said that the first respondent had asked for an extension of time to respond. The applicant raised the possibility of the proceeding then before the Court (that is, the earlier proceeding) being delayed so that it could be dealt with at the same time as any proceeding following the applicant's complaint to the Commission. In response, counsel for the first respondent said:\\n Your Honour, we sought an extension of time from the Human Rights Commission. Perhaps we ought more properly have explained to them that these proceedings were on foot because, as I understand it, that would forestall the progression of any complaint stage in the Commission, and that is their policy, that is my understanding of their policy. The matter is only at the complaint stage; no proceedings have been issued. ... ... as I understand it the complaint stage needs to be worked through the Commission and examined by the Commissioner before formal proceedings are able to be initiated. We have undertaken mediation unsuccessfully. I think that the parties are some great difference apart in terms of the legal basis of the claim, but the mediation did crystallise some of the issues and we would seek that the matter be brought to trial as expeditiously as possible because we see that the trial is the only way to resolve those matters.\",\"8\":\"8 The trial of the earlier proceeding was held on 5 and 6 October 2006. On 31 May 2007, I made an order that the proceeding be dismissed and I delivered reasons for judgment: Rana v University of South Australia [2007] FCA 816. I will refer to those reasons as the earlier judgment.\\n\\n9 One point to note, and the relevance of this will become apparent, is that in the course of the earlier judgment I said (at [4]) that I found the applicant \\\"a most unsatisfactory witness\\\" and that I did not accept his evidence except where it accorded with other evidence which I accepted. I said that the applicant's evidence as to important events changed during the course of the proceeding, that some of his evidence was highly improbable and a good deal of his evidence was inconsistent with evidence which I accepted.\",\"9\":\"10 On 19 June 2007, I made an order that the applicant pay the respondent's costs of the proceeding on an indemnity basis: Rana v University of South Australia (No 2) [2007] FCA 941. I said the following (at [6]):\\n In my opinion, this is an appropriate case for the award of indemnity costs. Mr Rana made allegations about payment for the tickets and what occurred at the Convention Centre which were critical to his case and he must have known were untrue. Those allegations should not have been made. He claimed that he had suffered loss and damage of $1 million but he proved no loss or damage. He altered a document, namely, a receipt, so that his case would appear stronger. These circumstances alone justify an award of indemnity costs. A further and probably independent reason for awarding indemnity costs is that he refused an offer of $400 in relation to a claim which I dismissed. In all the circumstances, it is appropriate to order that costs be paid on an indemnity basis.\",\"10\":\"43 First, in my opinion, to relitigate the events of 27 March 2006 is an abuse of process and the pursuit of the claim for unlawful discrimination would involve a relitigation of the events of 27 March 2006.
