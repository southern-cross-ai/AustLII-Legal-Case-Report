That which is not to be permitted is for a claimant to \\\" reformulate his claims on an ex post facto basis \\\": SZLWI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1330 at [23] , [2008] FCA 1330 ; 171 FCR 134 at 140 per Gilmour J.\",\"6\":\"The requirements imposed by s 430(1) (and in particular s 430(1)(c)) were considered by the High Court in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 , 206 CLR 323. In rejecting a contention that s 430 requires \\\" the Tribunal to make findings on any and every matter of fact objectively material to the decision \\\" being reached, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ concluded: \\n [68] Section 430 does not expressly impose such an obligation. In its terms, it requires no more than that the Tribunal set out the findings which it did make. Neither expressly nor impliedly does this section require the Tribunal to make , and then set out, some findings additional to those which it actually made. In Singh , significance was attached to the use of the word \\\"material\\\" in s 430(1)(c). It was said [2000] FCA 845 ; ((2000) 98 FCR 469 at 481 [47] - [48] ) that \\\"material\\\" in the expression \\\"Material questions of fact\\\" must mean \\\"objectively material\\\". Even if that were right, it would by no means follow that the Tribunal was bound to set out findings that it did not make. But it is not right to read \\\"material\\\" as providing an objective or external standard of materiality. A requirement to set out findings and reasons focuses upon the subjective thought processes of the decision-maker. All that s 430(1)(c) obliges the Tribunal to do is set out its findings on those questions of fact which it considered to be material to the decision which it made and to the reasons it had for reaching that decision. \\n\\n \\n [69] It is not necessary to read s 430 as implying an obligation to make findings in order for it to have sensible work to do. Understanding s 430 as obliging the Tribunal to set out what were its findings on the questions of fact it considered material gives the section important work to do in connection with judicial review of decisions of the Tribunal. It ensures that a person who is dissatisfied with the result at which the Tribunal has arrived can identify with certainty what reasons the Tribunal had for reaching its conclusion and what facts it considered material to that conclusion. Similarly, a court which is asked to review the decision is able to identify the Tribunal's reasons and the findings it made in reaching that conclusion. The provision entitles a court to infer that any matter not mentioned in the s 430 statement was not considered by the Tribunal to be material. This may reveal some basis for judicial review by the Federal Court under Pt 8 of the Act, or by this Court in proceedings brought under s 75(v) of the Constitution . For example, it may reveal that the Tribunal made some error of law of the kind mentioned in s 476(1)(e) of the Act, such as incorrectly applying the law to the facts found by the Tribunal. It may reveal jurisdictional error. The Tribunal's identification of what it considered to be the material questions of fact may demonstrate that it took into account some irrelevant consideration or did not take into account some relevant consideration. (Emphasis in original) \\n\\n \\nThe same construction was given to s 430 by the then Chief Justice: [2001] HCA 30 at [10] , [2001] HCA 30 ; 206 CLR 323 at 331 to 332. Whatever uncertainty may have prevailed prior to Yusuf, notwithstanding the unambiguous terms of s 430, there now remains no uncertainty as to the proper construction of s 430 or the requirements imposed: eg.

Paramount among them is the fact that inconsistency in the treatment of those amenable to the law involves an element of injustice. Particularly where there is competition or correlativity between rights, advantages, obligations and disadvantages, equality of treatment under the law is an ingredient of modern concepts of justice and the rule of law. It is important that those who constitute the Tribunal should, in their search for the correct or preferable decision in the particular case, be entitled to pay regard both to decisions of the Tribunal in other matters and to policies enunciated and developed by those entrusted with the primary administration of the relevant law. \\n\\n \\n On the other hand, while consistency may properly be seen as an ingredient of justice, it does not constitute a hallmark of it. As Smithers J pointed out in Gungor and Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [Unreported (Administrative Appeals Tribunal, 30 th May 1980)] consistency must ultimately be related to policy and is safely sought by reference to policy only when the policy is appropriate and acceptable. Decision makers may be consistently wrong and consistently unjust. The Tribunal is not bound by either its own previous decisions or by the content of government policy. There have been and will be cases in which the Tribunal concludes that it should refuse to follow a previous decision of the Tribunal or reject or disregard the dictates of a relevant policy of the government. The existence of such cases serves to emphasize the fact that each applicant to the Tribunal is entitled to have his or her application for review decided on its own particular merits. The desire for consistency should not be permitted to submerge the ideal of justice in the individual case.\\n\\n\\\" Consistency \\\" is thus not an end in itself a like result reached upon the basis of factually diverse materials may be the hallmark of injustice and not justice. The task of the administrator is to resolve a case upon the materials presently available and in accordance with law.\",\"11\":\"As noted by Brennan J, when he was President of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, in Re Drake and Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1979) 2 ALD 634 at 639: \\n Inconsistency is not merely inelegant: it brings the process of deciding into disrepute, suggesting an arbitrariness which is incompatible with commonly accepted notions of justice. \\n\\n \\nThis passage has, not surprisingly, been repeatedly cited: e.g. Apthorpe v Repatriation Commission (1987) 13 ALD 656 at 665 per Davies, Lockhart and Gummow JJ; Pepaj v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (unreported, FCA, Merkel J, SG 101 of 1998, 25 November 1998); Re Confidential and Australian Prudential Regulation Authority [2005] AATA 1264 at [22] , [2005] AATA 1264 ; 91 ALD 435 at 439; SZFYW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1259 at [11] .

There is authority for the proposition that the Tribunal is not to limit its determination to the 'case' articulated by an applicant if evidence and material which it accepts raise a case not articulated \\u2014 Paramananthan v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [1998] FCA 1693 ; (1998) 94 FCR 28 at 63 (Merkel J); approved in Sellamuthu v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1802 ; (1999) 90 FCR 287 at 293 294 (Wilcox and Madgwick JJ). By way of example, if a claim of apprehended persecution is based upon membership of a particular social group the Tribunal may be required in its review function to consider a group definition open on the facts but not expressly advanced by the applicant \\u2014 Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Sarrazola (No 2) [2001] FCA 263 ; (2001) 107 FCR 184 at 196 per Merkel J, Heerey and Sundberg JJ agreeing. It has been suggested that the unarticulated claim must be raised 'squarely' on the material available to the Tribunal before it has a statutory duty to consider it \\u2014 SDAQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 120 ; (2003) 199 ALR 265 at 273 [19] per Cooper J. The use of the adverb 'squarely' does not convey any precise standard but it indicates that a claim not expressly advanced will attract the review obligation of the Tribunal when it is apparent on the face of the material before the Tribunal. Such a claim will not depend for its exposure on constructive or creative activity by the Tribunal. \\n\\n \\n [59] There is some authority which might be taken to suggest that the Tribunal is never required to consider a claim not expressly raised before it. ... \\n\\n \\n [60] In SGBB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 709 ; (2003) 199 ALR 364 at 368 [17] , Selway J referred to the observation by Kirby J in Dranichniko v, at 405, that '[t]he function of the Tribunal, as of the delegate, is to respond to the case that the applicant advances'. He also referred to the observation by von Doussa J in SCAL v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 548 that '[n]either the delegate nor the Tribunal is obliged to consider claims that have not been made' (at [16]). Selway J however went on to observe in SGBB (at [17]): \\n\\n \\nBut this does not mean the application is to be treated as an exercise in 19th Century pleading.\\n \\n \\n His Honour noted that the Full Court in Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1801 at [49] had said: \\n\\n \\nThe Tribunal must, of course, deal with the case raised by the material and evidence before it. An asylum claimant does not have to pick the correct Convention \\\"label\\\" to describe his or her plight, but the Tribunal can only deal with the claims actually made.\\n \\n \\n His Honour, in our view, correctly stated the position when he said (at [18]): \\n\\n \\nThe question, ultimately, is whether the case put by the appellant before the tribunal has sufficiently raised the relevant issue that the tribunal should have dealt with it. \\n \\nThis does not mean that the Tribunal is only required to deal with claims expressly articulated by the applicant. It is not obliged to deal with claims which are not articulated and which do not clearly arise from the materials before it.\\n \\n \\n [61] ... We are of the view that the observations by Merkel J in Paramananthan , by the Full Courts in Sellamuthu and Sarrazola (No 2) and by Cooper J in SDAQ are consistent with the proposition that the Tribunal is not required to consider a case that is not expressly made or does not arise clearly on the materials before it. The Tribunal's obligation is not limited to procedural fairness in responding to expressly articulated claims but, as is apparent from Dranichnikov , extends to reviewing the delegate's decision on the basis of all the materials before it. \\n\\n \\n [62] Whatever the scope of the Tribunal's obligations it is not required to consider criteria for an application never made. ... \\n\\n \\nIn MZXLB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1588 at [14] , Finkelstein J referred to NABE and observed that \\\" (t)here is no precise standard for determining when an issue is 'raised squarely', but it is clear the tribunal is obliged to consider any claim that is apparent on the face of the material before it \\\".
