It has been doubted, in any event, whether this Court can entertain an appeal from a decision to dismiss an application for want of appearance: see the judgments of Sundberg J in MZWIK v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 185 (\\\" MZWIK \\\") and VOAQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1505.\\n\\n12 Rather than proceeding under s 25(2B)(bb)(ii), I propose to adopt the course taken by Sundberg J in MZWIK , and consider whether there is sufficient merit in the appeal to justify the grant of leave. This seems preferable where the course the applicant should have taken is to make an application in the Federal Magistrates' Court under r 16.05(2).\\n\\n13 I cannot see any basis for impugning O'Dwyer FM's decision. It is clear that his Honour has the power to dismiss an application for non-appearance of an applicant, and nothing in the notice of appeal evinces any irregularity in the exercise of that power. The applicant's non-appearance before O'Dwyer FM remains unexplained. In these circumstances, the appeal has no prospect of success.\\n\\n14 Accordingly, I order that leave to appeal be refused, the notice of appeal dated 28 November 2005 be struck out as incompetent, and the applicant pay the respondents' costs.\\n \\n\\n I certify that the preceding fourteen (14) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Young. \\n\\n\\nAssociate:\\n\\n\\nDated: 9 March 2006\\n\\n\\n Counsel for the Applicant: No appearance \\n \\n Solicitor for the Respondents: Ms M.
