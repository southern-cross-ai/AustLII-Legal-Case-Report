I found that the applicant's claim was entirely without merit and fraudulent. I gave the applicant leave to file written submissions within seven days to show cause why costs should not be on an indemnity basis.\\n\\n2 The applicant filed three submissions, each bearing the date 16 October, although they were in fact filed later.\\n\\n3 Essentially the applicant's arguments against indemnity costs were based on his status as an unrepresented litigant who was not legally qualified. He made various complaints about the substantive merits of my decision and alleged procedural injustices, but I do not see that as relevant for present purposes.\",\"1\":\"4 Section 43(2) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) gives the Court a wide discretion to award costs in a proceeding.
