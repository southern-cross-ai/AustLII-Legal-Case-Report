In substance, it was held in that case that where a beneficiary is absolutely and indefeasibly entitled to a trust asset as against the trustee, the beneficiary is entitled to terminate the trust and require the trustee to transfer the asset to him or her or at his or her direction. In order to invoke the rule, multiple beneficiaries can come together so that their beneficial interests exhaust the beneficial entitlement to the asset. For example, the rule could be invoked by a life tenant and the remainder man: since their interests in combination exhaust the beneficial interest in the subject property, in combination they are entitled to direct the trustee to transfer the property as they will.\\n\\n60 In Public Curator of Queensland v Union Trustee Company of Australia Ltd [1922] HCA 28 ; (1922) 31 CLR 66 at 74, Higgins J noted:\\n Those who are solely and absolutely entitled to receive money from trustees are entitled to ignore the specific mode and time of payment directed by the testator, to \\\"break the trust\\\", as it is called, and to claim immediate payment without the delay and formalities prescribed by the will (Saunders v Vautier (1841) 4 Beav. 115 ; Cr & Ph., 240, Harbin v Masterman (1894) 2 Ch. 184; (1895) A.C. 186 , and other cases).\\n\\n62 It will be noted that unlike the position under the rule in Saunders v Vautier , subs (5) of s 104-55 and of s 104-60 applies only to trusts of which there is a \\\"sole beneficiary\\\". Moreover, the provision requires the sole beneficiary to be absolutely entitled \\\"to the asset\\\" over which the trust was created. In the present case, the asset over which the trust was created was Helen's half interest in the Property.\\n\\n63 It is sufficient to say in relation to the absolute entitlement aspect that cll 34.12(b) and (c) are fatal to the applicants' cases.
