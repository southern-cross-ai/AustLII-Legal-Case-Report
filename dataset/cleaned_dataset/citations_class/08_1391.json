In that case the Court had before it for consideration the provisions of Pt 5.3A of the Corporations Law, the predecessor of the present Pt 5.3A of the Act which, for all relevant purposes, was in the same form as the current Pt 5.3A. The administrators of a group of companies had sought declarations as to which creditors of a company were bound by the deed of company arrangement. The relevant enquiry focused on s 444D of the Corporations Law. The Court said at 31-32:\\n \\\"In our opinion, the reference to 'all creditors' in s.444D(1) must be read and understood in the context of all other references to \\\"creditors\\\" in Pt.5.3A. What has so far been described is sufficient to show that the general scheme of the Part is to involve the company's creditors, without further limitation or description. The word \\\"creditors\\\" should, in the absence of any good reason otherwise, be read as used in the same sense throughout Pt.5.3A, and it is difficult to suppose that sections, drawn so widely as, for instance, s.435A (describing the object of the Part) had in mind anything less than all of the creditors for the time being of the company.\\\" \\n\\nThe Court said further at 33:\\n \\\"Once it is decided, for the reasons we have given, that the expression 'all creditors' in s.444D(1) should not be confined to those having claims for money sums due and payable on or before the day specified in the deed, we see no alternative but to treat the creditors of the company for the purposes of Pt.5.3A as those who would have been creditors had the company gone into liquidation and the relevant date for the purposes of s.553 been the day specified in the deed.\\\"\\n\\n38 The reasoning in Brash Holdings Limited (Administrator appointed) v Katile Pty Ltd (supra) was adopted and followed in Selim v McGrath (2003) 177 FLR 85. Barrett J considered that for the purposes of s 439A creditors in a voluntary administration under Pt 5.3A of the Act were all persons who had debts or claims against a company provable in its winding up and said, at 105:\\n \\\"The boundaries are therefore those set by s 553(1) which refers to 'all debts payable by, and all claims against, the company (present or future, certain or contingent, ascertained or sounding only in damages) ...\\\".\",\"1\":\"38 The reasoning in Brash Holdings Limited (Administrator appointed) v Katile Pty Ltd (supra) was adopted and followed in Selim v McGrath (2003) 177 FLR 85.

In Mondello Farms Pty Ltd v Annatom Pty Ltd (supra), Layton J said at [114]:\\n \\\"In determining whether a deed is oppressive or unfairly prejudicial or unfairly discriminatory, the background of the general principles underlying Pt 5.3A of the Act must be considered. A creditor has the basic right to payment, to the winding up of a company, or to the administration of the company in a manner that keeps the business of the company going which ultimately resulting [sic] in the creditor receiving payment out of the property of the company. The court will look at the whole of the effect of the deed and assess 'its unfairness, if any, to the plaintiff creditor bearing in mind the scheme of Pt 5.3A , the interests of the other creditors, the company and the public generally'. It is necessary to consider the total circumstances of the case so as to determine whether there is overall unfairness.\\\" [footnotes omitted]. \\n\\nIn the circumstances of the present case, the last sentence of this quotation is critical.\\n\\n55 The plaintiff's case, in essence, was that effect could not be given to the Deed without injustice and that the Deed was oppressive, prejudicial to and discriminatory against creditors because of the amount for which the land is to be sold pursuant to the Deed of Company Arrangement. Although the Administrators had received an independent valuation of the land which provided a valuation of $5.93 million net of rectification costs, the Administrators had set out in their report factors which made it problematic whether such a value could be received on the sale of the land. Having regard to the circumstances and factors set out in the Administrators' report, I do not consider that effect cannot be given to the Deed without injustice. It is the plaintiff who is complaining about the injustice but I do not consider that there is any injustice to the plaintiff in circumstances where in a context and with the background to which I referred, the creditors, by a majority of number and value, have decided to go the route of deed of company arrangement rather than liquidation.\\n\\n56 The assumptions and factors identified by the Administrators required the creditors to make a choice. The choice they made did not result in a Deed which was oppressive to, or prejudicial to, or discriminatory against the general body of creditors, and the plaintiff in particular, having regard to the factors which had to be taken into account in determining whether what the Administrators called either a high scenario, a medium scenario or a low scenario in terms of return to creditors might be achieved.\"}}"
