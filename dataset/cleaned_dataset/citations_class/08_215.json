An appeal to the Federal Court under section 44 is available in relation to a non-privative clause decision.\",\"1\":\"20 Section 483 is clear in its terminology and meaning. The amendments to the Migration Act in the Migration Legislation Amendment (Judicial Review) Act 2001 (Cth) and the 2005 Act do not remove a right of judicial review of Tribunal decisions. They confer jurisdiction on the Federal Magistrates Court to review those migration decisions for which jurisdiction is not conferred on the Federal Court by s 476A and to place statutory limits on a statutory right of appeal. Justice Besanko observed in Epenisa v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural Affairs (2007) 44 AAR 456 at [11], on the subject of the limitation imposed by s 483 of the Migration Act , that s 44 of the AAT Act is a statutory right of appeal and ' there is nothing to prevent Parliament from excluding from its purview a certain class of decision '.\\n\\n21 Clause 51 of the Revised Explanatory Memorandum to the Migration Legislation Amendment (Judicial Review) Bill 2001 concerns the proposed s 483. It says:\\n \\n Section 483 Section 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 \\n \\n 51 Section 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 allows for appeals from the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to the Federal Court on a point of law. New section 483 prevents section 44 from applying to a privative clause decision. Therefore, an application to the Federal Court in respect of such a decision needs to be made under section 39B of the Judiciary Act .\\n\\n26 There have, however, been other decisions of the Court where the effect of s 483 has been considered on appeal from the Tribunal and in the context of business visa decisions. In Li-Shien Chen v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 1496 at [2] [3] Drummond J noted that it was common ground that that the Tribunal's decision was a privative clause decision and that an appeal against the Tribunal's decision to the Court under s 44 of the AAT Act was not available because of s 483 of the Migration Act (as it was, prior to the 2005 Act). In Jong Hak Kim v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 31 ; (2004) 38 AAR 304 , also concerning a business visa decision, Kiefel J noted at [26] that it had been submitted by the Minister that the Court's jurisdiction was under s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) and not s 44 of the AAT Act because of s 483 of the Migration Act . Her Honour did not reject that submission but did not consider it further. In SHCB v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 308 ; (2003) 133 FCR 561 , not a business visa case, the Full Court held at [5] that, if the Tribunal decision was a privative clause decision, there was no right of appeal under s 44 of the AAT Act by reason of the operation of s 483. In Epenisa , Besanko J considered the Court's jurisdiction in an appeal from the Tribunal decision. Noting that the Court had jurisdiction under s 39B of the Judiciary Act and under ss 476A(1)(b) or (c) of the Migration Act , his Honour observed at [8] that there was no right of appeal under s 44 of the AAT Act because of s 483 of the Migration Act .\",\"2\":\"26 There have, however, been other decisions of the Court where the effect of s 483 has been considered on appeal from the Tribunal and in the context of business visa decisions.

The applicant accepts that neither decision canvassed the effect of s 483, although other aspects of the Court's jurisdiction were discussed. It is likely that the effect of that section on jurisdiction was simply not raised for consideration. In any event, there was no determination that the Court did have jurisdiction despite s 483 of the Migration Act .\",\"4\":\"26 There have, however, been other decisions of the Court where the effect of s 483 has been considered on appeal from the Tribunal and in the context of business visa decisions.

He submits that, as there is no specific reference to business visa decisions, they are not encompassed by s 483. The applicant submits that, if the intention of Parliament was to remove an existing right of appeal to the Federal Court on a question of law in relation to business visa decisions, this would have been clearly stated ( Plaintiff S157\\/2002 v Commonwealth of Australia (2003) 211 CLR 476 at [32] per Gleeson CJ and at [72] per Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ). The correct interpretation is, he submits, that s 476A in combination with s 483 limits judicial review of migration decisions but not the right of appeal on a question of law, particularly in relation to business visa decisions by the Tribunal. He submits that, read together, s 483 only applies to the class of decisions referred to in s 476A.\\n\\n19 There are a number of responses to this submission. Again, there is no differentiation between the subject matter of privative clause decisions or purported privative clause decisions in s 483 and there is no reason to isolate business visa decisions. Parliament chose not to refer to business visa decisions in s 476A and chose to deal globally with privative and purported privative clause decisions in s 483. Further, s 483 makes no reference to s 476A. It does not, for example, commence with the words \\\"on review under s 500\\\". There is no reason to read s 483 as if those words were included so that only decisions the subject of s 476A(1) were excluded from an appeal to the Federal Court under s 44 of the AAT Act. To do so would be to ignore the clear words of s 483 and the note.\\n\\n22 It is apparent that the intention was that s 483 apply to all appeals from privative clause decisions. Section 483 was then amended in the 2005 Act ('the 2005 amendments'), presumably because of decisions such as S157 ( Bodruddaza v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural Affairs [2007] HCA 14 ; (2007) 228 CLR 651 at [19] ).

This provides that section 44 of the AAT Act does not apply to privative clause decisions or purported privative clause decisions (inserted by item 14, Schedule 1). Section 44 of the AAT Act provides that a person may appeal a decision of the AAT on a point of law to the Federal Court. An appeal to the Federal Court under section 44 is available in relation to a non-privative clause decision.\",\"6\":\"26 There have, however, been other decisions of the Court where the effect of s 483 has been considered on appeal from the Tribunal and in the context of business visa decisions. In Li-Shien Chen v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 1496 at [2] [3] Drummond J noted that it was common ground that that the Tribunal's decision was a privative clause decision and that an appeal against the Tribunal's decision to the Court under s 44 of the AAT Act was not available because of s 483 of the Migration Act (as it was, prior to the 2005 Act).

In Epenisa , Besanko J considered the Court's jurisdiction in an appeal from the Tribunal decision. Noting that the Court had jurisdiction under s 39B of the Judiciary Act and under ss 476A(1)(b) or (c) of the Migration Act , his Honour observed at [8] that there was no right of appeal under s 44 of the AAT Act because of s 483 of the Migration Act .\",\"7\":\"12 The note supports the interpretation that s 483 bears on its face, that the section excludes an appeal under s 44 of the AAT Act for privative clause decisions and purported privative clause decisions ( Sneddon v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs (2005) 88 ALD 84 at [3]). The applicant does not contend to the contrary.\\n\\n13 Thus, s 476A(1)(d) confers jurisdiction on the Federal Court in relation to such appeals from the Tribunal as can continue to arise under the Migration Act , given the limitation imposed by s 483. The Federal Court has jurisdiction to undertake judicial review of Tribunal decisions under the Migration Act where the decision on review is a privative clause decision or a purported privative clause decision under s 500 of the Migration Act , or a non-privative clause decision the subject of an appeal under s 44(3) of the AAT Act, or a referral by the Tribunal under s 45(2) of the AAT Act.\\n\\n14 The Federal Magistrates Court has jurisdiction to undertake judicial review of any other decision of the Tribunal in relation to a migration decision, including the decision of the Tribunal in this case (s 476 of the Migration Act ). Symmetrically, s 476(2) provides that the Federal Magistrates Court does not have jurisdiction in relation to decisions described as in s 476A(1). The applicant is, however, out of time to make an application to the Federal Magistrates Court.\\n\\n15 To overcome this result, the applicant makes a number of submissions.\\n\\n16 First, he submits that as s 483 of the Migration Act does not specifically refer to business visas, they are excluded from the ambit of that section. I reject that submission. Section 483 does not refer to any particular category of privative clause decision or purported privative clause decision. There is no reason to put business visas into a special category.\",\"8\":\"25 The applicant also relies on two decisions of the Court which considered appeals on a question of law under s 44 of the AAT Act from business visa decisions of the Tribunal, Koosasi v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural Affairs (2006) 43 AAR 462 and Yang v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1159. The applicant accepts that neither decision canvassed the effect of s 483, although other aspects of the Court's jurisdiction were discussed. It is likely that the effect of that section on jurisdiction was simply not raised for consideration. In any event, there was no determination that the Court did have jurisdiction despite s 483 of the Migration Act .\"}}"
