Facts relevant to facts in issue emerge from the particulars and the evidence. The function of particulars is not to expand the issues defined by the pleadings, but \\\"to fill in the picture of the plaintiff's cause of action with information sufficiently detailed to put the defendant on his guard as to the case he has to meet and to enable him to prepare for trial\\\" ( Bruce v Odhams Press Ltd [1936] 1 KB 697 at 712-13). \\n Particulars of the Representations pleaded in paras 19, 21A, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 and 29 of the ASC\\n\\n72 In relation to each of the Representations pleaded in the paragraphs identified, ANZ seeks an order that the applicants specify:\\n \\n \\n (a) whether the Representation is alleged to have been made orally; and\\n (b) if it is alleged that the Representation was made orally;\\n (i) when it was made;\\n (ii) by whom it was made; \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n (iii) to whom it was made; \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n (c) whether the Representation is alleged to have been of a present fact or as to an opinion.\\n\\n73 I do not think that ANZ is entitled to require the applicants to categorise the alleged Representations as being as to present fact or as to an opinion. No doubt, there will be submissions on the final hearing as to the proper characterisation of particular Representations for the purpose of s 51A of the TP Act and s 12BB of the ASIC Act , but I do not think that characterisation at this stage is necessary in order to enable ANZ to file its defence.\",\"3\":\"66 In principle there is no difficulty in the applicants complaining that, having been induced by ANZ's misleading or deceptive conduct to enter into the Transaction, they lost all the money they paid at the time of doing so, and there is no difficulty in the applicants seeking to recover that money with interest, whether based on Hungerfords v Walker [1989] HCA 8 ; (1989) 171 CLR 125 or otherwise. However, the ASC should plead facts showing that the applicants claim that they got nothing in return for the money paid. It is not suggested, for example, that Newco did not become legally indebted to Geomar for the sum of $4,055,556 which it lent to Newco on 1 May 2003. I presume that immediately following the loan, Newco was able to repay it. Some facts to the effect that Newco ceased to be able to repay the loan at some time should be pleaded. \\n The amounts claimed by the applicants\\n\\n67 Paras 56 and 57 of the ASC set out the amounts claimed by \\\"the Chapmans\\\" (the ASC uses that expression to refer to the applicants). ANZ complains that para 57 of the ASC is embarrassing because it asserts that the applicants, without distinguishing between them, claim the amount of $13,183,682.38.\\n\\n68 In their submissions, the applicants reply that the letter dated 21 November 2007 from Atanaskovic Hartnell, coupled with the Substitute Table (that is annexed to these reasons for judgment), adequately identifies the amounts claimed by the respective applicants.\",\"4\":\"39 I will not discuss the legal principles governing the adequacy of a pleading: I discussed them in Collex Waste Management Pty Ltd v Waste Recycling & Processing Service of New South Wales [1999] FCA 213 and Australian Automotive Repairers' Association (Political Action Committee) Inc v NRMA Insurance Ltd [2002] FCA 1568.

In each case, it is said that in so far as the Representations in question were oral, they were made in \\\"a conversation\\\", \\\"a discussion\\\", \\\"various discussions\\\" or \\\"several discussions\\\", between a named person on behalf of ANZPE and one or more named persons on behalf of the applicants. As well, either a particular date or a confined period is stated.\\n\\n80 I do not think that ANZ needs more to enable it to file its defence. \\n Particulars of falsity subparagraphs of para 29D of the ASC\"}}"
