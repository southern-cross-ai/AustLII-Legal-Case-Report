On 18 June 2009 Deputy District Registrar Cujes made orders that: \\n \\n 1. The full taxation proceed on the basis there exists a valid retainer agreement between the First Respondent (Mr Rickus) and his legal representatives for the purposes of the proceedings. \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n 2. The First Respondent is granted leave, pursuant to Order 13 sub-rule 2(1) of the Federal Court Rules , to file and serve an amended bill of costs. \\n \\n\\n \\nThose orders were accompanied by a letter from the Deputy District Registrar also dated 18 June 2009 to the solicitors for both the Trustee and Mr Rickus. The letter recorded (in part) what the Deputy District Registrar referred to as her \\\" preliminary oral decision ... in respect of ... the validity of \\\" a written retainer as between Mr Rickus and his legal advisers. The letter helpfully recorded a finding that \\\" the retainer between Mr Rickus and his lawyers was partly oral, partly written and\\/or partly to be implied by conduct \\\". Reference was made by the Deputy District Registrar to s 42 of the Legal Practitioners Act 1981 (SA) and to a decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia in Catto v Hampton Australia Ltd (In Liq) [2008] SASC 231. That decision was relied upon as authority for the proposition that \\\" a successful litigant is entitled to recover from the other party amounts paid by the former in connection with the litigation, notwithstanding the unenforceability of any agreement between the litigant and solicitor... \\\". The letter concluded:\\n \\n \\n I would continue to strongly urge the parties to attend a confidential conference or mediation with a view to, at the very least, narrowing and refining the issues in dispute, but hopefully reaching settlement on a commercial basis.\\n\\nThe Trustee's application for review invokes O 62 r 11 of the Federal Court Rules which provides as follows: \\n \\n Every taxation of costs and every decision of a taxing officer shall be subject to review by a Judge.\\n\\nIn summary form, the Trustee seeks to contend that: the Deputy District Registrar's decision is beyond power; and is, in any event wrong as a matter of law. \\nCounsel for Mr Rickus contends that:\",\"3\":\"It may presently be assumed that O 62 r 11 has been properly invoked.
