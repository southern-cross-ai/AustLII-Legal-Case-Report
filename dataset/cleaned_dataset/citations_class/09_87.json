Accordingly, the existence of any such agreement would be a significant matter to HID in its determination of whether it should commence the foreshadowed litigation. Further, any correspondence between Keycorp and Gemalto which might indicate that Keycorp treats the exclusivity agreement to be at an end could also be of significance for such purpose. Any written memorandum or record, for example of a telephone conversation, between Keycorp and Gemalto relating to the termination of such exclusivity agreement in the relevant period, namely between 4 August 2008 and 25 August 2008, would serve the same purpose.\\n\\nThe Court does not regard the claim for preliminary discovery as being one designed to strengthen or enhance the decision to commence proceedings. No such decision has yet been made, although HID has grounds for believing that it may be entitled to make a claim under the Trade Practices Act and possibly under promissory estoppel. The documents are sought for the purpose of providing sufficient information to enable a decision whether to make a claim. In this respect, any documents of the kind referred to in subparagraph 1(d) of the Application could be relevant.\\n\\nThe Court is satisfied that HID does not have sufficient information to institute proceedings. The present circumstances are accordingly different to those considered by Lindgren J in Alphafarm .\\n\\nFor the above reasons, the Court grants the application for preliminary discovery, in respect of the documents referred to in paragraphs 1(a), (b), (c) and (d) of the application.\\n I certify that the preceding forty-seven (47) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Cowdroy. \\n \\n Associate:\\n \\n \\nDated: 13 February 2009\\n \\n Counsel for the Applicant: Mr Kidd \\n \\n Solicitor for the Applicant: Allens Arthur Robinson \\n \\n Counsel for the Respondent: Mr Fleming QC with Mr McGrath \\n \\n Solicitor for the Respondent: Henry Davis York \\n Date of Hearing: 17 December 2008 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 13 February 2009 \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2009\\/87.html\",\"1\":\"The necessity to make enquiries from other sources was considered by Tamberlin J in CGU Insurance Ltd and Others v Malaysia International Shipping Corporation Berhad [2001] FCA 1223 ; (2001) 187 ALR 279 at [23] - [27] . At [25] his Honour said: \\n The provision does not contemplate an order where some reasonable inquiries have been made but rather where all reasonable inquiries have been made. It appears to contemplate a reasonable exhaustion of alternative sources of information and, in any particular case, involves a pragmatic balancing of considerations. The power of the Court arises after the applicant has made all reasonable inquiries and finds that there is insufficient information to enable a decision to be made.\\n\\nThere is no evidence of any attempts made by HID to ascertain from Gemalto whether the exclusivity arrangement existed. However, the question is whether it is reasonable to expect that HID would, prior to commencing litigation, inquire of Gemalto whether it held an exclusivity arrangement. That is, whether it was reasonable to expect that it would ask its competitor to provide information which relates solely to a commercial transaction made between Gemalto and Keycorp, in respect of which HID was an unsuccessful bidder.\\n\\nThe Court is not persuaded that it was reasonable for HID, a commercial competitor of Gemalto, to have made such inquiries of Gemalto concerning the existence of any exclusivity arrangement between Gemalto and Keycorp. Therefore, such an inquiry was not necessary to satisfy the first requirement of O 15A r 6(b), namely that HID make 'all reasonable inquiries .
