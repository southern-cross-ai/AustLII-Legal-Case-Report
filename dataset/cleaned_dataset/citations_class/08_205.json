See generally Jianshe Southern Pty Ltd v Get Motor Cycles Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 1078.\\n\\n7 I am satisfied the application for security was brought promptly.\\n\\n14 The word \\\"oppressive\\\" is used in this area to describe an application for security that is used merely to deny an impecunious applicant a right to litigate.

Many of the grounds are not available grounds of appeal or are of such generality and so wanting in particularity that they are impossible to assess. The complaint about the Magistrate's construction of Order 36 of the Federal Court Rules was rejected by Tracey J in Maher v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2007] FCA 560 at [9] .\\n\\n9 There is no material before me to support the claim that the Magistrate denied the applicant procedural fairness.\\n\\n10 The complaint that the respondent's demand for payment should have been on behalf of all parties jointly entitled to costs, and that each should have been named in the notice for that purpose, was dealt with by the Magistrate at [32] to [35] of his reasons. On the evidence before him the Magistrate found that the respondent was authorised to collect all of the costs on behalf of the other parties.\",\"2\":\"14 The word \\\"oppressive\\\" is used in this area to describe an application for security that is used merely to deny an impecunious applicant a right to litigate.
