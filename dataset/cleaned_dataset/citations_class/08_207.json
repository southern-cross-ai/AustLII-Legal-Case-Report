This ground was not raised expressly before the Tribunal nor was material presented by the appellant which made it necessary for the Tribunal to consider and determine the issue. Even if it be assumed, in the appellant's favour, that a particular social group of the kind identified by counsel existed, the Tribunal's findings that the appellant had not been subject to conduct which amounted to persecution means that she does not satisfy the Convention definition of a \\\"refugee\\\". If she was not persecuted the question of the reason for any alleged persecution does not arise. It cannot, therefore, be said that the Tribunal's failure to deal with the issue meant that a claim which might have been dispositive of the application had been ignored: see NABE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2004] FCAFC 263 ; (2004) 144 FCR 1 at [63] . In any event this was not a ground that was argued before the Federal Magistrate. I note also that, when asked by the Tribunal whether she knew of any other women who had a similar problem to her in Thailand, she answered that she did not.\\n\\n22 The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\\n I certify that the preceding twenty-two (22) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Tracey. \\n\\n\\n Associate:\\n\\nDated: 3 March 2008\\n\\n\\n Counsel for the Appellant: Mr J A Patel \\n \\n Counsel for the Respondent: Ms E Latif \\n \\n Solicitor for the Respondent: Clayton Utz \\n \\n Date of Hearing: 3 March 2008 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 3 March 2008 \\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2008\\/207.html\"}}"
