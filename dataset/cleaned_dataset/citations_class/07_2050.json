It must be remembered that the focus of the appellant's claim was that Jihadists were pursuing him at the instigation of his uncle. The Tribunal clearly rejected that claim. It rejected the appellant's assertion that there had been five incidents involving the appellant and Jihadists in Kano in 2002 and it rejected the assertion that Jihadists were searching for him. It rejected his explanation for travelling to Kano in June 2004 in light of his evidence that Jihadists were pursuing him as \\\"far fetched and implausible\\\". Any suggestion that the Tribunal was not entitled to make those findings on the evidence must be rejected.\\n\\n32 Once the appellant's claim that he was being pursued by Jihadists at the instigation of his uncle is rejected and (as was the case) in the absence of any evidence or material to support a conclusion that the appellant would be identified by Jihadists as a convert, it was appropriate that the Tribunal consider, as it did, the general situation in Nigeria and, in particular, the fact that half of the country's population is Christian. In other words, it was appropriate for the Tribunal at that point to consider whether the appellant would or may face persecution by reason of the fact that he was a Christian.\\n\\n33 I do not think the Tribunal made the error of treating what has happened as decisive in terms of whether there is a well-founded fear of persecution (see the discussion in Appellant S395\\/2002 at 498 [72]-[77]). It dealt with the principal case advanced by the appellant and rejected it. There was no evidence that the appellant's conversion would be discovered and the mere fact that he was a Christian would not give rise to a well-founded fear of persecution.\\n\\n34 Furthermore, I do not think the Tribunal erred in its approach to the appellant's modified behaviour. It is not clear to me whether the Tribunal accepted the appellant's evidence that he had modified his behaviour. It appears that the Tribunal may have proceeded on the basis that even if the appellant had modified his behaviour in Lagos and even if that was because he feared persecution, the fear of persecution was not well-founded. I do not think there is any error in that approach. Once the Tribunal member made the findings she did and in particular once she rejected the appellant's principal claim it was open to her to conclude that even if the appellant genuinely feared persecution the fear was not well-founded.\",\"1\":\"29 There can be no doubt, as the appellant submitted, that the Tribunal was required to review the delegate's decision (s 414) and a failure by the Tribunal to deal with a \\\"substantial, clearly articulated argument relying on established facts\\\" made by an applicant will constitute jurisdictional error because it constitutes a constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction: Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 26 ; (2003) 77 ALJR 1088 at 1092 [24] - [25] per Gummow and Callinan JJ.

If, on the Tribunal's findings, the appellant had a well-founded fear of persecution in Nigeria it was only if he resided in Kano or perhaps other cities or towns in the northern part of Nigeria. He had not done that for about three years prior to his departure from Nigeria. He had a certificate stating that he is a native of Ibadan in Oyo State and the Tribunal member found that there was no reason for him to return to Kano or any of the other northern Islamic states. It is fairly arguable that Kano is not part of the appellant's home area ( Randhawa v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (1994) 52 FCR 437; Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Durairajasingham [2000] HCA 1 ; (1999) 74 ALJR 405 at 410-411 [27] - [28] .\",\"4\":\"16 The Federal Magistrate referred to the Tribunal's reasons and the respective submissions of the parties.

The appellant was a journalist in the Ukraine. He had a well-founded fear of persecution in the city of Chernovtsy. However, the Tribunal held that he could relocate within the Ukraine if he avoided working as a journalist. The High Court said that the Tribunal's approach involved an error of law. Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ said (at 1665-1666 [32]):\\n \\n The effect of the Tribunal's stance was that the appellant was expected to move elsewhere in Ukraine, and live \\\"discreetly\\\" so as not to attract the adverse interest of the authorities in his new location, lest he be further persecuted by reason of his political opinions. By this reasoning the Tribunal sidestepped consideration of what might reasonably be expected of the appellant with respect to his \\\"relocation\\\" in Ukraine. It presents an error of law, going to an essential task of the Tribunal. This was determination of whether the appellant's fear of persecution was \\\"well-founded\\\" in the Convention sense and thus for the purposes of s 36(2) of the Act .\"}}"
