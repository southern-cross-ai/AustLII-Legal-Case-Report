I turn to the basis of common law principles. It is an accepted principle, which has long been established, that a director of a company has a right to inspect the Company's records. What may be in issue is whether there is an absolute right of access to the Company's records, or whether that, in a given case, the court has a discretion to determine whether or not a director should be permitted to have such access. In Edman v Ross (1922) 22 SR (NSW) 351 , Street CJ in Eq said, at 360-361: \\n \\\"A director's right to inspect and take copies of documents belonging to his company is, I think, clear. ... \\n\\n \\n The right to inspect documents and, if necessary, to take copies of them is essential to the proper performance of a director's duties, and, though I am not prepared to say that the Court might not restrain him in the exercise of this right if satisfied affirmatively that his intention was to abuse the confidence reposed in him and materially to injure the company, it is true nevertheless, that its exercise is, generally speaking, not a matter of discretion with the Court and that he cannot be called upon to furnish his reasons before being allowed to exercise it. In the absence of clear proof to the contrary, the Court must assume that he will exercise it for the benefit of his company.\\\"\\n\\nIn Boulos v Carter; Re TARBS World TV Australia Pty Ltd (2005) 220 ALR 572 , Barrett J said at 582: \\n It is unnecessary to go into any detailed analysis of the general law position. The right of a director to inspect company documents, and, if necessary, to take copies of them has long been recognised as one of the rights that general law affords a director for the purpose of enabling him or her to perform the functions and discharge the duties of the office of director. The classic statement of this right appears in a judgment of Street CJ in Eq Edman v Ross .\\\"\\n\\nEdman v Ross (supra) was also followed by De Jersey J, as he then was, in Kriewaldt v Independent Direction Ltd (1996) 14 ACLC 73 , where at 75, his Honour said: \\n \\\"A director obviously has a right of access to company documents to facilitate the performance of his or her duty, and that carries with it a right to make copies. See Edman v Ross and McGee v Sanders [1991] FCA 554 ; (1991) 32 FCR 397 , 405\\\".\\n\\nAs was pointed out by Street CJ in Eq in Edman v Ross (supra) (par [28] above), a limitation on that right might arise if the court was satisfied affirmatively that the director's intention was to abuse the confidence reposed in him and materially to injure the Company.\\n\\nI should point out that on the material before me, I do not consider that I should make a finding that what Mr Campbell proposes, or what his intention is, is to abuse the confidence reposed in him, or to materially injure the Company. I am making no ultimate findings in this proceeding in relation to the substantive issues raised by Mr Campbell and Mr Pursell in their affidavits. This matter has been brought on as a matter of urgency. Neither deponent was cross-examined and any views I express at the moment are tentative, insofar as they relate to findings as to what the particular purpose or intention of the parties, in particular, Mr Campbell, may be.\\n\\nCounsel for the Company submitted that the common law right arises on the basis of a director having access for the purposes of the Company, and that if that access is not sought in the interests of the Company, then the common law right could not be availed of. Counsel for the Company submitted that Mr Campbell wanted access to the proxies delivered to Computershare and to what was called the \\\"live count\\\" to enable him, amongst other matters, to lobby proxy holders and to establish a foundation to challenge votes that may be cast. Counsel for the Company submitted that these purposes related to personal interests.\",\"1\":\"In Conway v Petronious Clothing Co Ltd [1978] 1 WLR 72 , Slade J followed this observation of Street CJ and reached the following conclusions in relation to the nature of the rights of a director to inspect the books of account of a company: \\n \\\"1. The right exists, but it is a right conferred by the common law, and not by statute ... \\n\\n The right of a director to see his company's books of account, which is exercisable both at and outside meetings, is conferred by the common law in order to enable the director to carry out his duties as a director ... \\n The right of a director to inspect the company's books of account must determine upon removal of the director from office. \\n The right not being a statutory right, the court is left with a residue of discretion as to whether or not to order an inspection.\\\"\\n\\nThe only issue which might be controversial is the observation of Slade J in Conway v Petronious Clothing Co Ltd , that the court has a discretion whether or not to allow inspection. In Berlei Hestia (NZ) Ltd v Fernyhough [1980] 2 NZLR 150 , Mahon J rejected the proposition that the court had a discretion whether or not to permit a director to have access to the books of the Company.\",\"2\":\"Slade J also relied upon, and adopted, the observations of North J in Burn v London and South Wales Coal Co (1890) 7 TLR 118 at 119, where North J accepted that a director, in order that he might properly perform his duties, had, from the nature of the case, a right to see all the documents under the control of the Company.\\n\\nEdman v Ross (supra) was also followed by De Jersey J, as he then was, in Kriewaldt v Independent Direction Ltd (1996) 14 ACLC 73 , where at 75, his Honour said: \\n \\\"A director obviously has a right of access to company documents to facilitate the performance of his or her duty, and that carries with it a right to make copies. See Edman v Ross and McGee v Sanders [1991] FCA 554 ; (1991) 32 FCR 397 , 405\\\".\",\"3\":\"The observations of Street CJ in Eq have been followed in subsequent cases. See for example Molomby v Whitehead [1985] FCA 421 ; (1985) 7 FCR 541 at 550, where Beaumont J said: \\n \\\"The right or power of a director of a company or a corporation to inspect corporate material in aid of the proper execution of his fiduciary obligations to advance the interests of the Company or corporation is well recognised.\\\" \\n\\n \\nBeaumont J cited a number of earlier cases in support of this proposition, to which I do not need to refer at this point of time.\",\"4\":\"In Boulos v Carter; Re TARBS World TV Australia Pty Ltd (2005) 220 ALR 572 , Barrett J said at 582: \\n It is unnecessary to go into any detailed analysis of the general law position.

Mahon J said at 163: \\n \\\"The correct construction of the authorities relied upon by Slade J seems to me to be that the right of inspection is unqualified, but that where it is proved that a director is acting or is about to act in breach of his fiduciary duty to the company, and intends to aid that process by inspecting the books, then his right to inspection disappears.\\\" \\n\\n \\n(see Company Directors: Principles of Law and Corporate Governance, Austin, Ford and Ramsay (2005), 193, [4.13]).\\n\\nMahon J also said in Berlei Hestia (NZ) Ltd v Fernyhough (supra): \\n \\\"In other words, in order to restrain a director from exercising his right of access to corporate information, it must be proved, either from his words or conduct, that there in fact exists an intention on the part of the director to use the information not for the benefit of the company and the shareholders but for the benefit, wholly or in part, of a competitor.\\\"\\n\\nI am satisfied, consistently with common law principles, that Mr Campbell should be entitled to have access to, and should be allowed to inspect, all the records of the Company held by Computershare and also the records of the Company that relate to the share issues.\\n\\nI should add that not only should Mr Campbell have that right of access and inspection, also each and every director of the Company should have it. I do not consider on the material before me that it can be said that there is an intention on the part of Mr Campbell to use the information, not for the benefit of the Company and the shareholders but for the benefit wholly or in part of a competitor, adopting the words of Mahon J. Further, I am not satisfied that by having access to those records and inspecting them Mr Campbell is acting, or is about to act, in breach of his fiduciary duty to the Company and intends to aid that process by inspecting the books.\",\"6\":\"Edman v Ross (supra) was also followed by De Jersey J, as he then was, in Kriewaldt v Independent Direction Ltd (1996) 14 ACLC 73 , where at 75, his Honour said: \\n \\\"A director obviously has a right of access to company documents to facilitate the performance of his or her duty, and that carries with it a right to make copies.

His Honour stated at par [29]: \\n \\\"1. The requirement that the applicant is acting in good faith and that the inspection is to be made for a proper purpose expresses a composite notion and the court will determine whether each has been demonstrated by applying an objective test. \\n\\n The onus is on the applicant to demonstrate that he is acting in good faith and that the inspection is for a proper purpose. \\n The section operates where the applicant seeks to protect some specific or personal right by the making of the order. Examples are where a shareholder contemplates proceedings under s 233 of the Corporations Act (the statutory successor of s 320 of the Companies Code)... or where a shareholder reasonably takes the view that a transaction could adversely affect his investment and he seeks to investigate the transaction for the purpose of determining what action he should take ... or where a shareholder seeks to ascertain facts for the purpose of considering a takeover offer... \\n If the applicant's primary or dominant purpose is a proper purpose, it is not to the point that an inspection may be of benefit to the applicant for some other purpose... \\n The rights provided by s 247A should not be regarded as affecting the basic rule of company law that a shareholder should not ordinarily have recourse to the courts to challenge a managerial decision made by or with the approval of the directors. \\n Since every shareholder has a right to apply under the section for an inspection order, it is no answer to an application that, if an order is made, the applicant may acquire information not available to other shareholders and thereby be in a more advantageous position than those shareholders. \\n Applicants do not necessarily lack a proper purpose merely because (a) they are hostile to other directors; or (b) they will, after inspection, have more information than other members. \\n The procedure under s 247A is not intended to be a process as wide-ranging as the process of discovery of documents so that, as a general rule, inspection will be confined to, say, the results of decisions of directors rather than all the documents such as board papers leading to decisions ... I emphasise that this is a general rule. There may be occasions where it is proper to admit inspection of board papers ... \\n Even where an applicant is acting bona fide and has shown a proper purpose, the court has a discretion whether to order inspection. \\n\\\"\\n \\n[citations omitted]\\n\\nFor present purposes I am prepared to accept that the lobbying of proxy holders is a significant purpose of Mr Campbell in seeking access to the Company's books. In other words, I am prepared to accept that there is a doubt as to whether Mr Campbell's primary or dominant purpose is related to the issues arising out of the allotment of shares. I do not forget that the power given under s 247A must depend upon the application by \\\"a member\\\" of the Company. Can it be a proper purpose for a member of the Company to seek access for the purpose of lobbying proxy holders to vote in a particular way to ensure that that member is elected, to or retained on, the board of directors of the Company? I consider that is a proper purpose and I compare, for example, proposition 3 extracted by Debelle J in Acehill Investments Pty Ltd v Incitec Ltd (supra), which I repeat in this context: \\n \\\"The section operates where the applicant seeks to protect some specific or personal right by the making of the order. ... \\n\\n \\n \\\"or where a shareholder reasonably takes the view that a transaction could adversely affect his investment and he seeks to investigate the transaction for the purpose of determining what action he should take.\\\"\\n\\nIt seems to me that it can be a proper purpose for a member of the Company to seek access to proxies, even though he also has another role as a director of the Company, to determine whether he should take any, and if so what, action in support of his aim to remain on the board of directors. Again, borrowing from the doctrine in relation to the common law principles, that purpose is not to abuse the confidence reposed in him as a director or materially to injure the Company.\\n\\nAlthough Mr Campbell posted messages on the Hot Copper website, to which Mr Pursell has referred and which I have summarised in these reasons, those matters again related to the issues of the composition of the board of directors.\"}}"
