First, each of s 12CB(1) and s 12DA(1) of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth) (the Act) prohibits certain conduct by \\\"a person\\\" which, in the absence of any special definition, includes a natural person. As all of the conduct in this case occurred in the Australian Capital Territory, the sections apply according to their terms (s 4(1) together with the definitions of \\\"Territory\\\" and \\\"this jurisdiction\\\" in s 5 of the Act). Second, there is no difficulty in each of the first and second defendants being responsible for the conduct of the first defendant ( Houghton v Arms [2006] HCA 59 ; (2006) 225 CLR 553).\\n\\n4 Section 12CB(1) provides as follows:\\n \\n \\\"A person must not, in trade or commerce, in connection with the supply or possible supply of financial services to a person, engage in conduct that is, in all the circumstances, unconscionable.\\\"\\n\\n5 There is no doubt that what occurred was \\\"in trade or commerce\\\". \\\"Financial service\\\" is defined in s 12BAB of the Act. That, in turn, incorporates the definition of \\\"financial product\\\" in s 12BAA. A \\\"credit facility\\\" (within the meaning of the regulations) is such a product (s 12BAA(7)(k)). Regulation 2B of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Regulations 2001 (Cth) defines \\\"credit facility\\\" in a manner that is apt to pick up what took place between the second defendant, Mr Biega and Pepper Homeloans.\"}}"
