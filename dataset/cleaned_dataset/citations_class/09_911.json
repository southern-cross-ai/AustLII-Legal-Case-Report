In the result, that application was successful: see the reasons for judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court in SZIFJ v Minister for Immigration [2008] FMCA 1170 , delivered 25 August 2008. As a result of that successful challenge, the case was remitted for hearing afresh on the merits in the Tribunal.\",\"1\":\"On 30 December 2008, a differently constituted Tribunal affirmed, once again, the decision of the Minister's delegate not to grant the Appellant a protection visa. A further challenge by way of judicial review proceedings in the Federal Magistrates Court followed. On this occasion, the Appellant was unsuccessful. On 27 May 2009, the Federal Magistrates Court dismissed the Appellant's application for judicial review: see SZIFJ v Minister for Immigration [2009] FMCA 501.\",\"2\":\"In that regard it should not be assumed that these grounds also can be advanced as of right.

The ground of appeal invites me not to follow those decisions. I would only do that if I were persuaded that they are clearly wrong. On its face, the language of s 424AA is eloquent in the contrast between the use of the word \\\"may\\\" in para (a), and the use of the word \\\"must\\\" in para (b). As a matter of construction, it seems to me that para (a) of s 424AA is, indeed, permissive. I am not persuaded, on the basis of that examination, that either of the decisions mentioned should not be followed.\",\"5\":\"The basis upon which the second Tribunal decision was challenged before the Federal Magistrates Court was apprehended bias on the part of the Tribunal.
