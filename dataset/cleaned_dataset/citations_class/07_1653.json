However, the appellant husband himself required an interpreter for the Tribunal hearing and before me. The Federal Magistrate considered this issue and implicitly found that the evidence of the transcript carried out by the appellant husband was not probative. The asserted errors in translation are based on the opinion of a person whose understanding of English was not of a sufficient level to undertake the task of translation.\\n\\n24 To be accepted as having any probative value, evidence would need to be led by a person competent in English and Indonesian to indicate the matters that had been mistranslated or not translated at all.
