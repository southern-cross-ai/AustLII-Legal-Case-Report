On behalf of the Respondent Minister, reference was made to the confined ambit of judicial review available where powers are so conferred: Buck v Bavone [1976] HCA 24 ; (1976) 135 CLR 110. Gibbs J there observed at 118 19: \\n \\n It is not uncommon for statutes to provide that a board or other authority shall or may take certain action if it is satisfied of the existence of certain matters specified in the statute. Whether the decision of the authority under such a statute can be effectively reviewed by the courts will often largely depend on the nature of the matters of which the authority is required to be satisfied. In all such cases the authority must act in good faith; it cannot act merely arbitrarily or capriciously. Moreover, a person affected will obtain relief from the courts if he can show that the authority has misdirected itself in law or that it has failed to consider matters that it was required to consider or has taken irrelevant matters into account. Even if none of these things can be established, the courts will interfere if the decision reached by the authority appears so unreasonable that no reasonable authority could properly have arrived at it. However, where the matter of which the authority is required to be satisfied is a matter of opinion or policy or taste it may be very difficult to show that it has erred in one of these ways, or that its decision could not reasonably have been reached. In such cases the authority will be left with a very wide discretion which cannot be effectively reviewed by the courts.\\n\\n15 In the present extradition process, an issue which assumes significance was the making of an order under s 18. That section provides as follows:\\n \\n Consent to surrender \\n (1) Where: \\n (a) a person is on remand under section 15; and \\n (b) the Attorney-General has given a notice under subsection 16(1) in relation to the person; \\n the person may inform a magistrate that the person consents to being surrendered to the extradition country concerned in relation to the extradition offence, or all of the extradition offences, for which surrender of the person is sought by that country. \\n (2) Where the person informs the magistrate that he or she so consents, the magistrate shall, unless the magistrate has reason to believe that the consent was not given voluntarily: \\n (a) advise the person that the effect of so consenting will be that: \\n \\n \\n (i) the person will be committed to prison without any proceedings being conducted under section 19 to determine whether the person is eligible for surrender in relation to any extradition offence; and \\n (ii) the person will, if the Attorney-General issues a surrender warrant or a temporary surrender warrant, be surrendered to the extradition country; and \\n \\n \\n (b) if, after the person has been advised as mentioned in paragraph (a), the person again consents to being surrendered: \\n \\n \\n (i) by warrant in the statutory form, order that the person be committed to prison to await surrender under a surrender warrant or temporary surrender warrant or release pursuant to an order under subsection 22(5); and \\n (ii) advise the Attorney-General in writing of the offence or the offences in respect of which the person has so consented.\\n\\n16 It is difficult to conclude that the Applicant does not fall within the terms of s 6(a)(i) of the Extradition Act , namely a person in respect of whom there is \\\" a warrant ... in force ... in relation to an offence ... against the law \\\" of Germany.\\n\\n18 The warrant as issued does not on its face disclose any limitation as to the period of time during which it is to operate. The manner of operation of a warrant issued under a foreign law, including any limitation as to the period of time during which it is to operate, is a question of fact. As contended by the Respondent Minister, the existence of the warrant and the absence of any limitation upon its face provided a sound basis upon which the Respondent Minister could lawfully form an \\\" opinion \\\" for the purposes of s 16(2): cf Buck v Bavone . Moreover, the request for extradition, being a document also before the Minister when giving the notice, also proceeds upon the assumption that the warrant issued in September 2003 remained in force when the request was being made in April 2006.\\n\\n27 As at the date when the s 16 notice was given, the material then available provided a sound basis for the requisite \\\" opinion \\\" being formed. A discrete submission advanced on behalf of the Respondent Minister again focused attention upon the confined ambit of such judicial review as is available: Buck v Bavone . Section 16(2)(a)(ii) -- as with s 16(2)(a)(i) -- again vests the decision-making function in the Attorney (or the Minister) if he is \\\" of the opinion \\\" that the person involved has committed an \\\" extradition offence .\\\" That submission is again accepted.\\n\\n28 A contrary conclusion advanced by Mr Karsten was based upon what was said to be a discrepancy between what the German Criminal Code may have provided in terms, and the sentences in fact imposed upon others involved in the events giving rise to the charges against him. That \\\" parity of sentencing \\\" as urged by Mr Karsten dictated a different conclusion. It is considered that the \\\" opinion \\\" formed on 24 October 2006 was one open to be reached by the Minister on the materials before him and one which should be accepted for the purposes of the present Motion .\\n\\n29 Albeit subsequent to the point in time when the s 16 notice was issued on 24 October 2006, it may further be noted that there was no later reason to revisit that conclusion. The \\\" Opinion \\\" provided in April 2007 thus also states in part as follows: \\n \\n ... German police officers are not authorised to make offers to terminate criminal procedures.\\n Additionally, execution of imprisonment may, under Section 56 StPO, only be suspended on probation, when it does not exceed 2 years. In the case concerned here however, the minimum punishment provided by law is 3 years of imprisonment. One could only go below this when other circumstances, which are regulated by law, come up. Such specific circumstances are not recognisable, however. For this reason, probationary suspension of the imprisonment to be imposed when a sentence is passed would, at the current state of knowledge, not be possible ...\",\"4\":\"19 The approach urged upon the Court by Mr Karsten, namely an invitation to go behind the face of both the request and (more importantly) the warrant itself is an invitation which should be rejected. Section 16(2) , framed as it is in terms of an \\\" opinion \\\", should not be construed as requiring the Attorney-General or the Minister to become an expert in foreign law and construed in a manner which has the potential to frustrate the discharge by Australia of its obligations under extradition treaties: Tervonen v Minister for Justice & Customs (No 2) [2007] FCA 1684 , 98 ALD 589.

Relevant to the order made by the magistrate are the following observations of his Honour: \\n \\n [5] The Extradition Act (1988) of the Commonwealth provides two routes by which the question of whether surrender will occur may proceed. By s 18, a person who has been remanded, may consent to their surrender. The matter is then laid before the Commonwealth Attorney-General for determination as to whether surrender will, in fact, occur. Or, pursuant to s 19, there may be a contested hearing in relation to whether there is eligibility to surrender.\\n [6] The common factual ground here is that Mr Karsten indicated his consent to being extradited and, as I understand it, there is no dispute that the learned Magistrate went through the necessary steps under s 18(2) which requires a magistrate, unless they have reason to believe the consent was not voluntary, to advise the person of the effect and consequences of their determination to surrender. There is no specific provision in the Act relating to a variation of that determination. \\n\\nHis Honour's reasons for decision record the submission made through the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions that the Supreme Court had:\\n \\n [7] ... no general jurisdiction ... to entertain firstly an appeal from a s 18 decision, and specifically no jurisdiction to permit a variation in the form of consent that was on the papers at least given at that hearing. \\n\\nThe question before Connolly J was formulated by his Honour as being \\\" whether or not this Court has the jurisdiction to entertain an application to allow Mr Karsten to withdraw his consent to an extradition \\\": [2007] ACTSC 20 at [1] . That question was answered in the negative. His Honour did, however, go on to further observe: \\n \\n [18] There is a general discretion in the Attorney in relation to the extradition process, and it seems to me that the question of the voluntariness of consent would be a question that the Attorney would need to satisfy himself of. Clearly, if a situation was one where a person had no English skills at all, or had been tricked in some way into agreeing to consent, that would be a matter that would necessarily attract attention and the Attorney and [sic] would need to make a determination to that effect. \\n\\nBefore the Supreme Court Mr Karsten was legally represented. A more general submission advanced on the hearing of the present Motion before this Court that Mr Karsten was thereafter represented by counsel, it is considered, should not be accepted. What advice was given to Mr Karsten by his then legal representative when appearing in the Supreme Court remains, not surprisingly, unknown.\\n\\n47 Relevantly, however, by the time the s 22 determination was made, the only judicial challenge to the s 18 decision had been heard and resolved against Mr Karsten. In such circumstances it is considered that the requirements of s 22 had been met, namely that there was a lawful \\\" order of a magistrate made under section 18 \\\", and that any condition precedent to the exercise of the power conferred by s 22 had been satisfied.\\n\\n48 Even if the construction of s 22 which has been given to that section be incorrect, it is considered that it would be an abuse of process to now permit the Applicant to advance such a contention. It would be an abuse of the process of the Court for a person the subject of extradition proceedings to seek to challenge an order made pursuant to s 18; to be informed that the means of challenge then being invoked were not available to him; to thereafter await a determination made under s 22; and, when that determination is adverse, to be permitted to then revert to his earlier position by asserting that there was no power to make the s 22 determination.\",\"11\":\"2 The Further Amended Application seeks to challenge a notice issued under s 16 of the Extradition Act 1988 (Cth) on 24 October 2006 and a determination that the Applicant be surrendered pursuant to s 22 of that Act. The Applicant contends that for the purposes of the Act that: \\n \\n(i) he is not an \\\" extraditable person \\\" within ss 6 and 16 ; \\n \\n(ii) the offence in respect of which extradition is sought is not an \\\" extradition offence \\\" within ss 5 and 16 ; and \\n \\n(iii) he is not an \\\" eligible person \\\" within s 22. \\n \\nThese contentions, if made out, are said to constitute jurisdictional error on the part of the Respondent Minister.\\n\\n3 On 19 February 2008 a Further Amended Notice of Motion was filed on behalf of the Respondent Minister seeking the dismissal of the Further Amended Application . It is that Motion which is presently before the Court.\\n\\n4 It is considered that each of the Applicant's contentions should be rejected and that the orders as sought in the Respondent Minister's Motion should be made.\\n\\n8 A warrant under s 18(2) was thereafter issued on 20 December 2006 by Magistrate Madden, a magistrate of the Australian Capital Territory. On the same day a letter was forwarded by the Magistrate to the then Attorney-General (the Honourable Phillip Ruddock) identifying the Applicant and stating:\\n \\nAs required by s 18(2)(b)(ii) of the Extradition Act 1988 I advise that on 20 December 2006 the abovenamed consented to being surrendered to the Federal Republic of Germany in relation to the following offence:\\n \\n1. attempted incitement to commit murder contrary to sections 211 and 30 of the German Criminal Code (1 count).\\n \\nI enclose a copy of the warrant under subsection 18(2)(b)(i) that I signed today.\\n\\n9 On 5 July 2007 the Applicant was advised that the Minister had determined under s 22 that the Applicant was to be surrendered to Germany and that a warrant had been issued for his surrender.\\n\\n49 Repetitious challenges to decisions made under the Extradition Act 1988 (Cth), or a failure to raise for resolution issues relevant to a decision the subject of review may constitute an abuse of process: Rivera v Minister Administering the Extradition Act 1988 (Cth) [2007] FCAFC 191 at [13] [15] per Rares J, [2007] FCAFC 191 ; 99 ALD 235. See also Brock v Minister for Justice & Customs [2007] FCA 2091. In the present proceedings, it is considered an abuse of process for the Applicant to now again seek to agitate the validity of the order made under s 18 and to thereby attempt to vitiate the subsequent s 22 determination.\",\"12\":\"19 The approach urged upon the Court by Mr Karsten, namely an invitation to go behind the face of both the request and (more importantly) the warrant itself is an invitation which should be rejected. Section 16(2) , framed as it is in terms of an \\\" opinion \\\", should not be construed as requiring the Attorney-General or the Minister to become an expert in foreign law and construed in a manner which has the potential to frustrate the discharge by Australia of its obligations under extradition treaties: Tervonen v Minister for Justice & Customs (No 2) [2007] FCA 1684 , 98 ALD 589. Rares J there observed:\\n \\n [38] In Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v Kainhofer [1995] HCA 35 ; (1995) 185 CLR 528 at 540 Brennan CJ, Dawson and McHugh JJ left open the meaning to be attributed to the word 'accused' in s 6(a)(i) of the Act, noting:\\n It is sufficient to say that, in considering whether a person is an extraditable person under s 6(a)(i) of the Act, it is necessary to bear in mind the statutory object of enabling Australia to carry out its obligations under extradition treaties with countries that adopt a variety of criminal procedures different from our own.\\n [39] The Attorney-General cannot be expected to be an expert in foreign law: Williams v Minister for Justice and Customs [2007] FCAFC 33 ; 157 FCR 286 at 298 [49] . Minds may differ as to the proper construction of s 6(a)(i) and whether a particular warrant relied on by an extradition country falls within it (as the decision of the Full Court, which the High Court reversed in Kainhofer [1995] HCA 35 ; (1995) 185 CLR 528 , illustrates). For this reason s 16(2)(a)(i) is framed so that the Attorney-General must form the opinion that the person is an extraditable person. \\n\\n His Honour continued:\\n \\n [40] Having regard to the terms of the warrants and other material before him, I am of opinion that it was open to Senator Ellison to form the opinion that they met the criterion in s 6(a)(i). Each warrant asserted that there was probable cause for suspecting that Mr Tervonen had committed an offence and that the Court which issued the warrant considered he ought be arrested.\\n ...\\n [42] Each warrant, on its face, was termed a 'warrant'. It was issued by a Finnish court for the arrest of Mr Tervonen who was stated to have been suspected on probable cause of having committed an offence. The Minister could reasonably form the opinion that each document was a warrant, issued by a Finnish Court, in force, for the arrest of Mr Tervonen in relation to an offence against the law of Finland that he was accused of having committed within the meaning of s 6(a)(i). While other persons may not have formed the same view, having regard to the significant differences between the laws of other countries and Australia, to which Mason CJ, Dawson and McHugh JJ referred to in Kainhofer [1995] HCA 35 ; (1995) 185 CLR 528 at 540, I am of opinion that it was open to Senator Ellison to form the view that each of the warrants was one which met the description in s 6(a)(i). \\n\\nAn appeal from this decision has been allowed in part, although it was not necessary for the Full Court to make any comment in relation to the above observations of the learned trial judge: Minister for Home Affairs v Tervonen [2008] FCAFC 24. See also Cabal v United Mexican States (No 3) [2000] FCA 1204 at [149] and [153], [2000] FCA 1204 ; 186 ALR 188 per French J.\",\"13\":\"42 Whether or not either of these two fields of inquiry can be properly characterised as \\\" jurisdictional facts \\\" thus need not be resolved. The resolution of whether a fact is jurisdictional or not remains a matter of statutory construction: Timbarra Protection Coalition Inc v Ross Mining NL [1999] NSWCA 8 at [39] , 46 NSWLR 55 at 64 per Spigelman CJ (Mason P and Meagher JA agreeing). Less difficulty may be experienced in characterising as a \\\" jurisdictional fact \\\" a question as to whether a person has informed a magistrate of his consent; greater difficulty, however, may be experienced in characterising as \\\" jurisdictional \\\" whether a magistrate had \\\" reason to believe that the consent was not given voluntarily\\\" . The potential inconvenience consequent upon construing s 18 in such a manner may be a telling reason to conclude that such matters are not \\\" jurisdictional \\\": cf Brock v United States of America [2007] FCAFC 3 at [30] per Black CJ, [2007] FCAFC 3 ; 157 FCR 121.\",\"14\":\"10 The Extradition Act 1988 (Cth) sets forth a four stage process for the extradition of a person from Australia. These four stages have been summarised as follows by the Full Court in Harris v Attorney-General (Cth) (1994) 52 FCR 386 at 389:\\n \\n The Act contemplates four stages in extradition proceedings as follows: (1) Commencement; (2) Remand; (3) Determination by a magistrate of eligibility for surrender; (4) Executive determination that the person is to be surrendered. In summary form, the scheme is as follows: The commencement of proceedings is by the issue of a provisional warrant under s 12(1) or by the giving of a notice under s 16(1). Once arrested, the person is required by s 15 to be taken before a magistrate and remanded in custody or on bail for such period as may be necessary for eligibility proceedings to be taken under s 19. Where a person is on remand under s 15 and the Attorney-General has given a notice under s 16(1), provision is made under s 19 for a magistrate to conduct proceedings to determine whether the person is eligible for surrender. If eligibility is so determined by the magistrate, provision is made by s 22 for the Attorney-General to decide whether the person is to be surrendered. \\n\\nThis approach has subsequently been endorsed by Gleeson CJ in Vasiljkovic v Commonwealth [2006] HCA 40 at [29] , [2006] HCA 40 ; 227 CLR 614 and by Gummow J in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v Kainhofer [1995] HCA 35 , 185 CLR 528 at 547. It has most recently been endorsed by a Full Court of this Court in Minister for Home Affairs v Tervonen [2008] FCAFC 24 at [9] per Jacobson, Bennett and Buchanan JJ.\"}}"
