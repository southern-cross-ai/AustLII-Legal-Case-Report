It put forward three reasons for this. First, it was said to be inconsistent with reg 30(2C), which explicitly imposes conditions on the holder of a certificate of approval in relation to the persons employed by it; secondly, it was said that the regulation did not set forth any criteria by which the acceptability might be measured; thirdly , it was said that the Tribunal had, in truth, remitted its function to the Authority, a course which was said to be forbidden by this Court's decision in Civil Aviation Safety Authority v Allan [2001] FCA 1064 ; (2001) 114 FCR 14.\\n\\nI do not think these submissions have substance. Reg 30(2C) provides: \\n (2C) A certificate of approval is subject to: \\n\\n(a) a condition that each activity the certificate covers must only be carried out at a place where the facilities and equipment necessary for the proper carrying out of the activity are available to the holder of the certificate;\\n \\n(b) a condition that the activities the certificate covers must be carried out in accordance with a system of quality control that satisfies the requirements of subregulation (2D); and\\n \\n(c) if the certificate covers some or all of the following activities:\\n \\n(i) the design of aircraft;\\n \\n(ii) the design of aircraft components;\\n \\n(iii) the design of aircraft materials;\\n \\n(vii) the maintenance of aircraft;\\n \\n(viii) the maintenance of aircraft components;\\n \\n(ix) the maintenance of aircraft materials;\\n \\n(x) the training of candidates for the examinations referred to in paragraph 31 (4) (e);\\n \\n(xi) the conducting of the examinations referred to in paragraph 31 (4) (e);\\n \\na condition that each of those activities that is covered by the certificate must be carried out under the control of a person appointed by the applicant to control the activities; and\\n \\n(d) a condition that the holder of the certificate of approval must ensure that each person employed by, or working under an arrangement with, the holder receives adequate training in:\\n \\n(i) the work performed by the person for the purposes of the activities covered by the certificate; and\\n \\n(ii) the use of any equipment used in connection with that work.\\n\\nAs I apprehend it, the argument is that because of the specific provisions of reg 30(2C) it should be concluded that there is excluded from the power in reg 269(1) any power to impose conditions regulating the qualities of persons employed by a certificate holder. To accept such an argument it would be necessary to identify some negative implication from reg 30(2C) to the effect that no other power might be used to achieve a similar result. I can discern in it no basis for such an implication.\",\"4\":\"The issues which arise from s 43(2) are more subtle. There is no doubt it requires the Tribunal to provide reasons which are adequate. There is also little question but that the question of adequacy, in the present circumstances, directs attention at least to the efficacy of the appeal process contemplated by s 44. The reasons must be at least sufficient in quality to permit that appeal process to be efficacious. However, the appeal process under s 44 is subject to the constraint that there be present a \\\"question of law\\\". Debate exists as to whether a failure to provide reasons is an error of law. There is an obiter dictum of Brennan J in Repatriation Commission v O'Brien [1985] HCA 10 ; (1985) 155 CLR 422 at 445-446 which suggests that a failure by the Tribunal to provide adequate reasons does not result in the invalidity of its decision and that the proper remedy is a mandatory order that reasons be provided. That view has not prevailed in this Court where it has instead been held that a failure to provide adequate reasons is an error of law: Dornan v Riordan (1990) 24 FCR 564 at 573 per Sweeney, Davies and Burchett JJ. The contrary view is set forth in Comcare v Lees (1997) 151 ALR 647 at 658-659 by Finkelstein J. The existence of the debate about the correctness of Dornan has been noted on a number of occasions by Full Courts of this Court, but none have thought it necessary to resolve it.\\n\\nTo the extent that Lees assumes that there is no question of law where there is no error of law I respectfully differ. Every error of law corresponds with a question of law but the converse is not true. Questions of law concerning the processes of the Tribunal rather than its actual decision are likely to give rise to questions of law which do not correspond with any error of law in the decision of the Tribunal. The provision of inadequate reasons is one illustration; a departure from a statutorily mandated procedure during the course of a hearing may be another.\\n\\nThere is a textual argument available against this view. Section 44 uses the expression \\\"question of law\\\" when conferring jurisdiction on this Court to hear an appeal. The same expression is used in s 45 which permits, in certain circumscribed circumstances, the referral by the Tribunal to this Court of a \\\"question of law\\\". It may be that the expressions should bear the same meaning; if so, there may be difficulties in contemplating the Tribunal referring the adequacy of its own reasons to the Court. However, the answer to that is either that \\\"question of law\\\" in s 45 does not so extend or, alternatively, that it does and that the Tribunal could refer the adequacy of its own reasons to this Court.\",\"5\":\"The second matter to which I should refer is the Tribunal's reference at [127] to having \\\"had regard to the authorities relied on by both parties, including Re Snook and Civil Aviation Safety Authority [2003] AATA 285 , Re Brazier and Civil Aviation Safety Authority [2004] AATA 31 and Re Richards Aviation Services v Civil Aviation Safety Authority (AAT, 26 November 1996).\\\" It has been held, in the context of the adequacy of judicial reasons, that setting out two sets of competing submissions and indicating a preference for one over the other is not a sufficient discharge of the judicial obligation to give reasons: Commissioner for Railways for the State of Queensland v Peters (1991) 24 NSWLR 407 at 415-417 per Kirby P; Fyntray Constructions Pty Ltd v Macind Drainage & Hydraulic Services Pty Ltd [2002] NSWCA 238 at [66] per Heydon JA, [68] per Hodgson JA, [78] per Ipp AJA.\",\"6\":\"Of course, if Dornan is correct then, additionally, the Tribunal made an error of law. However, the significance of that for present purposes hinges upon whether that conclusion would lead to a different result. Clearly, such an approach would require the Tribunal to produce its reasons again. The difference would be that, if the error of law were jurisdictional the orders of the Tribunal might be set aside, it might have to re-exercise its powers afresh and it might have to do more than just produce reasons. I think it is unlikely that the error of law constituted by inadequate reasons could be jurisdictional. It is true, no doubt, that generally, an error of law will, in the hands of a non-judicial tribunal, be jurisdictional: Craig v South Australia [1995] HCA 58 ; (1995) 184 CLR 163 at 179 per Brennan, Deane, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ. However, it is to be noted that the errors of law there identified as having that effect were said to be those causing an inferior tribunal to identify the wrong issue. It may be doubted whether an error of law constituted by inadequate reasons could ever have that effect for reasons explained in Yusuf .\",\"7\":\"The issues which arise from s 43(2) are more subtle.

The existence of the debate about the correctness of Dornan has been noted on a number of occasions by Full Courts of this Court, but none have thought it necessary to resolve it.\\n\\nHowever, as I have said, the question of whether the Tribunal's reasons are adequate is a \\\"question of law\\\". More formally, the question is whether the Tribunal has complied with its statutory duty under s 43(2) of the AAT Act. That is, without any doubt, a question of law even if a failure to provide adequate reasons might not involve an error of law in the decision of the Tribunal. Thus the question of the correctness of Dornan does not arise for consideration in the context of an appeal under s 44 where what is required is not the identification of an error of law by the Tribunal but rather the existence of a question of law for the consideration of the Court. Of course, any appeal on such a question of law is necessarily delimited by the requirement that there exist a matter in respect of which this Court might exercise its jurisdiction.\\n\\nFor those reasons, I would prefer to regard the adequacy of reasons as reviewable under s 44 of the Act not because Dornan binds me to such a conclusion but rather because the adequacy of reasons is a question of law within the meaning of s 44.\\n\\nThe Authority's challenge to the adequacy of the reasons provided by the Tribunal turns upon the content of paragraph 127 of the Tribunal's reasons which is set out at [19] above. In essence the complaint is that there is no explanation by the Tribunal of how it decided that Mr Fawcett and Central were fit and proper persons the paragraph merely states a conclusion. This syllogistic infelicity was supported, so the Authority argued, by noting the gulf between the Tribunal's factual findings unremittingly negative at least where competence was concerned and its conclusions on whether Central and Mr Fawcett were fit and proper persons within the meaning of reg 269(d).\\n\\nThus, on the one hand, the Tribunal had concluded that Mr Fawcett had, in his approach to the installation of the engine of the Cirrus plane exhibited \\\"a fundamental failure to understand his role\\\" (at [109]) and that his explanation proffered for that failure did not \\\"excuse what I consider to be a fundamental failure as a LAME\\\" (at [110]) and that he \\\"seemed to have little understanding of the concept of quality control which is central to holding a Certificate of Approval under CAR 30\\\" (at [123]). The Tribunal described this last matter as being \\\"of concern\\\" (at [123]). On the other hand, it found that Mr Fawcett and Central were fit and proper \\\"to have the responsibilities and exercise and perform the functions and duties of a holder of a licence and a certificate of approval respectively\\\" (at [127]).\\n\\nOf course, if Dornan is correct then, additionally, the Tribunal made an error of law. However, the significance of that for present purposes hinges upon whether that conclusion would lead to a different result. Clearly, such an approach would require the Tribunal to produce its reasons again. The difference would be that, if the error of law were jurisdictional the orders of the Tribunal might be set aside, it might have to re-exercise its powers afresh and it might have to do more than just produce reasons. I think it is unlikely that the error of law constituted by inadequate reasons could be jurisdictional.

However, it is to be noted that the errors of law there identified as having that effect were said to be those causing an inferior tribunal to identify the wrong issue. It may be doubted whether an error of law constituted by inadequate reasons could ever have that effect for reasons explained in Yusuf .\\n\\nHowever, even if Dornan required the conclusion that the decision of the Tribunal were afflicted by jurisdictional error, in the exercise of my discretion I would not set aside the Tribuna's decision. The existence of that discretion is confirmed by s 44(4) which provides that this Court \\\"may\\\" make such order as it thinks appropriate. In the context of a jurisdictional error, it is appropriate that that discretion be exercised in a way which is analogous to the refusal of prerogative relief on discretionary grounds. In that regard, the existence of an adequate alternative remedy is a proper basis for refusing relief: R v Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration; ex parte Ozone Theatres (Aust) Ltd [1949] HCA 33 ; (1949) 78 CLR 389 at 400 per Latham CJ, Rich, Dixon, McTiernan and Webb JJ. Here adequate alternative relief is available if the decision is left in place because s 43AA(3)(b) allows the Tribunal to correct its decision to ensure consistency with its reasons. That, of course, will still require an order that the Tribunal produce reasons which are adequate. It is not entirely clear to me how Dornan can explain that necessity but it is not necessary to determine that issue any other result would be surreal.\",\"8\":\"A number of decisions of this Court have established the ambit and purpose of the expression \\\"question of law\\\".

It does not require the Tribunal to make the findings which it ought to have made: Appellant V324 of 2004 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 259 at [8] per Hill and Allsop JJ; see also Repatriation Commission v Cotton (2006) 93 ALD 118 at 128 [42] per Rares J; Gilkinson v Repatriation Commission (2008) 104 ALD 406 at 410 [14] per Rares J. That conclusion is inevitable in light of the High Court's decision in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 at 331-332 [10] per Gleeson CJ, 349 [77] per McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ where it was held that s 430 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) which is not materially different to s 43(2B) operated in that manner.\",\"11\":\"The first is the Tribunal's conclusion that Mr Fawcett was an honest man who would suffer financial hardship if Central's certificate of approval were cancelled. One cannot tell from the Tribunal's reasons where, or even if, these findings were taken into account. It is difficult to see that they had anything to do with the Tribunal's conclusions that Mr Fawcett and Central had failed, within the meaning of reg 269(1)(c), in the duty imposed on them with respect to a matter affecting the safe operation of the Cirrus aircraft. Whatever else might be said about the failure by Mr Fawcett to notice that the steel cap was missing from the engine port, it is difficult to incorporate notions of honesty or financial hardship into that particular field of discourse. On the other hand, it is difficult to see how financial hardship to Mr Fawcett had any relevance to the issue of whether he, or Central, were fit and proper persons: cf. Hughes and Vale Proprietary Limited v State of New South Wales (No 2) [1955] HCA 28 ; (1955) 93 CLR 127 at 156-157 per Dixon CJ, McTiernan and Webb JJ. It is possible that his honesty could be seen as going to fitness and propriety but it is difficult to understand, without more, how honesty might be an answer to a lack of fitness said to be constituted by incompetence.\\n\\nOf course, it may be that those factors were taken into account in deciding how to exercise the discretionary power to vary, suspend or cancel which arose consequent upon the Tribunal's conclusions about reg 269(1)(c). There is nothing to indicate, however, that this is what occurred. Indeed, there is no explanation of how the Tribunal came to the conclusion that it was appropriate to vary the conditions other than that those variations were \\\"appropriate to satisfy the paramount consideration of aviation safety\\\" (at [128]).\",\"12\":\"Strictly speaking, a statement by a decision-maker as to its reasons for decision would ordinarily be hearsay and inadmissible. However, it is generally accepted that so long as the reasons are reasonably contemporaneous with an administrative decision they are admissible as part of the res gestae: Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Taveli [1990] FCA 169 ; (1990) 23 FCR 162 at 168 per Davies J, 187 per Hill J.

The last two mentioned decisions use the language of the res gestae rule, however, it may be that they should be understood as being illustrations of s 72 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) which appears to be its statutory embodiment.\",\"13\":\"There were two other matters raised by the Tribunal which potentially bear upon this issue. I mention these matters because it is necessary to discern, if it is possible, how the Tribunal connected its findings about Mr Fawcett's failings to its conclusions about fitness and propriety. This is particularly so where the High Court has emphasised the need to avoid over-zealous parsing of the reasons of administrative decision-makers: Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 272 per Brennan CJ, Toohey, McHugh and Gummow JJ.\",\"14\":\"The Authority's arguments as to the inadequacy of the Tribunal's reasons were based on these provisions.

In that circumstance, I propose to treat the ground as relating to the duty imposed by s 43(2B). The allegation that s 43(2B) requires the Tribunal to make such findings is, I think, untenable. As I have already noted, that view of s 43(2B) is at odds with the approach held to be required by the High Court to s 430 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) in Yusuf .\\n\\nThe three questions of law relating to this issue posed by the applicant were as follows: \\n (a) whether the Tribunal made all necessary findings of fact to support its conclusion that the grounds for cancellation of the respondent's CoA relied upon by the applicant for the purposes of CAR 269(1)(d) had not been made out;\\n (f) whether the Tribunal failed to give reasons (or sufficient and adequate reasons) for its decision in breach of s.43 (2) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (\\\"the AAT Act\\\"); and\\n (g) further or alternatively, whether the Tribunal failed to include in its reasons findings (or sufficient and adequate findings) on material questions of fact or otherwise failed to refer to the evidence or other material on which such findings were based in breach of s.43 (2B) of the AAT Act.\\n\\nIn light of my conclusions, questions (a) and (g) should be answered: \\\"The Tribunal complied with its obligations under s 43(2B).\\\" Question (f) should be answered: \\\"No. The reasons of the Tribunal were not adequate.\\\" Second issue: irrelevant considerations\\n\\nOf course, if Dornan is correct then, additionally, the Tribunal made an error of law.

Tuncok v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 1069 at [62] - [63] per Hely J; Nezovic v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 1263 ; (2003) 133 FCR 190 at 205-206 [50] - [52] per French J. The last two mentioned decisions use the language of the res gestae rule, however, it may be that they should be understood as being illustrations of s 72 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) which appears to be its statutory embodiment.\",\"16\":\"However, even if Dornan required the conclusion that the decision of the Tribunal were afflicted by jurisdictional error, in the exercise of my discretion I would not set aside the Tribuna's decision. The existence of that discretion is confirmed by s 44(4) which provides that this Court \\\"may\\\" make such order as it thinks appropriate. In the context of a jurisdictional error, it is appropriate that that discretion be exercised in a way which is analogous to the refusal of prerogative relief on discretionary grounds. In that regard, the existence of an adequate alternative remedy is a proper basis for refusing relief: R v Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration; ex parte Ozone Theatres (Aust) Ltd [1949] HCA 33 ; (1949) 78 CLR 389 at 400 per Latham CJ, Rich, Dixon, McTiernan and Webb JJ. Here adequate alternative relief is available if the decision is left in place because s 43AA(3)(b) allows the Tribunal to correct its decision to ensure consistency with its reasons. That, of course, will still require an order that the Tribunal produce reasons which are adequate. It is not entirely clear to me how Dornan can explain that necessity but it is not necessary to determine that issue any other result would be surreal.\",\"17\":\"The Authority's arguments as to the inadequacy of the Tribunal's reasons were based on these provisions. So far as the argument was based on s 43(2B) it must be rejected. The Full Court of this Court has held that that provision requires the Tribunal to do no more that to state the findings which it has actually made. It does not require the Tribunal to make the findings which it ought to have made: Appellant V324 of 2004 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 259 at [8] per Hill and Allsop JJ; see also Repatriation Commission v Cotton (2006) 93 ALD 118 at 128 [42] per Rares J; Gilkinson v Repatriation Commission (2008) 104 ALD 406 at 410 [14] per Rares J. That conclusion is inevitable in light of the High Court's decision in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 at 331-332 [10] per Gleeson CJ, 349 [77] per McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ where it was held that s 430 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) which is not materially different to s 43(2B) operated in that manner.\",\"18\":\"The issues which arise from s 43(2) are more subtle. There is no doubt it requires the Tribunal to provide reasons which are adequate. There is also little question but that the question of adequacy, in the present circumstances, directs attention at least to the efficacy of the appeal process contemplated by s 44. The reasons must be at least sufficient in quality to permit that appeal process to be efficacious. However, the appeal process under s 44 is subject to the constraint that there be present a \\\"question of law\\\". Debate exists as to whether a failure to provide reasons is an error of law. There is an obiter dictum of Brennan J in Repatriation Commission v O'Brien [1985] HCA 10 ; (1985) 155 CLR 422 at 445-446 which suggests that a failure by the Tribunal to provide adequate reasons does not result in the invalidity of its decision and that the proper remedy is a mandatory order that reasons be provided. That view has not prevailed in this Court where it has instead been held that a failure to provide adequate reasons is an error of law: Dornan v Riordan (1990) 24 FCR 564 at 573 per Sweeney, Davies and Burchett JJ. The contrary view is set forth in Comcare v Lees (1997) 151 ALR 647 at 658-659 by Finkelstein J. The existence of the debate about the correctness of Dornan has been noted on a number of occasions by Full Courts of this Court, but none have thought it necessary to resolve it.\",\"19\":\"The Authority argued that it did not have an opportunity to dissuade the Tribunal from imposing a condition about the \\\"acceptability\\\" to it of the LAME and the person carrying out the auditing role. The Authority's submissions in this Court proceeded on the basis that it was denied the opportunity to put to the Tribunal \\\"the correct construction of [reg 30]\\\". This I take to be a denial of the opportunity to put the submission I have just rejected. Even if one assumes that the Authority was prevented from arguing against the word \\\"acceptable\\\" and that it was denied procedural fairness as a result, that denial was not material: cf Stead v State Government Insurance Commission [1986] HCA 54 ; (1996) 161 CLR 141 at 145 per Mason, Wilson, Brennan, Deane and Dawson JJ.\\n\\nQuestion (d) was as follows: \\n (d) whether the Tribunal provided the applicant with an opportunity (or adequate opportunity) to address the Tribunal on the conditions that it intended to impose on the respondent's CoA and whether those conditions would conform to the requirements of the CA Act and CAR 30;\\n\\nI would answer the question: \\\"No. The Tribunal did not afford the applicant an opportunity to submit that its proposed conditions did not comply with reg 30. However, this was not material.\\\" Disposition\",\"20\":\"Strictly speaking, a statement by a decision-maker as to its reasons for decision would ordinarily be hearsay and inadmissible.
