I doubt very much whether an application under the ADJR Act can be used to seek the cancellation of a trade mark when there is a direct avenue for that remedy under s 88 of the Trade Marks Act : see Mark Foys Pty Ltd v TVSN (Pacific) Ltd [2000] FCA 1626 ; (2000) 104 FCR 61 at 78-79 [63] - [66] .\\n\\nThere are other reasons for thinking that the ADJR Act application is untenable in its present state. The pleading is irregular as to form and the statutory basis for the allegation of error of law is not made clear. There are substantial discretionary obstacles to the grant of relief under the ADJR Act, aside from the availability of more direct remedies under the Trade Marks Act : the trade marks were registered in 2001; the proceeding was issued in 2004; the application for leave to file and serve the proposed cross-claim was mounted in July 2006; and, following orders for further directions, it is being heard only now in September 2006.\\n\\nI do not propose to express any final view about the question whether an ADJR Act application could conceivably be filed, if properly framed. The form of the proposed cross-claim is not one I am prepared to allow to proceed.\",\"1\":\"The other argument, which I find less persuasive, is that the amendment that described the three dimensional shape of the barrel of a lighter as being a 'right cylinder of elliptical cross section' fell foul of s 65 because there could be any number of right cylinders of elliptical cross section. The difficulty with this argument is that it seeks to read the endorsement without regard to the pictorial depiction of the elliptical shape in the representation of the mark. The two must be read together: see Woolworths Limited v BP plc [2006] FCAFC 132 at [31] - [47] .\\n\\nIn my view, there is the possibility of such arguments being raised under s 65 to found an opposition to registration under s 68, having regard to the provisions of s 62(a).\\n\\nThe second substantive grievance raised concerned the Registrar's decision to accept registration of the mark under the provisions of s 41(6).\"}}"
