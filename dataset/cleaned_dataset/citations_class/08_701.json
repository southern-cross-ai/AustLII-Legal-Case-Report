But, in my opinion, it does not follow that the decision to issue and serve the Notice was for an improper purpose. There are two reasons for this.\\n\\n102 Fourth, in Rural Press at [37], Mansfield J agreed with the view expressed by Lockhart J in Kotan . Mansfield J went on at [38] to say that the question of whether the power has been exercised for an improper purpose is a matter to be decided in all the circumstances. I respectfully agree with this observation.\\n\\n119 The short answer to KAL's submission is that the evidence before me demonstrates that the purpose of the ACCC in deciding to issue the Notice was to obtain evidence of the extent of any contraventions by KAL and evidence going to the quantum of any penalty. All of this might ultimately be used in the event that the ACCC decides to commence proceedings. This purpose falls \\\"squarely within the Act\\\": Rural Press at [40].\\n\\n120 Reference was made in cross-examination of Mr Pearson to the ACCC's knowledge of difficulties encountered in obtaining an order for discovery and interrogatories in existing proceedings. It has not been demonstrated that this was an actuating purpose in the decision to serve the Notice.\\n\\n121 The application will be dismissed. I will hear the parties briefly on the question of costs.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n I certify that the preceding one hundred and twenty-one (121) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Jacobson. \\n\\nAssociate:\\n\\nDate: 15 May 2008\\n\\n Counsel for the Applicant: S Gageler SC with M Darke \\n \\n Solicitor for the Applicant: Clayton Utz \\n \\n Counsel for the Respondent: A Robertson SC, T Howe QC and R A Dick \\n \\n Solicitor for the Respondent: Australian Government Solicitor \\n \\n Date of hearing: 7 April 2008 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 15 May 2008 \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2008\\/701.html\",\"1\":\"78 In Brown v Commissioner of Taxation at [184] [185], Emmett J considered that s 131(2)(g) will apply where the Court would be likely to be misled as to the existence or contents of an excluded communication where those matters are in issue in the proceedings: see also Bloss Holdings Pty Ltd v Brackley Industries Pty Ltd [2005] NSWSC 756 at [7] .\",\"2\":\"103 Nor, in my view, does the statement of Franki J in Brambles Holdings Ltd v Trade Practices Commission (No 2) (1980) 44 FLR 182 at 189 support the view that the power automatically ceases when the proceedings have been commenced.\\n\\n104 It seems to me that the effect of what Franki J said was captured in the words of Gibbs CJ in Pioneer Concrete at 467-468. Thus, if the power were used to assist a party in proceedings already pending, in a way that would confer an advantage which the procedures of the Court would otherwise deny, there would be a contempt; however, not every investigation into facts the subject of an existing proceeding constitutes a contempt.\\n\\n105 In any event, whether or not the question of law is decided favourably to KAL, the contention fails at the factual level because I am not satisfied that the ACCC had decided to commence proceedings.\\n\\n106 Ultimately, Mr Gageler conceded that there was no decision by the ACCC to commence proceedings and he accepted that there was no recommendation to the ACCC that proceedings be commenced. However, he adhered to the submission that, as at 31 October 2007, there had for some time been a very firm intention, contemplation or expectation that proceedings would be commenced subject only to the ACCC being satisfied of the sufficiency of evidence of a contravention of s 45.\",\"3\":\"69 It is implicit in the remarks of Emmett J in Brown v Commissioner of Taxation (2001) 187 ALR 714 at [172] [174] that the same position applies under s 131 of the Evidence Act .\\n\\n78 In Brown v Commissioner of Taxation at [184] [185], Emmett J considered that s 131(2)(g) will apply where the Court would be likely to be misled as to the existence or contents of an excluded communication where those matters are in issue in the proceedings: see also Bloss Holdings Pty Ltd v Brackley Industries Pty Ltd [2005] NSWSC 756 at [7] .\",\"4\":\"113 In any event, officers of the ACCC do not have power to institute proceedings: Kotan at 516, 522. This is not a case in which it has been demonstrated that the principle stated in Carltona Ltd v Commissioner of Works [1943] 2 All ER 560 has any application: see also O'Reilly v Commissioners of the State Bank of Victoria [1983] HCA 47 ; (1983) 153 CLR 1 at 11.\",\"5\":\"88 The decision of the Full Court in Pioneer Concrete was upheld on appeal to the High Court: Pioneer Concrete (Vic) Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1982] HCA 65 ; (1982) 152 CLR 460.

First, other evidence must have already been adduced which would be likely to mislead the court unless evidence of the without prejudice communication is adduced.\",\"10\":\"68 The position at common law was that the privilege operated even where litigation had not yet commenced and extended to a dispute which would become the subject of litigation if it were not resolved: Rodgers v Rodgers [1964] HCA 25 ; (1964) 114 CLR 608 at 614; Harrington v Lowe (1996) 190 CLR 311 at 323; Glengallen at [28] [29].\",\"11\":\"116 Nor do I consider that the principle in Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298 is enlivened by the failure of the ACCC to call Mr Samuel or the members of staff who prepared the Reason to Believe paper. There are limits on the use which can be made of Jones v Dunkel in administrative law proceedings. This is not a case in which the inferences sought to be drawn by KAL would be hard to resist in the absence of evidence from the author of the documents: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia [2001] HCA 17 ; (2001) 205 CLR 507 at [92] , [143], [316] [317] and Singh v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 389 ; (2001) 109 FCR 152 at [71] .\\n\\n117 KAL relied on a number of matters to support an inference that the purpose for which the Notice was issued was an improper one, namely that the ACCC believed it may not be able to obtain the information through the Court's processes once it had commenced proceedings.\",\"12\":\"89 Other decisions of the Full Court of the Federal Court are to the same effect as the statement of principle of Deane J in Pioneer Concrete: see Kotan Holdings Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission (1991) 30 FCR 511 at 514 per Davies and Foster JJ; Seven Network Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2004] FCAFC 267 ; (2004) 140 FCR 170 at [48] per Sackville and Emmett JJ.\\n\\n96 Second, as Lockhart J observed in Kotan at 522, the use of s 155 for the purpose of obtaining evidence to be tendered in penalty proceedings on the question of the quantum of any penalty is a legitimate use of the power. This view is consistent with the observation of Mason J in Pioneer Concrete at 472 that the discharge of the Commission's administrative functions under the Act:\\n \\n ... include the investigation of alleged breaches, the acquisition of information and the obtaining of evidence for submission to the Court in proceedings in respect of a contravention.\\n\\n97 KAL's contention that the power to issue the Notice had ceased, or was \\\"spent\\\", depends upon whether I am satisfied that the ACCC had decided, either formally or informally, to commence proceedings against KAL at the time when the decision was made to issue the Notice.\\n\\n98 An affirmative answer to that question would not necessarily lead to a finding that the power was spent. This is because a question of law would then arise as to whether a decision by the ACCC to institute proceedings against KAL bars it from thereafter exercising the power to issue a notice under s 155 of the Act.\\n\\n99 The question of law is a debateable one. It cannot rise above the statement of Davies and Foster JJ in Kotan at 516 that there may be an arguable case that the power to issue a s 155 notice ceases when the Commission has formally resolved that legal proceedings be commenced. But there are other indications that this proposition does not accurately state the law.\\n\\n100 First, Davies and Foster JJ thought the preferable view to be to the contrary. Second, Lockhart J was inclined to the view that the power to issue a notice under s 155 does not end and is not abused merely because the Commission has made a decision to institute proceedings against the addressee of a proposed notice. His Honour went on to say that whether the power to issue a notice is abused is a question of fact to be determined in all of the circumstances: Kotan at 521.\\n\\n101 Third, Lockhart J's view is supported by the observations of French J in Shannahan v Trade Practices Commission [1991] FCA 95 ; (1991) 28 FCR 239 at 244. (See also French J at first instance in Re Kotan Holdings Pty Ltd & Ors v Trade Practices Commission [1991] FCA 273 ; (1991) 13 ATPR 41-122 at [7] ). His Honour said that there is nothing in the terms, context or purpose of s 155 to indicate that the power is compromised by the Commission having decided to commence proceedings.\\n\\n102 Fourth, in Rural Press at [37], Mansfield J agreed with the view expressed by Lockhart J in Kotan . Mansfield J went on at [38] to say that the question of whether the power has been exercised for an improper purpose is a matter to be decided in all the circumstances. I respectfully agree with this observation.\\n\\n113 In any event, officers of the ACCC do not have power to institute proceedings: Kotan at 516, 522. This is not a case in which it has been demonstrated that the principle stated in Carltona Ltd v Commissioner of Works [1943] 2 All ER 560 has any application: see also O'Reilly v Commissioners of the State Bank of Victoria [1983] HCA 47 ; (1983) 153 CLR 1 at 11.\\n\\n115 In my opinion, this distinction supports the view expressed in Kotan because it reaffirms the principle that it is only the Commissioners who have the power to institute proceedings.\",\"13\":\"83 KAL submitted that the evidence of the conversation was admissible under s 131(2)(g) because, without it, I would have only part of the picture in respect of an important aspect of KAL's case: Moran v Moran (No 3) [2000] NSWSC 151 at [13] . However, in my view, that is not the whole of the test which is stated in s 131(2)(g) and, ultimately,\\n\\n84 The high watermark of KAL's attack on the validity of the Notice is to be found in the concessions which Mr Gageler obtained from Mr Pearson and to which I referred in the introduction. The essential point which arises is whether, in light of Mr Pearson's concession that the information sought in the Notice is not required to establish a contravention of s 45(2)(a) or (b), it can nevertheless be said that the power was exercised for the purpose for which it was conferred.\\n\\n85 The answer to this question turns upon a consideration of the authorities on the ambit of the power and upon Mr Pearson's other evidence.\",\"14\":\"113 In any event, officers of the ACCC do not have power to institute proceedings: Kotan at 516, 522.

See also Environmental Protection Authority v Caltex Refining Co Pty Ltd [1993] HCA 74 ; (1993) 178 CLR 477 at 516-517 (note 62) per Brennan J.\",\"16\":\"87 Earlier, in Riley McKay Pty Limited v Bannerman [1977] FCA 7 ; (1977) 15 ALR 561 at 566, Bowen CJ said that the power must be exercised for the purposes for which it is given and not otherwise; that is, to assist the Commission in the exercise of its functions. Bowen CJ reiterated that view in Pioneer Concrete at 84. Sheppard J agreed with both the Chief Justice and Deane J.\",\"17\":\"68 The position at common law was that the privilege operated even where litigation had not yet commenced and extended to a dispute which would become the subject of litigation if it were not resolved: Rodgers v Rodgers [1964] HCA 25 ; (1964) 114 CLR 608 at 614; Harrington v Lowe (1996) 190 CLR 311 at 323; Glengallen at [28] [29].\",\"18\":\"70 Here, it is sufficiently clear from the terms of the conversation between Mr Owbridge and Mr Lloyd and the background which I have recounted that there was a likelihood of litigation if the settlement proposal was not accepted. In my view, that was sufficient to constitute a \\\"dispute\\\" for the purposes of s 131(1)(a) and s 131(5)(a) of the Evidence Act : Trade Practices Commission v Arnotts Ltd (1989) 88 ALR 69 at 73-74.\\n\\n73 The effect of the authorities at common law is that the privilege applies to offers to negotiate and expressions of willingness to do so; it is not necessary that there be an offer capable of acceptance: Trade Practices Commission v Arnotts at 72-73.\",\"19\":\"10 KAL therefore submitted that the purpose for which the Notice was issued exceeded the limits of the power to issue a Notice under s 155. The clearest statement of the principle which underlies KAL's attack on the decision to issue the Notice is to be found in the words of Deane J in Trade Practices Commission v Pioneer Concrete (Vic) Pty Ltd (1982) 55 FLR 77 at 95.\\n\\n11 In the relevant passage from Deane J's judgment, his Honour said that the power conferred under s 155 is to be used only for the purpose:\\n \\n ...of the performance by the Commission of the administrative function of determining whether proceedings should be instituted by the Commission...\\n\\n12 KAL contends that this principle is infringed so as to enliven the grounds of review stated in ss 5(1)(d), 5(1)(e) and 5(2)(c) of the ADJR Act .\\n\\n13 However, this contention must of course be looked at in light of the evidence as a whole, including in particular other evidence given by Mr Pearson as to the circumstances which existed at the time when the decision to issue the Notice was made.\\n\\n86 A consideration of the authorities supports the view of Deane J in the Full Federal Court of the Federal Court in Pioneer Concrete that the power is to be used only for the performance of the administrative function of determining whether proceedings should be instituted.\",\"20\":\"89 Other decisions of the Full Court of the Federal Court are to the same effect as the statement of principle of Deane J in Pioneer Concrete: see Kotan Holdings Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission (1991) 30 FCR 511 at 514 per Davies and Foster JJ; Seven Network Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2004] FCAFC 267 ; (2004) 140 FCR 170 at [48] per Sackville and Emmett JJ.\",\"21\":\"114 I do not consider that the decision of a Full Court in Visy Industries Holdings Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (2007) 161 FCR 122 at [84] assists KAL.
