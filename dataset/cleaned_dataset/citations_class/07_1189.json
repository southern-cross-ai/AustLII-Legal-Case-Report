The reason for this is that the parties do not intend that their agreement should give rise to legal relations. This intention may be implied from the subject matter of the agreement, but it may also be expressed by the parties. In social and family relations such an intention is readily implied, while in business matters the opposite result would ordinarily follow. However, even in business matters, there can be no reason why the parties should not intend to simply rely on each other's good faith and honour. If they clearly express such an intention, there can be no reason in public policy why effect should not be given to it (per Scrutton LJ in Rose and Frank Company v J. R. Crompton and Brothers, Limited ('Rose and Frank') [1923] 2 KB 261 at 288).\\n\\n39 In Rose and Frank the English Court of Appeal was considering a signed memorandum purporting to set out the understanding between two English firms supplying carbon paper of various kinds and the American firm which was importing such carbon paper. The document included the following:\\n \\n 'This arrangement is not entered into, nor is this memorandum written, as a formal or legal agreement, and shall not be subject to legal jurisdiction in the Law Courts either of the United States or England, but it is only a definite expression and record of the purpose and intention of the three parties concerned to which they each honourably pledge themselves with the fullest confidence, based on past business with each other, that it will be carried through by each of the three parties with mutual loyalty and friendly co-operation.' \\n\\n\\n \\nThe American firm sued the English firms for breach of the contract said to have arisen from the relevant memorandum. It was held that the document did not constitute a binding agreement.\",\"1\":\"40 An executed document becomes an agreement when and in the manner the parties intend that it should do so (see per Lord Greene, MR in Eccles v Bryant (1947) 2 All ER 865 at 869.3).

(1989) VR 695 at 700-701 as follows:\\n \\n ' \\\"It is a first principle of the law of contracts that there can be no binding and enforceable obligation unless the terms of the bargain, or at least its essential or critical terms, have been agreed upon. So, there is no concluded contract where an essential or critical term is expressly left to be settled by future agreement of the parties\\\"; per Sugarman J. (sic) in the Full Court of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, quoted on appeal with approval by Menzies J. in Thorby v. Goldberg [1964] HCA 41 ; (1964) 112 C.L.R. 597, at p.607. See also May and Butcher Ltd v. R. (H.L.) [1934] 2 K.B. 17, at p.20, per Lord Buckmaster and, at p.22, per Lord Warrington. \\n \\n An agreement by a term of which a relevant or critical term will be the subject of future agreement between the parties is not enforceable. This general principle of the law of contract was stated by Viscount Dunedin in May and Butcher Ltd. v. R. , at p.21 in the following passage: \\\"To be a good contract there must be a concluded bargain, and a concluded contract is one which settles everything that is necessary to be settled and leaves nothing to be settled by agreement between the parties. Of course it may leave something which still has to be determined, but then that determination must be a determination which does not depend upon the agreement between the parties. In the system of law in which I was brought up, that was expressed by one of those brocards of which perhaps we have been too fond, but which often express very neatly what is wanted: 'Certum est quod certum reddi potest.' Therefore, you may very well agree that a certain part of the contract of sale, such as price, may be settled by someone else. As a matter of the general law of contract all the essentials have to be settled. What are the essentials may vary according to the particular contract under consideration. We are here dealing with sale, and undoubtedly price is one of the essentials of sale, and if it is left still to be agreed between the parties, then there is no contract.\\\" \\n \\n Referring to the same principle of law, Lord Wright in Scammell and Nephew Ltd. v. Ouston [1941] A.C. 251, at pp. 268-9 stated: \\\"There are many cases in the books of what are called illusory contracts, that is, where the parties may have thought they were making a contract but failed to arrive at a definite bargain. It is a necessary requirement that an agreement in order to be binding must be sufficiently definite to enable a court to give it a practical meaning. Its terms must be so definite, or capable of being made definite without further agreement of the parties, that the promises and performances to be rendered by each party are reasonably certain.\\\" \\n \\n No doubt the principle is founded on recognition that the parties might subsequently fail to agree upon the undecided term, and that in such event the agreement would fail for want of agreement concerning a relevant term. The situation is distinguished from a contract made by parties leaving an essential term to be agreed upon by them, and if they fail to agree the disputed term is to be determined by a third party or by arbitration. ...'\",\"4\":\"42 It is also useful to have regard to the statement of principle contained in the judgment of Bray CJ in Powell and Berry v Jones and Jones (1968) SASR 394 at 397 as follows:\\n \\n 'It seems to me that there are four relevant categories of case where what at first sight looks like an enforceable contract subsequently turns out not to be one. No doubt these categories may and frequently do overlap and many cases fall within more than one of them. \\n \\n 1. The parties may have only agreed to agree. They may have left terms to be fixed by subsequent negotiation between them, their intention being that the provisions already agreed and those yet to be agreed shall operate together as one contract. Thorby v. Goldberg . \\n \\n 2. The parties may have made their agreement subject not only to the preparation but also to the execution of a formal document. In such a case, then, even though everything has in fact been agreed, either party may withdraw before the execution of such a document; e.g. Coope v. Ridout . Their intention must be taken to be that until such execution each of them has a locus poenitentiae . Many cases falling under this head also fall under the first. \\n \\n 3. The agreement may have left to the option of one party not only the mode of performance but whether there shall be any performance at all; e.g. Taylor v. Brewer . \\n \\n 4. There remains a residual class of case outside the first three categories where the agreement reached is so vague and uncertain that the court cannot give it any definite meaning at all. Cf. per Lord Wright in Scammell (G.) & Nephew Ltd. v. Ouston (H. C. & J. G.). ' \\n \\n (footnotes omitted)\",\"5\":\"43 In Biotechnology Australia Pty Ltd v Pace (1988) 15 NSWLR 130 at 150-151, McHugh JA, as his Honour then was, said under the heading 'Was the consideration illusory?':\\n \\n 'A contract made for a consideration which is illusory is unenforceable: Placer Development Ltd v The Commonwealth [1969] HCA 29 ; (1969) 121 CLR 353 at 356, 360-361 and Meehan v Jones [1982] HCA 52 ; (1982) 149 CLR 571 at 581. A consideration is illusory if its payment or fulfilment depends upon an unfettered discretion vested in the promisor.' \\n \\n\\nTo like effect Mr Justice Hope said at 143:\\n \\n 'All these decisions show how far courts are prepared to go in order to find that there is an enforceable contractual promise where that is what the parties have intended. There are of course limitations. I have already referred to the case where the promisor has a discretion, not only as to what he shall do, but also as to whether he shall do anything. Such a promise is illusory. Furthermore it appears that the promise will not be enforceable if the manner of performance, including the amount of money to be paid or, if relevant, the number of shares to be offered, is a matter entirely in the discretion of the promisor and no criteria by which the performance required of the promisor can be measured, or the minimum of that performance can be measured, is expressed or can be found to be implied.'\",\"6\":\"44 The use of language which, as a matter of construction and not mere speculation, cannot be given any one meaning rather than another will defeat any intention of the parties to make a binding contract (per Menzies J in The Council of the Upper Hunter County District v Australian Chilling and Freezing Co. Limited [1968] HCA 8 ; (1968) 118 CLR 429 at 441).\\n\\n45 Cases may arise where a vague, uncertain, or meaningless clause in a contract can simply be ignored. Other like clauses may be waived by a party if inserted solely for the benefit of that party. However, a clause which is definitive of the ultimate rights which it is contemplated that a party will get under his contract is incapable of being so treated.\\n\\n46 However, not all ambiguous contracts are to be found void for uncertainty. In The Council of the Upper Hunter County District v Australian Chilling and Freezing Co. Limited , Barwick CJ said at 436-7:\\n \\n '... a contract of which there can be more than one possible meaning or which when construed can produce in its application more than one result is not therefore void for uncertainty. As long as it is capable of a meaning, it will ultimately bear that meaning which the courts, or in an appropriate case, an arbitrator, decides is its proper construction: and the court or arbitrator will decide its application. The question becomes one of construction, of ascertaining the intention of the parties, and of applying it. Lord Tomlin's words in this connexion in Hillas & Co. Ltd. v. Arcos Ltd. ought to be kept in mind. So long as the language employed by the parties, to use Lord Wright's words in Scammell (G.) & Nephew Ltd. v. Ouston is not \\\"so obscure and so incapable of any definite or precise meaning that the Court is unable to attribute to the parties any particular contractual intention\\\", the contract cannot be held to be void or uncertain or meaningless. In the search for that intention, no narrow or pedantic approach is warranted, particularly in the case of commercial arrangements. Thus will uncertainty of meaning, as distinct from absence of meaning or of intention, be resolved.' \\n \\n (footnotes omitted)\\n\\n51 The primary duty of a court in construing a written contract is to endeavour to discover the intention of the parties from the words of the instrument in which the contract is embodied. Of course the whole of the instrument has to be considered, since the meaning of any one part of it may be revealed by other parts, and the words of every clause must if possible be construed so as to render them all harmonious one with another. If the words used are unambiguous the court must give effect to them, notwithstanding that the result may appear capricious or unreasonable, and notwithstanding that it may be guessed or suspected that the parties intended something different. The court has no power to remake or amend a contract for the purpose of avoiding a result which is considered to be inconvenient or unjust. On the other hand, if the language is open to two constructions, that will be preferred which will avoid consequences which appear to be capricious, unreasonable, inconvenient or unjust, 'even though the construction adopted is not the most obvious, or the most grammatically accurate', to use the words from earlier authority cited in Locke v. Dunlop ((1888) 39 Ch D 387 at 393), which, although spoken in relation to a will, are applicable to the construction of written instruments generally; see also Bottomley's Case ((1880) 16 Ch D 681 at 686). Further, it will be permissible to depart from the ordinary meaning of the words of one provision so far as is necessary to avoid an inconsistency between that provision and the rest of the instrument. Finally, the statement of Lord Wright in Hillas and Co. Limited. v Arcos Limited. ((1932) 147 LT 503 at 514) that the court should construe commercial contracts 'fairly and broadly, without being too astute or subtle in finding defects', should not be understood as limited to documents drawn by businessmen for themselves and without legal assistance (cf. Upper Hunter County District Council v Australian Chilling and Freezing Co. Ltd . [1968] HCA 8 ; (1968) 118 CLR 429 at 437) (per Gibbs J, as his Honour then was, in Australian Broadcasting Commission v Australasian Performing Right Association Limited [1973] HCA 36 ; (1973) 129 CLR 99 at 109-110) .\",\"7\":\"47 In Whitlock v Brew [1968] HCA 71 ; (1968) 118 CLR 445 the High Court held that a clause concerning the grant of a lease was uncertain for it did not prescribe either the term of the lease or the rent; and further that the provision for arbitration \\\"as to the interpretation and operation\\\" of the clause did not authorise an arbitrator to fix either the rent or the term. It was further held that since the uncertain term was a material and inseverable part of the contract, there was no concluded agreement between the parties. Kitto J at 456 said:\\n \\n '... the document does not record a consensus ad idem as to the duration of the term, the rent, or anything else except the commencing date and the premises intended to be let.' \\n \\n\\nTaylor, Menzies and Owen JJ said at 460-1:\\n \\n 'We are firmly of opinion that the expression \\\"upon such reasonable terms as govern such a lease\\\" is not, in the context in which it appears, apt to refer to either the period for which the contemplated lease is to subsist or to the rent to be payable thereunder. Nor do we think that the further expression \\\"as to the interpretation or operation\\\" of this clause covers a dispute as to either of those matters. We, therefore, are of opinion that the clause is uncertain in that it neither specifies nor provides a means for the determination as between the parties of the period for which the contemplated lease shall be granted or the rent which shall be payable thereunder.' \\n\\n\\n \\nTheir Honours proceeded to deal with the question of severability referring to the judgment of Knox CJ in Life Insurance Co. of Australia Ltd. v. Phillips [1925] HCA 18 ; (1925) 36 CLR 60 at 72 where his Honour said:\\n \\n 'When a contract contains a number of stipulations one of which is void for uncertainty, the question whether the whole contract is void depends on the intention of the parties to be gathered from the instrument as a whole. If the contract be divisible, the part which is void may be separated from the rest and does not affect its validity.'\\n\\n54 In seeking to ascertain the intention of the parties to a written contract extrinsic evidence may not be resorted to except where such evidence may be called in aid in the interpretation of the written instrument. Clearly enough, it is not to the point to make an independent examination of extrinsic facts, even if they were within the knowledge of both parties, and upon such evidence to conclude that a particular provision was or was not of importance to the parties or to either of them. The question for determination is the intention of the parties as disclosed by the contract into which they have entered (per Taylor, Menzies and Owen JJ in Whitlock v Brew at 461).\",\"8\":\"47 In Whitlock v Brew [1968] HCA 71 ; (1968) 118 CLR 445 the High Court held that a clause concerning the grant of a lease was uncertain for it did not prescribe either the term of the lease or the rent; and further that the provision for arbitration \\\"as to the interpretation and operation\\\" of the clause did not authorise an arbitrator to fix either the rent or the term.

If the contract be divisible, the part which is void may be separated from the rest and does not affect its validity.'\",\"9\":\"48 Another illustration of a contract which was held to be void for uncertainty is to be found in Bishop v. Taylor [1968] HCA 68 ; (1968) 118 CLR 518 where a contract for the sale of land included a condition which provided, inter alia, for 'one-third share of crops ... until end of peanut crop in 1968 or end of harvesting period ...' to be paid. The Court held that the condition was void for uncertainty because, upon construing it, one was unable to determine the term of the relevant sub-lease, the type of crop, or what 'one-third share of crops' meant. McTiernan and Taylor JJ said at 523:\\n \\n '... if it was intended that the lease should continue to subsist after the first year it is impossible to say with any degree of certainty for what period it was to subsist. The condition did not specify the nature of the crop or crops which the respondent might plant although, no doubt, it was contemplated that they would be peanuts. But the condition does not restrict him in his choice of crops and it may well be that it was for this reason that the condition provided, in effect, that the lease should subsist \\\"until the end of peanut crop in 1968 or end of harvesting period or as otherwise agreed upon\\\". The duration of the lease, therefore, it seems to us, was to depend upon what sort of crops had been sown for harvesting in 1968 and any agreement to grant a lease with the term so defined, or undefined, is void.' \\n \\n\\nMenzies J said at 525:\\n \\n '... the condition of the contract for a sub-lease from the purchaser to the vendor of some part of the land, the subject of the contract, is one to which it is not possible by a process of construction to give any particular meaning. I agree entirely with what has been said about this condition being void for uncertainty.'\",\"10\":\"49 It is not the subjective beliefs or understandings of the parties about their rights and liabilities that govern their contractual relations. What matters is what each party by words and conduct would have led a reasonable person in the position of the other party to believe. References to the common intention of the parties to a contract are to be understood as referring to what a reasonable person would understand by the language in which the parties have expressed their agreement. The meaning of the terms of a contractual document is to be determined by what a reasonable person would have understood them to mean. That, normally, requires consideration not only of the text, but also of the surrounding circumstances known to the parties, and the purpose and object of the transaction (per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ in Toll (FGCT) Pty Limited v Alphapharm Pty Limited [2004] HCA 52 ; (2004) 219 CLR 165 at 179 [40] ).\",\"11\":\"50 Actual beliefs and intentions are, generally speaking, irrelevant in the determination of the legal rights and obligations flowing from a written agreement (see per Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Kirby, Hayne and Callinan JJ in Equuscorp Pty Ltd v HGT Investments Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 55 ; (2005) 218 CLR 471 at 483 [34] ).\",\"12\":\"51 The primary duty of a court in construing a written contract is to endeavour to discover the intention of the parties from the words of the instrument in which the contract is embodied.

Upper Hunter County District Council v Australian Chilling and Freezing Co. Ltd .

But it is not admissible to contradict the language of the contract when it has a plain meaning. Generally speaking facts existing when the contract was made will not be receivable as part of the surrounding circumstances as an aid to construction, unless they were known to both parties, although, as we have seen, if the facts are notorious knowledge of them will be presumed. \\n \\n It is here that a difficulty arises with respect to the evidence of prior negotiations. Obviously the prior negotiations will tend to establish objective background facts which were known to both parties and the subject matter of the contract. To the extent to which they have this tendency they are admissible. But in so far as they consist of statements and actions of the parties which are reflective of their actual intentions and expectations they are not receivable. The point is that such statements and actions reveal the terms of the contract which the parties intended or hoped to make. They are superseded by, and merged in, the contract itself.

Prima facie there is a resulting trust but where satisfactory proof is forthcoming that a purpose of the transaction was to confer beneficial ownership, the presumption is rebutted (see Russell v Scott ('Russell v Scott') [1936] HCA 34 ; (1936) 55 CLR 440 the case of an aunt who put money into a joint bank account in her name and that of her nephew on the basis that it would be held in trust for the aunt during her lifetime but thereafter the beneficial interest would pass to the nephew).\\n\\n131 Given Mr Ku's evidence that he prepared the 'Change to company details' form, a copy of which is reproduced in Schedule 1, before his meeting with Luke Song on 25 October, that it bears the date 23 October and was handed by Mr Ku to Mr Kim on 24 October with the request that Mr Kim forward it to ASIC in the express post envelope which Mr Ku provided, I have great difficulty in accepting that, when he was speaking with Luke Song on 25 October 2006, he said:\\n \\n 'I will transfer all my shares of Kjun International Pty Ltd to your son first as good gesture if you sign this agreement.' \\n\\n\\n \\nIt is unlikely that he would have used the words mentioned and in particular the word 'if' in circumstances where the 'Change to company details' form had already been prepared, signed and handed to his solicitor Mr Kim for transmission to ASIC in Melbourne.\\n \\nI would place greater emphasis upon the words 'Everyone will say I am the most stupid person doing this but I value more our trust than who is got what and who has the right'. \\n \\nEqually, I have difficulty in accepting that the conversation included the words 'If anything goes wrong I didn't get a single dollar so I can get the shares back'. \\n \\nThis is not a case where a resulting trust should be implied if it be found that the shares were duly transferred by Mr Ku to Ji Song. As was said in Russell v Scott there will be no resulting trust where satisfactory proof is forthcoming that a purpose of the transaction was to confer beneficial ownership.

Furthermore, I am not satisfied that there was any promise on the part of Mr Ku to transfer the shares to Ji Song or that any such promise formed part of an agreement reached between Mr Ku and Luke Song in accordance with the principles enunciated above, for which there was any consideration.

It was not directed at constituting Ji Song a trustee of the shares for Mr Ku. Rather, it was an act of faith, uninfluenced by any representations made by Luke Song or Sue Song.

In Anning Griffith CJ opined at 1057:\\n \\n '... in the case of shares in a company which are only transferable by an instrument of transfer lodged with the company, I think that the donor has done all that is necessary on his part as soon as he has executed the transfer'\\n\\n117 It seems to me that not only would execution of a transfer be necessary, but also delivery of that transfer to the donee and whatever else may be necessary to enable the donee to secure registration of the transfer.\",\"35\":\"202 (a) Whilst the possibility of a transfer of shares from Mr Ku to Ji Song had been the subject of prior discussion, in the context of a possible settlement of the trade mark proceedings, it was raised by Mr Ku for the first time at the Avillion Hotel on 19 October 2006.\\n (b) Mr Ku indicated his intention to transfer the shares to Ji Song with a view to effecting a gift inter vivos of those shares.\\n (c) On 23 October 2006 Mr Ku executed a 'Change to company details' form (see Schedule 1) which he believed would, upon being recorded by ASIC, have the effect of validly transferring the shares to Ji Song.\\n (d) On 24 October 2006 Mr Ku gave the original of the 'Change to company details' form signed by him and dated 23 October 2006 to Mr Kim so that Mr Kim might forward it to ASIC.\\n (e) Mr Kim never forwarded the signed document to ASIC. On or about 9 November 2006 he threw it into his rubbish bin.\\n (f) No proper instrument of transfer of the one share in Kjun International Pty Limited that was held by him as at 23 October 2006 or of any other shares, as required by s 1071B(2) of the Corporations Act , was ever executed by Mr Ku, delivered by him to Ji Song or delivered by him to Kjun International Pty Limited for registration.\\n (g) In accordance with clause 32 of Kjun International Limited's constitution, Mr Ku remained the holder of whatever shares he may have held in Kjun International Pty Limited, notwithstanding his electronic lodgement on 9 November 2006 of the 'Change to company details' form with ASIC (see Schedule 2). The prima facie evidence of a transfer from Mr Ku to Ji Song (under s 1274B(2)) was negated by the evidence that no transfer was ever executed or delivered. This is now common ground.\\n (h) Mr Ku never did everything that was necessary to be done in order to transfer any shares in Kjun International Pty Limited to Ji Song and render himself bound by his intended gift inter vivos.\\n (i) No question of an implied resulting trust or any other form of trust or of a collateral contract to constitute a trust, arises.\\n (j) No mention of Mr Ku's intended gift of the shares or any other shares was made in either form of agreement as signed by Luke Song and Mr Ku on 25 October 2006, even though the common understanding of the parties at that time was that the 'Change to company details' form (Schedule 1) had not been received or recorded by ASIC at that stage.\\n (k) When at the Avillion Hotel on 25 October 2006, Luke Song and Mr Ku considered in detail the terms of the longer form of agreement with a view to effecting a settlement of the trade mark proceedings.\\n (l) They then proceeded to execute the longer form of agreement and also inadvertently signed the shorter form of agreement. Neither party was under the influence of alcohol or unable to read and approve the terms of the agreements which were executed.\\n (m) The parties intended that their execution of the longer form of agreement, but not the shorter form, should give rise to legal relations.\\n (n) At the time of the execution of the longer form of agreement, the proper parties to the trade mark proceedings were:\\n Song interests LSU Pty Limited as trustee of the Nirvana Investment Trust \\n\\nSu-shi World Australia Pty Limited\\n \\nSue Song\\n \\nLuke Song\\n \\n Ku interests Kjun International Pty Limited \\n\\nSushi Nara Australia Pty Limited\\n \\n (o) When Luke Song executed the longer form of agreement he intended to bind not only Su-shi World Australia Pty Limited, Sue Song and Luke Song, but also LSU Pty Limited as trustee of the Nirvana Investment Trust.\\n (p) When Mr Ku executed the longer form of agreement he intended to bind not only Kjun International Pty Limited but also Sushi Nara Australia Pty Limited.\\n (q) It is clear from paragraphs B, D, D [the second D], F and G in the longer form of agreement that Luke Song and Mr Ku intended the party described as 'A' to include all the respondents in the trade mark proceedings and by the party described as 'B' in that form of agreement to include all the applicants in those proceedings.\\n (r) As at 25 October 2006 Luke Song was the sole director of Su-shi World Australia Pty Limited and he, together with Sue Song, were the directors of LSU Pty Limited.\\n (s) In my opinion, it may be inferred that Sue Song authorised Luke Song to enter into a settlement agreement at some time between 19 and 25 October 2006 on her own behalf and also on behalf of LSU Pty Limited and that the longer form of agreement contained terms which were within the scope of Luke Song's authority.\\n (t) As at 25 October 2006 Mr Ku was the sole director of Kjun International Pty Limited and also Sushi Nara Australia Pty Limited. As such, he had authority to bind both of those companies to a settlement agreement.\\n (u) The longer form of agreement was not void for uncertainty. Its terms may be ascertained from the words used in the longer form of agreement and the relevant surrounding circumstances.\\n (v) The reference in clause G of the settlement agreement to the parties' agreement to 'solve all problems harmoniously through a mutual talk and agreement, and help and cooperate with each other for mutual development without slandering each other' did not constitute an agreement to agree. Rather the words were indicative of a promise by the parties to use their respective best endeavours to resolve future disputes that may arise between them by negotiation, bringing to bear goodwill in so doing.\\n (w) The settlement agreement provided for the applicants in the trade mark proceedings to refrain from continuing those proceedings and to refrain from bringing any further claims against the respondents arising out of the disputes between them in relation to the trade mark. It may be inferred that the applicants in the trade mark proceedings agreed to file a notice of discontinuance with the consent of the respondents.\\n (x) The agreement also provided for no claims to be brought by the respondents against the applicants in the trade mark proceedings arising out of those disputes. Whilst the second clause D speaks of ' If \\\"B\\\" withdraws the lawsuit against \\\"A\\\" brought in the Federal Court of Australia New South Wales District Registry, \\\"A\\\" accepts it without reservation and agrees that there will not be any legal proceedings against \\\"B\\\" from \\\"A\\\"' (emphasis added), it is clear from the terms of the agreement and, in particular, the preamble to clause G that by the agreement the parties mutually agreed that they would 'not continue' with their respective claims so that no right was reserved to the respondents in the trade mark proceedings to institute their cross-claim as they did on 9 November 2006, in the absence of a formal notice of discontinuance to be filed by the applicants with the consent of the respondents in the trade mark proceedings.\\n (y) The settlement agreement recognised the rights of Kjun International Pty Limited to the trade mark 'Su-shi World' and the continuation of the licensing arrangement, such as it was, whereby Sushi Nara Australia Pty Limited acted as a franchisor of the 'Sushi World' name. It provided for a recognition of the rights of the parties presently using the 'Sushi World' name in respect of shops, to continue to do so, and it conferred a right on the respondents in the trade mark proceedings to 'open new Sushi World' shops.\\n (z) Notwithstanding the settlement agreement which had been concluded, the respondents, including JHJ Brothers Holdings Pty Limited, filed their cross-claim in the trade mark proceedings on 9 November 2006 and proceeded to serve same on 13 November 2006 (see [27]-[28] above). Furthermore, Ji Song purported to remove Mr Ku as a director, secretary and public officer of Kjun International Pty Limited, replacing him with Sue Song (see Edwin Davey's letter of 15 December 2006). Needless to say, the purported removal and replacement of Mr Ku by Sue Song was of no force and effect given that Ji Song never became the holder of any shares in Kjun International Pty Limited.\\n (aa) By their conduct in filing and serving the cross-claim as they did, the respondents in the trade mark proceedings repudiated the settlement agreement reached on 25 October 2006. That repudiation was accepted by the applicants in the trade mark proceedings on 18 December 2006 thereby terminating the settlement agreement.\\n (bb) In the circumstances, the restraints imposed upon the parties in relation to continuing the trade mark proceedings, whether as applicants or cross-claimants, came to an end with the consequence that the trade mark proceedings may now proceed to a hearing.\\n (cc) None of the conduct engaged in by any of the Songs or Su-shi World Australia Pty Limited whether by action or omission constituted misleading and deceptive conduct or conduct likely to mislead or deceive. The circumstances which prevailed between 25 October and 9 November 2006 did not give rise to an obligation on the part of the Songs or any of them to disclose any intention that they may have had to file a cross-claim on 9 November 2006 nor did the circumstances give rise to an obligation upon them or any of them to disclose the fact that the cross-claim had been filed following its filing on 9 November 2006 and before its service on 13 November 2006 (see Henjo Investments Pty Limited v Collins Marrickville Pty Limited (1988) 79 ALR 83 at 94-5).\\n (dd) Su-shi World Australia Pty Limited did not engage in any unconscionable conduct within the meaning of s 51AA of the Trade Practices Act .\\n\\n203 In the foregoing circumstances, the applicant in the current proceedings has failed in respect of the claims as articulated in paragraphs 1 4 and 5 8 of the Second Further Amended Application filed on 6 August 2007. However, he is entitled to a declaration that the third respondent has no right, title or interest in any shares in the fourth respondent and also a declaration that the purported removal of the applicant as a director, secretary and public officer of the fourth respondent and the purported replacement of the applicant as a director, secretary and public officer of the fourth respondent by the first respondent, by the third respondent's resolution signed and dated 15 December 2006, was of no force and effect.\\n\\n204 Given the basis upon which the case has been decided and the late emergence of evidence, which, if addressed prior to the commencement of the proceedings, may have obviated the need for the proceedings, the question of costs should be reserved for later decision. I propose to direct that the parties file and serve written submissions thereon within 7 days.\\n \\n\\n Schedule 1 \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n Schedule 2 \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n I certify that the preceding two hundred and four (204) numbered paragraphs and two (2) Schedules are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Graham. \\n\\n\\n Associate:\\n\\nDated: 8 August 2007\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Counsel for the Applicant: R J Webb SC and S Fendekian \\n \\n Solicitor for the Applicant: Darryl Barlow & Company \\n \\n Counsel for the First, Second, Third and Fifth Respondents: R K Weaver and S Chrysanthou \\n \\n Solicitor for the First, Second, Third and Fifth Respondents: Edwin Davey Commercial & Litigation Lawyers \\n \\n The Fourth Respondent submitted to such orders as the Court may seem fit. \\n \\n Dates of Hearing: 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19 June, 10 July and 6 August 2007 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 8 August 2007 \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2007\\/1189.html\"}}"
