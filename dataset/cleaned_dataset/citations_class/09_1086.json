It may be understood to mean a hearing conducted as if there never had been a hearing before the judicial registrar, everything concerning that hearing being completely ignored. Alternatively, it may be understood to mean no more than a hearing at which the parties are not bound by the course they took before the judicial registrar, where they have the right to adduce such further evidence as they wish, perhaps to adopt positions and put contentions different from those adopted before, and put to, the judicial registrar; and, of course, where the judge is not bound by the judicial registrar's findings of fact. Like Moore J, I think a review hearing is a \\\"hearing de novo\\\" in the latter sense. A hearing conducted in that way answers the constitutional requirement described by Mason CJ and Deane J, \\\"a hearing and a determination by a judge\\\", without forcing on the parties, as a matter of necessity in all cases, the burden of relitigating all issues. \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n There may be occasions when it will be appropriate to conduct the review hearing as if there had never been an earlier hearing, perhaps because the earlier hearing so miscarried that the evidence became confused and the findings irrelevant or there is so much new evidence that it swamps the earlier.

Where parties make a conscientious effort to adduce the relevant evidence at a properly conducted first hearing, by the end of that hearing they will ordinarily have found considerable common ground. It will have become apparent that some issues, on which they initially had inconsistent positions, are irrelevant or peripheral. They will have dropped out of the case. Differences of evidence on other issues will have been reconciled or explained; it may have become apparent to everyone that one particular version of events is more likely to be correct than its competitor. It would be unfortunate indeed if constitutional necessity compelled the court to ignore this narrowing of the dispute. I do not think it does. The relevant constitutional principle means no more than that, on review, the parties are entitled to have the case reviewed by the judge, without any limitation imposed by the conduct of the case before the judicial registrar or the judicial registrar's findings. The parties have the right to call such additional evidence as they wish, subject to relevance and other usual canons of admissibility. The judge must decide the relevant facts for himself or herself, and not simply adopt the findings of the judicial registrar. But the principle does not require the parties to ignore the evidence tendered to the judicial registrar; on the contrary it will ordinarily be sensible for that evidence to be tendered to the judge conducting the review. \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n In most cases, by the review stage, the critical factual issues will be few and well-defined.

Directions were made for the filing of such evidence as was considered by the parties to be appropriate and for that material to be the subject of written submissions filed in advance of a hearing in Court. The materials filed included extensive extracts of the transcript of the proceedings before Branson J and copies of the submissions previously filed.

Rather, the more appropriate course was to allow Counsel to identify those factual or legal matters which they wished to have resolved by this Court relevant to the \\\" inquiry \\\" which had been ordered.\",\"5\":\"For the purposes of undertaking that \\\" hearing \\\" it is fortunately unnecessary to re-state each of the previous decisions and the disputes thereby resolved. For present purposes it is sufficient to note that on 11 March 2002 Beaumont J made orders by consent, including the following two orders: \\n \\n 1. Warren Pantzer as Trustee of the estate of Thomas Richard Wenkart may recover his remuneration, costs, charges and expenses to which he is lawfully entitled or may become lawfully entitled from Thomas Richard Wenkart and Thomas Richard Wenkart agrees to pay the same within 28 days of determination of the quantum of the same or at such other time as the parties may agree.\\n ... \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n 5. Thomas Richard Wenkart consents to Warren Pantzer lodging a Caveat over the property in paragraph 2 for the purpose of securing the charge in paragraph 2 and Warren Pantzer will upon payment of the remuneration, costs, charges and expenses in paragraph 1 provide a Withdrawal of Caveat forthwith. \\n \\n\\n \\nThe property identified in order 5 above is located in Union St, Paddington (\\\"the Paddington property\\\"). The correct construction of these orders has been considered by the Full Court: Pantzer v Wenkart [2006] FCAFC 140 , 153 FCR 466.\\n\\nIt is also sufficient for present purposes to further note that on 31 October 2002, Mr Pantzer filed in this Court what was later deemed to be a cross-claim whereby he sought \\\" an order in aid of [the Court's] order made 11 March 2002 by appointing Warren Pantzer as Trustee for Sale of [the Paddington property] \\\".\\n\\nThe difficulty confronting Mr Pantzer, however, was that: the total amount he had received as trustee of Dr Wenkart's estate was $769,191.66 \\nbut that:\\n the total amount of authorised payments made by Mr Pantzer to himself by way of remuneration prior to 31 October 2002 was $325,744.60. \\nThere had been no agreement as to the \\\" remuneration, costs, charges and expenses to which \\\" Mr Pantzer was entitled in excess of that which had been then authorised. No occasion had thus arisen as at 31 October 2002, the date the deemed cross-claim was filed, for him to seek to exercise his rights as against the Paddington property.\",\"6\":\"A further competing submission addressed by both Counsel on behalf of Dr Wenkart and Mr Pantzer should be noted.

This rule was stated by Sargant J in Re Peruvian Railway Construction Company Ltd [1915] 2 Ch 144 at 150 as follows: \\n \\n ... [W]here a person entitled to participate in a fund is also bound to make a contribution in aid of that fund, he cannot be allowed so to participate unless and until he has fulfilled his duty to contribute. \\n \\n\\n \\nGiven the constraint imposed upon the Deputy District Registrar when conducting her \\\" inquiry \\\", namely that \\\" [t]he appropriate time for the determination of questions of interest \\\" was at a later date, this present submission need not be further considered.\\n\\nA review of all of the materials to which the Court has been referred does not lead to any different conclusion being reached to that set forth in the Certificate .

Mr Pantzer has therefore failed to demonstrate that, as at the date of the filing of his cross-claim, he was entitled to \\\"orders in aid\\\" of the consent orders made on 11 March 2002. \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n [92] Nonetheless, I do not accept the submission of Dr Wenkart that it would be appropriate simply to dismiss the cross-claim with costs. Were this course adopted Mr Pantzer could simply institute a fresh application seeking to enforce the charge over the Paddington property. The regrettably long and complex history of this matter renders such an outcome even more undesirable than might ordinarily be the case. The appropriate way to deal with the premature filing of Mr Pantzer's cross-claim is, in my view, by the making of appropriate costs orders. This will require, as a first step, the identification of the date, if any, on which 28 days had passed from the determination of the quantum of an amount by way of remuneration, costs, charges and expenses to which Mr Pantzer is lawfully entitled that resulted in the aggregate of such determinations exceeding $769,191.66 (ie the total amount received by Mr Pantzer as trustee of Dr Wenkart's estate). If the parties are unable to reach agreement on this question, I propose to make an order for the making of an inquiry by a Registrar (O 39 r 2 and r 9 of the Federal Court Rules ). \\n \\n\\n \\nHer Honour had also earlier published in October 2007 reasons for decision relevant to the remuneration and costs of the trustee: Wenkart v Pantzer (No 10) [2007] FCA 1589.\\n\\nThis table, it is considered, correctly sets forth as the starting point the sum of $769,191.66. Reference had been made by Branson J to an alternative figure of $797,000: [2008] FCA 478 at [6] . But this alternative figure was apparently an error attributable to submissions by Senior Counsel previously appearing for Dr Wenkart. Nothing turns on this error, it being accepted by both Counsel that the correct sum is that identified in the Certificate . The sum of $769,191.66 was the sum identified by Her Honour when making the order that an \\\" inquiry \\\" be undertaken.\\n\\nAnd, other than a slight variation as to the dates upon which payments had been made in March 2000, there was also no disagreement on the part of Dr Wenkart as to the payments of $60,744.30, $80,000.00, $11,811.40 or $68,188.60 as identified in the table.\\n\\nOne \\\" objection \\\" taken on behalf of Dr Wenkart, however, focussed upon the two sums of $105,000 paid on 15 March 2002. One sum of $105,000 was identified as \\\" trustee remuneration \\\" and the other sum was identified as the payment of legal fees to Cutler Hughes and Harris.\",\"10\":\"The present proceeding arises out of an order made by Branson J in September 2008 that an inquiry be held pursuant to O 39 r 2 of the Federal Court Rules : Wenkart v Pantzer [2008] FCA 1387. An inquiry was held and a Certificate subsequently issued by a Deputy District Registrar on 28 May 2009. An \\\" objection \\\" has been taken to this Certificate and the present proceeding before the Court is a \\\" hearing \\\" pursuant to O 39 r 10(3) of the Federal Court Rules .\\n\\nSubsequent to the publication of those reasons for decision, two Notices of Motion were filed on behalf of Dr Wenkart seeking that further consideration be given by the Court to some of the conclusions then reached. One Notice of Motion was filed on 2 June and another on 5 June 2008. Her Honour dismissed both Motions in September 2008: [2008] FCA 1387. In doing so, Her Honour expressed her conclusions and made orders as follows: \\n \\n CONCLUSION \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n [30] The parties have not reached an agreement as to the date, if any, on which 28 days had passed from the determination of the quantum of an amount by way of remuneration, costs, charges and expenses to which Mr Pantzer is lawfully entitled from Dr Wenkart that resulted in the aggregate of such determinations exceeding the total amount received by Mr Pantzer as trustee of Dr Wenkart's estate. On the approach that I have considered, and continue to consider, it appropriate to adopt, before final orders can be made on Mr Pantzer's cross-claim it is necessary to know when, if at all, Mr Pantzer became entitled to enforce the charge over Dr Wenkart's Paddington property reflected in order 2 of the consent orders made by Beaumont J on 11 March 2002. It will therefore be ordered that a Registrar conduct an inquiry to determine that date. When that date has been identified it will be necessary for the parties to have the opportunity of making further submissions as to orders, including orders for costs, appropriate to be made on Mr Pantzer's cross-claim. \\n \\n\\n \\nHer Honour's orders were as follows:\\n \\n \\n 1. The applications made pursuant to the notices of motion filed on 2 June 2008 and 5 June 2008 respectively be dismissed.\\n 2. A Registrar conduct an inquiry to determine the date, if any, on which 28 days had passed from the determination of the quantum of an amount by way of remuneration, costs, charges and expenses to which Mr Pantzer is lawfully entitled from Dr Wenkart that resulted in the aggregate of such determinations exceeding $769,191.66.\\n 3. The proceeding be otherwise stood over to a date to be fixed.\\n\\nConsequent upon this decision of Branson J, Deputy District Registrar Hannigan conducted the inquiry which had been ordered and issued her Certificate in May 2009. That Certificate stated as follows: \\n \\n Certificate pursuant to Order 39 Rule 10 of the Federal Court Rules . \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n I, Paddy Hannigan, a Deputy District Registrar of the Federal Court of Australia certify that the date, if any, on which 28 days had passed from the determination of the quantum of an amount by way of remuneration, costs, charges and expenses to which Mr. Pantzer is lawfully entitled from Dr. Wenkart that resulted in the aggregate of such determinations exceeding $769,191.66 is 10 January 2005.\\n\\nOrder 1 r 4 of the Federal Court Rules , it should perhaps be noted, defines \\\" Registrar \\\" as including \\\" a Deputy District Registrar \\\". The functions and manner of appointment of Registrars are addressed in Part IIA , Div 1 and 2 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).\\n\\nCounsel on behalf of Mr Pantzer took a more confined view as to the task presently confronting the Court. She maintained that the Certificate should be given such weight that the Court should conclude that the date calculated by the Deputy District Registrar (namely 10 January 2005) was the date on which the 28 day period referred to in the order of Beaumont J as made on 11 March 2002 expired. Counsel on behalf of Mr Pantzer further maintained that the only task confronting the Court when conducting the \\\" hearing \\\" provided for in O 39 r 10 was the task of determining the \\\" weight \\\" to be given to the Certificate . Excluded from consideration, on this approach, was any task of revisiting the orders as made by Branson J or the constraints imposed by Her Honour upon those who were to carry out the \\\" inquiry \\\". Indeed, on this approach, and given the findings as made by Branson J, the task performed by the Deputy District Registrar was a simple mathematical calculation of amounts and the correlation of expenditure with dates. The confined nature of the current \\\" hearing \\\", it was contended, was not only dictated by the terms of O 39 r 10 but also by the fact that Branson J had herself been previously asked to revisit the findings she had made and declined to do so in her September 2008 judgment: [2008] FCA 1387.\\n\\nThe utility of ordering such an inquiry to be undertaken was queried. But the inquiry having been undertaken and the date identified, the outstanding task according to Counsel for Mr Pantzer was now for this Court to conduct a \\\" hearing \\\" confined to the resolution of such \\\" objections \\\" as were now properly sought to be raised for consideration. Dr Wenkart had sought such a \\\" hearing \\\", as is his entitlement under O 39 r 10(3) of the Federal Court Rules . That \\\" hearing \\\" and that \\\" hearing \\\" alone, it was contended, should now proceed. Whatever subsequent appeals may be filed or other applications made all remained matters for another day.\\n\\nThe fundamental divergence of approach exposed by the exchange of written submissions thus focussed upon those matters which could be canvassed and resolved in a \\\" hearing \\\" conducted for the purposes of O 39 r 10(3). It is considered that the more wide-ranging \\\" hearing \\\" envisaged by Counsel on behalf of Dr Wenkart is to be rejected.\",\"11\":\"As concluded by Branson J in her reasons for decision in April 2008 ( Wenkart v Pantzer [2008] FCA 478): \\n \\n [91] I conclude that as at the date that the cross-claim was filed, Mr Pantzer, in his capacity as trustee of Dr Wenkart's bankrupt estate, had received a larger amount by way of receipts than the determined quantum of the remuneration, costs, charges and expenses to which he was lawfully entitled. Mr Pantzer has therefore failed to demonstrate that, as at the date of the filing of his cross-claim, he was entitled to \\\"orders in aid\\\" of the consent orders made on 11 March 2002. \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n [92] Nonetheless, I do not accept the submission of Dr Wenkart that it would be appropriate simply to dismiss the cross-claim with costs. Were this course adopted Mr Pantzer could simply institute a fresh application seeking to enforce the charge over the Paddington property. The regrettably long and complex history of this matter renders such an outcome even more undesirable than might ordinarily be the case. The appropriate way to deal with the premature filing of Mr Pantzer's cross-claim is, in my view, by the making of appropriate costs orders. This will require, as a first step, the identification of the date, if any, on which 28 days had passed from the determination of the quantum of an amount by way of remuneration, costs, charges and expenses to which Mr Pantzer is lawfully entitled that resulted in the aggregate of such determinations exceeding $769,191.66 (ie the total amount received by Mr Pantzer as trustee of Dr Wenkart's estate). If the parties are unable to reach agreement on this question, I propose to make an order for the making of an inquiry by a Registrar (O 39 r 2 and r 9 of the Federal Court Rules ). \\n \\n\\n \\nHer Honour had also earlier published in October 2007 reasons for decision relevant to the remuneration and costs of the trustee: Wenkart v Pantzer (No 10) [2007] FCA 1589.\"}}"
