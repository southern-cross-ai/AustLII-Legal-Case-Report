"{\"id\":{\"0\":\"c0\"},\"class\":{\"0\":\"cited\"},\"tocase\":{\"0\":\"Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v 1Cellnet LLC [2005] FCA 856\"},\"text\":{\"0\":\"9 An applicant for an order under Order 35A does not have to prove its claim by way of evidence. It is sufficient that, on the face of the statement of claim, there is a claim for the relief sought and that it appears that the Court has jurisdiction to grant that relief: see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v 1Cellnet LLC [2005] FCA 856 at [14] .\\n\\n10 I am satisfied that each of the respondents is in default by reason of his or its failure to file a defence and to attend directions hearings. The orders sought should be made.\\n\\n11 On 3 January 2008 the applicant obtained orders from Ryan J against two other respondents (the twentieth and twenty-first respondents) which were conditioned by a requirement that the applicant provide security for an undertaking which it gave to his Honour on that day. It was ordered that $150,000 be paid into and held in the trust account maintained by the applicant's solicitors. On 2 April 2008 the Court made orders by consent that the orders made by Ryan J on 3 January 2008 be vacated. The proceeding, insofar as it involved the applicant and the twentieth and twenty-first respondents was discontinued. In these circumstances the applicant applies to recover the $150,000 which remains in the solicitor's trust account. There being no further requirement for such security to be provided the order should be made.\\n\\n I certify that the preceding eleven (11) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice TRACEY. \\n\\n\\nAssociate:\\n\\nDated: 10 October 2008\\n\\n Counsel for the Applicant: Mr E Heerey \\n \\n Solicitor for the Applicant: Middletons \\n\\n Dates of Hearing: 28 August 2008, 1 October 2008, 7 October 2008 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 10 October 2008 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2008\\/1514.html\"}}"
