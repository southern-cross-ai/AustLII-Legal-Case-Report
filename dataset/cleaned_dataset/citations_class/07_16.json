It is generally expected that the same expression in different provisions of an enactment will bear the same meaning: see e.g. per Mason J in Registrar of Titles of the State of Western Australia v Franzon [1975] HCA 41 ; (1975) 132 CLR 611 at 618. What s 7C(3) requires to constitute a determination in writing by the Board must however be ascertained having regard to the purposes of that particular provision, and the absence of any legislative prescription other than s 7G as to how the Board may do so, and the absence of any provision for the Board to have a common seal. In the circumstances, I do not think my conclusion reflects any inconsistency in the use of the requirement of a determination in writing in the provisions of the Act.

Consequently, it was accepted that notwithstanding s 16, if the Board had not complied with those prescribed procedures, it had no jurisdiction to make the determination in the terms of the instrument: see Plaintiff S157\\/2002 v The Commonwealth [2003] HCA 2 ; (2003) 211 CLR 476.\\n\\n51 It is also strictly unnecessary to consider whether the privative clause in s 16 of the Act would prevent the applicants from challenging the validity of the warrants on the ground that they did not comply with s 22 of the Act. I have rejected their primary contention based on s 22. Section 16 purports to protect any \\\"act or thing done by the ACC\\\" from review on the ground that a determination under s 7C(3) was not lawfully made. Argument on this point focussed on whether the \\\"act or thing\\\" being challenged was an \\\"act or thing done by the ACC\\\", or an act or thing done by the issuing officer (who, it was agreed, is not part of the ACC). However, in relation to this argument, in any event, s 16 is apparently inapplicable because the particular complaint that the material provided to the issuing officer was inadequate is not necessarily premised on the proposition that the determination itself was not lawfully made.\\n\\n I certify that the preceding fifty-one (51) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Mansfield. \\n\\n\\n Associate:\\n\\nDated: 22 January 2007\\n\\n\\n Counsel for the Applicant: ML Abbott QC and CD Bleby \\n \\n Solicitor for the Applicant: Patsouris & Associates \\n \\n Counsel for the Respondent: SJ Maharaj QC and R Prince \\n \\n Solicitor for the Respondent: Australian Crime Commission \\n \\n Date of Hearing: 15 November 2006 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 25 January 2007 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2007\\/16.html\"}}"
