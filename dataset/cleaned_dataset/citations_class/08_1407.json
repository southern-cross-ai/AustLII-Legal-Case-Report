Upon the chair rests the responsibility for making rulings as to the validity of matters. Some of those matters will be entirely procedural such as decisions concerning the putting of resolutions to the meeting. Others will involve determining an entitlement such as whether a member may vote by proxy having regard to a challenge to the validity of the proxy instrument, compliance with lodgement procedure or by reason of some other deficiency or restriction. The chair may foreshadow a ruling and entertain objections and discussion before deciding the question or invite discussion, then rule and note objections to the ruling.\",\"1\":\"68 In the course of considering an entitlement asserted by a member or a member's proxy as to particular subject matter giving rise to a ruling, facts may need to be considered by the chair. Those facts may be relevant matters known by the chair by reason of circumstances surrounding the calling of a meeting or facts learnt in the course of the meeting or a combination of fact-finding circumstances. Some such facts, in another context, have been described as 'emergent questions, questions of fact that have to be decided then and there' ( McLean Bros. & Rigg Ltd v Grice [1906] HCA 1 ; (1906) 4 CLR 835 at 860 per Barton J). A chair engaged in the conduct of a meeting is not in a position to undertake a 'voir dire' as to emergent factual contentions. He or she must hear the contentions of fact going to the question and decide the immediate question. A chair is not required to act judicially in deciding these questions before him or her. The chair is required to act 'bona fide' ( Corpique (No. 20) v Eastcourt (1989) 15 ACLR 586 at 596 per Cohen J) or at least in a way that is not 'neglectful' ( Corpique , per Cohen J at 596). On a question of whether the chair of a meeting of relevant members of a corporation, convened to consider a scheme of arrangement, had given members sufficient opportunity to debate the merits of the scheme, McLelland J, in Direct Acceptance Corporation Ltd (1987) 5 ACLC 1037 at 1041, said, 'However, on such a matter as this, the chairman as a matter of law has a wide discretion with which the court will not interfere unless the exercise of that discretion can be shown to be invalid, e.g. on the ground that it was exercised in bad faith' . In Fast Scout Ltd v Bergel & Ors (2001) 40 ACSR 376 , Templeman J considered, in the context of a ruling relating to the validity of proxies, that 'generally, a chairman's decision will be amenable to review by the court if he makes an error of law' . Assuming the chair has exercised the jurisdiction conferred upon him by the meeting and the relevant instruments in good faith, the notion that his or her decision will be amenable to review on a ground of error of law although supported by established authority is more recently supported by a decision of the Court of Appeal of Victoria in Link Agricultural Pty Ltd v Shanahan & Ors [1998] VSCA 3 ; (1998) 28 ACSR 498. Kenny JA with whom Batt JA and Buchanan J agreed, accepted that the powers exercisable by the chair are not unfettered and 'broadly speaking' the powers could not be exercised 'unlawfully' to deprive members of their votes (Kenny JA at 511). The decision taken by the chair to refuse Shanahan extra time to lodge his 'proxy holder card' after a particular deadline with the result that proxy voters lost the benefit of their right to vote, failed a test of legality [my term] because the chair's decision was not taken for the purpose of the power conferred by the Act (Kenny JA at pp 512 and 513). Kenny JA put the test in these terms, 'Whether or not there was error in the chairman's ruling depends on whether it was made in good faith and for [the] purpose. The ruling will be invalid if made in bad faith or for an ulterior or impermissible purpose' (Kenny JA at p 511). In Perera v Reilly (2006) 59 ACSR 317 , Murray J considered the intersection between s 253G of the Act and the approach to supervisory review of decisions of a chair of the meeting and said this:\\n \\n \\n [45] The provision is designed to facilitate the despatch of corporate business by decisions taken at meetings.

In Byng v London Life Association Ltd [1990] 1 Ch 170; [1989] 1 All ER 560, the Court of Appeal applying Wednesbury principles held that a chair exercising powers as chair at a meeting of members of a public company would fall into error of law if the chair, on facts which he knew or ought to have known, failed to take into account all relevant factors, took into account irrelevant factors or reached a conclusion which no reasonable chair properly directing himself or herself to the chair's duties could have reached. Sir Nicholas Browne-Wilkinson, VC observed that the chair's decision 'must also be taken reasonably with a view to facilitating the purpose for which the power exists' ( Byng per Browne-Wilkinson, VC at p 189). In that sense, the question of whether the power is exercised reasonably is a function of the question of whether the decision facilitates the purpose for which the power was conferred. That is an error of law test.\\n\\n72 If the approach to judicial review of administrative decisions is an applicable analogue for judicial review of decisions of a chair of a meeting of scheme members, having regard in part to the contextual provisions of the Act within which the chair of such a meeting discharges his or her role, the question to be determined in examining conclusions of fact or a process of reasoning leading to a conclusion of fact is whether there is any evidence before the chair upon which the decision could have been made irrespective of whether the Court would have reached that decision or drawn the same inference. However, care must be exercised when applying the authorities as they go to the exercise of the jurisdiction itself.\\n\\n73 The position derived from the authorities on this question seems to me to be this.\",\"10\":\"74 Describing a process of reasoning as irrational, illogical or based upon an unsound approach to the assessment of a document (for example) or that findings are not based on inferences of fact supported on logical grounds, may merely be an emphatic way of disagreeing with a finding of fact ( Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Applicant S20\\/2002 [2003] HCA 30 ; (2003) 198 ALR 59 per Gleeson CJ at [5]). It is necessary therefore to precisely identify the 'nature and quality' of the error of the administrative decision-maker and the legal principle that attracts a particular legal consequence, such as error of law, that is, the 'legal rubric under which a decision is challenged' ( MIMA; Ex parte S20\\/2002 per Gleeson CJ at [9]).

The question of whether there is evidence of a fact is a question of law and whether an inference can be drawn from facts is itself a question of law. In Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Al-Miahi [2001] FCA 744 ; (2001) 65 ALD 141 , Sundberg, Emmett and Finkelstein JJ, said this:\\n \\n \\n [34] The question whether there is any evidence of a particular fact is a question of law. Likewise, the question whether a particular inference can be drawn from facts found or agreed is a question of law. That is because, before the inference is drawn, there is a preliminary question as to whether the evidence reasonably admits a different conclusion. Accordingly, in the context of judicial review, the making of findings and the drawing of inferences in the absence of evidence is an error of law. On the other hand, there is no error of law simply in making a wrong finding of fact. Even if the reasoning whereby the court reached its conclusion of fact were demonstrably unsound, that would not amount to an error of law. A party does not establish an error of law by showing that the decision-maker inferred the existence of a particular fact by a faulty process, for example by engaging in an illogical course of reasoning. Thus, at common law, want of logic is not synonymous with error of law.
