It made its judgment of the significance, seriousness and, in the case of the threats, the purpose of the conduct in question. As Sundberg J said in Das v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural Affairs (2004) 208 ALR 229 at [23]: \\\"That the Court might not itself have taken the same view of the facts as the Tribunal does not establish error\\\". No reviewable error has been disclosed.\\n\\n28 Distinctly, the appellant claims that the Tribunal misunderstood the \\\"official quality\\\" that may be required in the course of persecution such as to constitute a person a refugee under the Convention. I already have indicated that the Tribunal's understanding of what was comprehended by the \\\"official quality\\\" requirement as expressly explained in its Reasons, was orthodox and unobjectionable. Before referring again to this matter towards the end of its reasons, the Tribunal found that despite his fears of harm at the hands of UNP supporters, the appellant could access and be provided with adequate State protection. It is in this context that its comments on \\\"official quality\\\" are to be considered when it indicated that the harm the appellant fears from UNP supporters did not have an official quality.\",\"10\":\"29 On a fair reading of the Tribunal's reasons, it is apparent that the Tribunal was intending to signify that such violence as occurs between members or supporters of political parties (which was the essence of the appellant's claims about the UNP supporters) did not amount to persecution, first because such violence was not official, or officially tolerated or uncontrollable by the State and secondly, because it lacked the selective or discriminatory quality which is inherent in the notion of persecution. While each of these reasons was sufficient to justify a conclusion adverse to the appellant, the latter, the State protection finding, was independently dispositive of the appellant's entire claim in the circumstances: Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs v Respondent S152\\/2003 (2004) 205 ALR 487; SZBOT v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 411 ; Applicant VFAH v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1018.\",\"11\":\"29 On a fair reading of the Tribunal's reasons, it is apparent that the Tribunal was intending to signify that such violence as occurs between members or supporters of political parties (which was the essence of the appellant's claims about the UNP supporters) did not amount to persecution, first because such violence was not official, or officially tolerated or uncontrollable by the State and secondly, because it lacked the selective or discriminatory quality which is inherent in the notion of persecution.

A subsidiary basis for opposition based on comments made in the joint judgment in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Epeabaka [2001] HCA 23 ; (2001) 206 CLR 128 at [29] concerning the significance of lapse of time is to the following effect. Given the member's views were published more than a year after the decision in question, it cannot be determined what the member's views may have been at the time of decision. This latter contention is not, in my view, of particular consequence. The article was published in a law journal in a foreign country. Inevitably that process would have involved delay. It is equally clear from the structure of the article, the sources relied upon, and the nature of the debate with which it was engaging, that time was spent in its research and writing. It is improbable that its central thesis was not entertained by the Tribunal member, if only in rudimentary form, at the time when the appellant's review application was determined.\\n\\n38 Given the view I take on the question of leave, it is necessary to refer in a little detail to the burden of the article itself (which runs to thirty-five pages). There are two comments I should make about it by way of preface. The first is that the article's concern is not with torture at large (i.e. the infliction of severe pain, suffering or torment as such). Rather it is with a particular sub-species of State-sanctioned or officially authorised torture (i.e. the State-sanctioned infliction of bodily pain etc for the purpose of persuading a person to provide information to avert a grave risk of loss of life). I note in passing that the definitions of \\\"torture\\\" in The Oxford English Dictionary , vol XVIII, 278 (2 nd ed) reflect the above differences to the extent of recognising that torture may or may not be inflicted purposively and with State authority.\\n\\n39 The second comment is that the background to the article are the contemporary prevalence of State-sanctioned torture in many countries and its use by States for interrogative purposes.\\n\\n43 First, reasonably apprehended bias .
