That report proposed the removal of restrictions requiring approvals to be obtained from the Court on various matters by liquidators and trustees in bankruptcy. It also proposed, that restrictions requiring prior approvals should be placed on, inter alia, \\\"the power to enter into long term commitments such as the mortgaging or leasing of property of the insolvent\\\" (Report Vol 1, [608]). That purpose was reflected in the Explanatory Memorandum for the 1992 Bill and led Austin J to conclude in Corporate Affairs Commission v ASC Timber Pty Ltd (1998) 16 ACLC 1,642 (at 1,649): \\n \\n It appears, therefore, that the purpose of s 477(2B) is, in the Harmer Report's words, to restrict the unfettered exercise of powers which may not be conducive to an expeditious and beneficial administration. That suggests that the role of the court, the committee of inspection or the creditors (as the case may be) is to review the liquidator's proposal by reference to those criteria. The role of the approving body, at any rate where that body is a court, is to grant or deny approval to the liquidator's proposal rather than to develop some alternative proposal which might seem to be preferable.\",\"1\":\"35 In Empire (Aust) Nominees Pty Ltd v Vince (2000) 18 ACLC 738, the liquidators of the company had entered into an agreement with a litigation funder which should have had prior approval under s 477(2B). The failure to obtain approval was innocent and based upon ignorance and oversight. Warren J said (at [14]):\\n \\n I adopt a similar view to that expressed by Templeman J in Re Associated Travel [ Leisure and Services Ltd (In Liquidation) [1978] 1 WLR 547] that either under the statute, in this case s 479(3) of the Law or pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction of the court approval may be granted as sought by the liquidator in the present matter. \\n \\n\\nHer Honour went on to refer to s 1322(4)(a) and added (at [15]): \\n \\n \\n I note, further, that s 1322(4)(d) of the Law empowers the court to order an extension of the period for doing any act, matter or thing under the Law, including an order extending a period where the period concerned ended before the application for the order was made and that the court may make such consequential or ancillary orders as it thinks fit.\\n\\n37 Re Associated Travel, Leisure & Services Ltd [1978] 1 WLR 547 was a case in which a liquidator appointed solicitors without the prior sanction of the court or a committee of inspection as required by s 245(1) of the Companies Act 1948 (UK). In retrospectively approving the appointment, Templeman J relied upon s 246(3) of that Act to give directions to the liquidator. In the alternative he relied upon the \\\"inherent powers\\\" of the court. In Re HIH Insurance Group Ltd [2000] NSWCA 374 ; (2001) 19 ACLC 1,102, Hamilton J relied upon Re Associated Travel 1 WLR 547 and Empire (Aust) Nominees Pty Ltd 18 ACLC 738 for the proposition that an approval under s 477(2B) could be \\\"given by the court retrospectively\\\" (at [6]).\\n\\n39 With respect to the different conclusions reached in Empire (Aust) Nominees Pty Ltd 18 ACLC 738 and Stewart, in the matter of Newtronics Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1375 , I do not consider that s 1322(4)(d) can be relied upon to extend time under s 477(2B).\\n\\n40 The general power of the Court to give directions to a liquidator under s 479(3) of the Act will, in my opinion, also allow the Court to approve the liquidator proceeding under an agreement made without the requisite prior approval under s 477(2B). Further, and equivalent to the inherent jurisdiction of the State Supreme Courts, relied upon in Empire (Aust) Nominees Pty Ltd 18 ACLC 738, is the implied incidental power of this Court to make orders which are necessarily incidental to its express powers. In Jackson v Sterling Industries Ltd [1987] HCA 23 ; (1987) 162 CLR 612, Deane J (Mason CJ, agreeing) quoted with approval the statement by Bowen CJ in the Full Court of the Federal Court, under appeal (at 623-624): \\n \\n In relation to a statutory court such as the Federal Court it is wise to avoid the use of the words 'inherent jurisdiction'.

In view of the general attitude in the Harmer Report that, subject to the particular fetters spelt out in the legislation, liquidators should be given fairly free rein to conduct the winding up.
