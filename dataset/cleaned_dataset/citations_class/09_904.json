The Tribunal had affirmed a decision of a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship ( the delegate ) to refuse to grant protection visas to the appellants.\\n\\nThe appellants are husband and wife. Only the first appellant (the husband) appeared before me today. There was no appearance by his wife although the first appellant informed me that he was speaking for his wife. I shall hereafter refer to the first appellant as the husband .\\n\\nBefore the Tribunal the second appellant indicated that she did not have an individual claim to be a refugee and that she was applying as a member of her husband's family. It appears that that has remained the position both before the Federal Magistrate and in this Court.\",\"1\":\"This ground is merely a repetition of a similar ground argued before the Federal Magistrate. It is an attempt to re-agitate the merits which, of course, is not permissible in this appeal. The approach which the Federal Magistrate took to this ground was correct. Indeed, a fair reading of the Tribunal's decision supports the proposition that the approach which the Tribunal took to the question embedded in this ground of appeal was also correct. This Court cannot engage in fact-finding about the merits of the administrative decision under review (see NAHI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 10 ; and Kopalapillai v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [1998] FCA 1126 ; (1998) 86 FCR 547).\",\"2\":\"This ground is merely a repetition of a similar ground argued before the Federal Magistrate.

In those paragraphs of its reasons, the Tribunal gave express consideration to the practicalities of the appellants relocating in light of the husband's personal situation and circumstances (including his previously demonstrated ability to relocate within India), as well as his financial resources, skills and knowledge.\\n\\nThe Federal Magistrate noted that the findings and reasons of the Tribunal did not manifest a misunderstanding or a misapplication of the relevant principles. In my judgment, the Federal Magistrate was correct when she expressed this conclusion, and there was no error in the approach of the Tribunal in dealing with relocation.\\n\\nGround 3 was also advanced before the Federal Magistrate. The Federal Magistrate noted that the Tribunal concluded that it could not be satisfied that there was a real chance of persecution of the husband in the foreseeable future by members of the BJP elsewhere in India. Her Honour said that it was open to the Tribunal to prefer the country information where the husband's evidence differed from it. At the beginning of its reasons for decision, the Tribunal set out the law relating to the real chance test which is related to the concept of a well-founded fear for a Convention reason. In my judgment, it correctly articulated the relevant principles.\\n\\nIn substance, the complaint under Ground 3 is a complaint that the Tribunal came to the wrong view on the facts. In my judgment, there is no error disclosed in the Tribunal's decision and, in particular, no error which could be characterised as jurisdictional error. Accordingly, Ground 3 has not been made out.\\n\\nFor these reasons, there has been no error on the part of the Federal Magistrate demonstrated by the appellants, nor have they been able to demonstrate jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal. Accordingly, I propose to dismiss the appeal with costs. \\n I certify that the preceding thirty-four (34) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Foster. \\n \\n Associate:\\n \\n \\nDated: 19 August 2009\\n \\n \\n The Appellants appeared in person \\n \\n Solicitor for the First Respondent: Mr J Pinder of DLA Phillips Fox \\n \\n Solicitor for the Second Respondent: The Second Respondent submitted save as to costs \\n Date of Hearing: 17 August 2009 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 17 August 2009 \\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2009\\/904.html\",\"4\":\"Further, in safely relocating, the applicant is not expected to modify his or her behaviour in order to avoid persecution ( SZATV [2007] HCA 40 ; 233 CLR 18 ; Randhawa v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs [1994] FCA 1253 ; (1994) 52 FCR 437).\"}}"
