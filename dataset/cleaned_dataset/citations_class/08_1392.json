Further, s 52(1) of the Act provides that, at the hearing of the creditor's petition, the Court shall require proof of the matters stated in the petition. Those matters include the debtor's indebtedness to the petitioning creditor. The Court can only make a sequestration order if it is satisfied that there is proof of those matters. If any genuine dispute exists as to the liability of the debtor to the petitioning creditor it ought to be investigated before he is made bankrupt: Ahern v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (Qld) [1987] FCA 312 ; (1987) 76 ALR 137 at 148.\",\"1\":\"40 Fifth, the alleged term is uncertain and almost certainly unenforceable. Liability had already been established in favour of the appellant and the other litigants by a judgment of the Supreme Court and only an assessment of damages remained: Camila Pty Ltd v Actus Australia Pty Ltd (1994) 16 ATPR 41-367. What did \\\"success\\\" mean in those circumstances? If such a term had been agreed I would have expected that the parties would have spelt out what was the minimum amount of damages such as to constitute a \\\"success\\\". Mr Kurland does not depose to having discussed or agreed what circumstances would constitute \\\"success\\\" in the context of the litigation. This is to be contrasted with his own success fee agreement to which I have referred. There Mr Kurland was to receive $50,000 plus 20% of all gross amounts (after first deducting the $50,000) paid by the respondent to the appellant and the other litigants as a result of the Supreme Court action.\\n\\n41 Sixth, Mr Kurland has a history of demonstrated dishonesty. Some six years before the events in question here, on 30 October 1989, acting pursuant to the Legal Practitioner Act 1898 (NSW), the Solicitors' Statutory Committee made an order that no solicitor should, in connection with his practice as a solicitor, take into or retain in his employment or remunerate Mr Kurland except in accordance with permission in writing granted by the Law Society of New South Wales for such a period and subject to such conditions as the Law Society might think fit to specify in the permission. The Committee had considered serious allegations made against Mr Kurland concerning his employment as a Clerk in the employment of two separate firms of solicitors. The allegations concerned Mr Kurland holding himself out as being a legally qualified practising solicitor when he was not, as well as misappropriating cheques, misappropriating trust funds and failing to account for deposit monies under a contract. The Committee found that the allegations had been established. The dishonesty variously described involved significant sums of money. In addition the Committee took into account the fact that Mr Kurland had been convicted at Hornsby Local Court in February 1987 with a criminal offence of obtaining financial advantage by deception. There is no corroboration of Mr Kurland's evidence as to the success fee. Indeed, Mr Kurland's evidence as to the $50,000 success fee allegedly made a few weeks after the 21 September 1995 meeting is contradicted by the fact that no amendment was made to the Retainer Agreement to include this term.\\n\\n42 Seventh, the defence filed by the appellant and Mr Paligorov in the District Court action denied that the respondent had been engaged to act for the appellant and the other litigants in the Supreme Court proceedings in writing and in particular denied that the respondent had been instructed pursuant to a Law Society costs agreement relating to hourly charges. This denial was contrary to the true position as the appellant must be taken to have known. Before the primary court, for the first time, the appellant said that the costs agreement was partly written and partly oral. It was admitted by the appellant that a Law Society of Western Australia's written Retainer Agreement was entered into on or about 1 October 1995 between himself and the other litigants, as clients, and the respondent as solicitors. The agreement provides for payment based on an hourly rate fee. It does not contain a \\\"no win no fee\\\" term or any term for a success fee of $50,000 or otherwise.\",\"2\":\"18 The appellant submits that the affidavit evidence was sufficient to establish a \\\"bona-fide allegation\\\" that no real debt lies behind the judgment: Corney v Brien [1951] HCA 31 ; (1951) 84 CLR 343 at 357-8. Putting it another way, he submits that substantial reasons had been demonstrated for questioning whether behind the Judgment there was in truth and reality a debt due to the respondent: Wren at p 224-5. He relied upon his own affidavits sworn on 22 and 24 May 2007 and that of Mr Richard Kurland sworn on 5 November 2007. Mr Kurland was engaged by the appellant and the other litigants to assist them in their Supreme Court action.\\n\\n22 It will often be necessary, in considering whether or not to exercise the discretion to go behind a judgment to conduct some preliminary investigation of the merits of the attack on the judgment: Corney v Brien at 358. The primary judge took that course. His Honour gave consideration to whether the allegation that the parties agreed on 21 September 1995, to an oral term for payment of a $50,000 success fee could succeed and whether it was, in effect, a bona fide allegation.\",\"3\":\"14 It is not necessary for a respondent debtor to prove that they are not, in truth and reality, indebted to the petitioning creditor. All that is required of a respondent debtor was to show that there was \\\"substantial reason for questioning whether there is ... a debt\\\": Joosse v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2004] FCAFC 245 ; (2004) 137 FCR 576 at 579 [6] per North and Finkelstein JJ.\\n\\n15 The primary judge declined to go behind the Judgment for reasons he expressed in the following way. \\n \\n \\n [17] Accepting that this Court can go behind a judgment, and that it can do so more easily where there is as here a default judgment, the matter is ultimately one for the exercise of the Court discretion. Given: \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n a) the history of the litigation and the delays which have occurred (none of which are the fault of the Applicant); and \\n \\n b) that the Respondent has now failed, resoundingly, twice in the District Court and twice in the Court of Appeal in attempts to allow it to effectively further pursue the matter with a view to undoing the order of Sleight DCJ giving rise to the Judgment Debt; \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n this Court does not consider it appropriate to go behind the Judgment Debt. There is a general principle of comity and recognition of other courts' judgments which also underlies this Court's view. \\n \\n \\n \\n [18] In any event, the Court does not consider the allegations of champerty and maintenance, or other illegality in the Terms, can succeed or are genuinely arguable. The Applicant was entitled to be paid for its services as a professional service firm, and the Respondent agreed to do so on the terms of a standard Law Society of Western Australia costs agreement. The express terms of that agreement preclude the implication of a term as to a success fee. Further, the evidence of the success fee agreement relied upon by the Respondent is, in any event, entirely hearsay and not admissible.\",\"4\":\"6 The Judgment was entered following the dismissal of an appeal by the appellant and Mr Paligorov against a springing order that had been made by a Deputy Registrar on 5 May 2005 following a series of defaults by the appellant and Mr Paligorov in providing proper discovery. As the springing order had not been complied with, judgment was entered for the respondent: Leonard Cohen & Co v Richardson [2005] WADC 172. The reasons of Sleight DCJ recounted that:\\n ...the history of this matter demonstrates that the defendants have deliberately attempted to frustrate the plaintiff's attempts to obtain proper discovery, and in doing so they have sought to avoid putting the plaintiffs in the position which they will be able to prepare adequately for trial.\",\"5\":\"48 The appellant submits that Mr Kurland's testimony is uncontradicted in that Mr Levitan did not provide an affidavit concerning this alleged telephone conversation. It is by no means clear that Mr Levitan is a witness who would ordinarily have been expected to be called by the respondent. Mr Levitan acted as the appellant's solicitor in the Supreme Court litigation after the respondent's retainer ended. He was, at least, equally available as a witness for both parties in this matter and possibly more available to the appellant given the past relationship of confidence between them as solicitor and client: Payne v Parker [1976] 1 NSWLR 191 at 201-202. More importantly the evidence of a $50,000 success fee term agreed to orally a few weeks after 21 September 1995 does not support the appellant's pleaded defence in the District Court action: a defence from which he did not resile in the court below.\\n\\n49 Finally, I consider that the primary judge was correct to take into account the history of the District Court action and the appeals by the appellant to the Court of Appeal of Western Australia, particularly the criticisms made by Sleight DCJ and Wheeler JA respectively. They are testimony to the improper conduct of the appellant in the litigation but for which the merits of the respondent's claim and more significantly the appellant's defence would long ago have been heard and determined. This conduct, in my opinion, is a relevant factor in the Court's overall consideration of the merits of the defence and whether the evidence of the appellant and Mr Kurland raise genuine issues and a reason therefore to go behind the Judgment. These considerations weigh in the balance against the appellant.\\n\\n50 For these reasons I would reject each of the three grounds of appeal. I am not satisfied that the appellant has demonstrated that the discretion of the primary judge miscarried. The appeal should be dismissed with costs. \\n \\n\\n I certify that the preceding fifty (50) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gilmour. \\n\\n Associate:\\n\\nDated: 12 September 2008\\n\\n Counsel for the Appellant: Mr C S Williams \\n \\n Solicitor for the Appellant: Solomon Brothers \\n \\n Counsel for the Respondent: Mr B W Ashdown \\n \\n Solicitor for the Respondent: Stewart Forbes, Barrister and Solicitor \\n\\n Date of Hearing: 28 August 2008 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 12 September 2008 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2008\\/1392.html\",\"6\":\"7 An appeal from the Judgment was dismissed by the Court of Appeal of Western Australia following further procedural defaults by the appellant and Mr Paligorov: Richardson v Leonard Cohen & Co (a firm) [2006] WASCA 64.

Such a judgment is prima facie evidence of the antecedent debt. The discretion is not well exercised where substantial reasons are given for questioning whether behind that judgment there was in truth and reality a debt due to the petitioner: Wren v Mahony [1972] HCA 5 ; (1971) 126 CLR 212 at 224-5 per Barwick CJ with whom Windeyer and Owen JJ agreed.\\n\\n18 The appellant submits that the affidavit evidence was sufficient to establish a \\\"bona-fide allegation\\\" that no real debt lies behind the judgment: Corney v Brien [1951] HCA 31 ; (1951) 84 CLR 343 at 357-8.

Mr Kurland was engaged by the appellant and the other litigants to assist them in their Supreme Court action.\",\"14\":\"13 The Court will not go behind a judgment as a matter of course, but where a judgment is obtained by default the Court in bankruptcy will more readily look behind the judgment than it would if the judgment were obtained following a hearing on the merits: Wolff v Donovan (1991) 29 FCR 480 at 486 per Lee and Hill JJ. At 487 their Honours said: \\n \\\"[T]he true position is that there is a shifting onus. Once the judgment is proved, and it is prima facie evidence of the existence of the underlying debt, there is a tactical onus on the debtor to show that there are circumstances which make it appropriate to go behind the debt to see whether the judgment was in truth and reality a true debt. The overall onus of proof of the existence of a real debt underlying a judgment, however, remains always with the petitioning creditor.\\\"\\n\\n23 There is no suggestion in the reasons of the primary judge, in the papers before me or the submissions of the parties, that the court below was asked to enter upon a two-staged process involving, first, the adjudication of a preliminary issue, whether reason was shown for questioning whether behind the Judgment there was really a debt, before proceeding at a later hearing to determine the issue of whether there was in truth a real debt: Wolff at p 486.\\n\\n24 Rather, the court below was invited to consider such evidence as was before it and to exercise its discretion one way or the other. If it exercised its discretion in favour of going behind the Judgment, it would then, on the same body of evidence, adjudicate the question whether a debt was truly owed. If it exercised the discretion against going behind the Judgment then a sequestration order would immediately follow.\\n\\n25 The affidavit evidence concerns what allegedly occurred at a meeting on 21 September 1995 at the respondent's offices and in a later alleged telephone conversation a few weeks after 21 September 1995. The defence in the District Court action did not plead or particularise that any term of the \\\"Terms of Engagement\\\" was made on any date other than 21 September 1995. The background to the meeting according to Mr Kurland was that he had come to Perth with the appellant in September 1995 to attempt to identify a law firm which would act for the appellant and the other litigants in the Supreme Court action on a \\\"no win-no fee\\\" basis. The respondent was identified by him as such a firm and he arranged a meeting for 21 September 1995 to discuss the matter of fees.\"}}"
