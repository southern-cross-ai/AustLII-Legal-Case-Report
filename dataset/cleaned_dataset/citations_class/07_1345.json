Racing and Wagering referred to the judgment of Mansfield J in Australian Consulting and Training Pty Ltd v Tiltform Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1072. His Honour was there considering amongst other things and relevantly for the purposes of the motion before me, the question of whether a pleading was capable of making out threats of infringement within the meaning of s 128(1) of the Patents Act 1990 (Cth) (' Patents Act ' ).\"}}"
