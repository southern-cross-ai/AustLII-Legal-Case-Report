I agree with counsel for Bayer that the decision of the High Court in Queensland v JL Holdings Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 1 ; (1997) 189 CLR 146 does not mean that parties have a right to withhold amendments or other procedural steps to suit their tactical assessments of the case. Even by the standards of patent litigation in this country, which sometimes are the subject of criticism, this case has been very drawn out. It has been on foot since 2003. Any insertion of a totally new claim or defence needs to have some sound basis, which in my opinion has not been shown in this case.\\n\\n7 The motion on notice dated 9 March 2007 will be dismissed with costs.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n I certify that the preceding seven (7) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Heerey. \\n\\n\\n Associate:\\n\\nDated: 21 March 2007\\n\\n\\n Counsel for the Applicant: A Ryan \\n \\n Solicitor for the Applicant: Davies Collison Cave \\n \\n Counsel for the Respondent: S Burley \\n \\n Solicitor for the Respondent: Mallesons Stephen Jaques \\n \\n Date of Hearing: 15 March 2007 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 15 March 2007 \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2007\\/411.html\"}}"
