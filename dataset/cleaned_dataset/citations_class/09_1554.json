That case concerned s 5(1)(b) of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1946 (NSW) which provided in part that: \\n \\n Where damage is suffered by any person as a result of a tort ... (b) if more than one action is brought in respect of that damage by or on behalf of the person by whom it was suffered ... against tortfeasors liable in respect of the damage (whether as joint tortfeasors or otherwise) the sums recoverable under the judgments given in those actions by way of damages shall not in the aggregate exceed the amount of the damages awarded by the judgment first given ... \\n \\n\\n \\nThe Court held that the provision applied only to cases where there was more than one proceeding, and thus did not preclude recovery against more than one defendant sued as joint tortfeasors in the one proceeding. Baxter [2001] HCA 66 ; 205 CLR 635 did not involve a limitation provision. I am unable to see how it assists the applicant.\\n\\nFor the above reasons I am of the view that the Magistrate's decision is not attended with sufficient doubt to warrant reconsideration by this Court.\\n\\nIf, contrary to my opinion, the Magistrate's order was a final order, I would dismiss the appeal for the same reasons I would refuse leave to appeal assuming the order to be interlocutory.\\n I certify that the preceding fourteen (14) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Sundberg. \\n \\n Associate:\\n \\n \\nDated: 22 December 2009\\n \\n The applicant appeared in person. \\n \\n Counsel for the Respondent: J Brereton \\n \\n Solicitor for the Respondent: Rebecca Goodger, Ford Motor Company of Australia \\n Date of Hearing: 10 December 2009 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 22 December 2009 \\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2009\\/1554.html\",\"1\":\"The applicant accepted that but for the provisions of Part VIA of the Act, his proceeding was out of time. He submits that that Part permits his otherwise out of time claim. Part VIA deals with Proportionate Liability for Misleading and Deceptive Conduct and was introduced into the Act in 2004. Its purpose was explained by Finkelstein J in BHPB Freight Pty Ltd v Cosco Oceania Chartering Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 1656 at [4] .\\n\\nPart VIA consists of ss 87CB to 87CI. Section 87CB(1) limits the operation of the Part to a claim for damages under s 82 for economic loss or damage to property caused by conduct in contravention of s 52. This type of claim is called an \\\"apportionable claim\\\". Section 87CD establishes proportionate liability for an apportionable claim. Subsection (1) provides: \\n \\n In any proceedings involving an apportionable claim: \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n (a) the liability of a defendant who is a concurrent wrongdoer in relation to that claim is limited to an amount reflecting that proportion of the damage or loss claimed that the court considers just having regard to the extent of the defendant's responsibility for the damage or loss; and\\n (b) the court may give judgment against the defendant for not more than that amount. \\n \\n\\n \\nThe expression \\\"concurrent wrongdoer\\\" is defined in 87CB(3) as a person who is one of two or more persons whose acts or omissions caused, independently of each other or jointly, the damage or loss that is the subject of the apportionable claim. Section 87CF provides that a defendant against whom judgment is given as a concurrent wrongdoer cannot be required to contribute to the damages recovered from another concurrent wrongdoer or indemnify any such wrongdoer. Section 87CG(1) provides:\\n \\n \\n In relation to an apportionable claim, nothing in this Part or any other law prevents a plaintiff who has previously recovered judgment against a concurrent wrongdoer for an apportionable part of any damage or loss from bringing another action against any other concurrent wrongdoer for that damage or loss.\\n\\nThe applicant claims to bring himself within s 87CG(1) by reason of a settlement of his claim against Stillwell in October 2003. This is the proceeding referred to in the first paragraph of the passage quoted at [2]. The settlement occurred as the result of a mediation. The County Court proceeding was struck out by consent with no order as to costs. Accordingly s 87CG(1) does not apply for want of \\\"judgment recovered\\\". However, quite apart from this, Part VIA does not seem to me to provide any assistance to the applicant in displacing the limitation period in s 82(2).\",\"2\":\"The applicant appeared in person. Although he made no express application for leave, I will treat him as seeking it. Leave to appeal is only granted if the applicant establishes that the decision at first instance is attended with sufficient doubt to warrant its reconsideration by an appellate court and substantial injustice would result if leave were refused, supposing the decision to be wrong: D&eacute;cor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc [1991] FCA 655 ; (1991) 33 FCR 397 at 398-400.\",\"3\":\"Section 17A of the Federal Magistrates Act is in the same terms as s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).

His Honour was of the view that this was the clearest of cases. The applicant had no reasonable prospect of succeeding. His claim was clearly out of time.\\n\\nThe applicant has appealed against the Magistrate's dismissal of his application. By motion notice of which was filed on 15 October 2009 the respondent seeks an order that the appeal be dismissed \\\"for failing to identify any legal, factual or discretionary error in the judgment under appeal\\\". It contends first that the Magistrate's decision was interlocutory and no leave to appeal has been sought. It then contends, as per the motion, that the applicant has identified no error in the decision.\"}}"
