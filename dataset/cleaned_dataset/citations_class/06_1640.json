Section 65 of the Migration Act does not require the decision-maker to reach a decision to refuse a visa only if a particular matter is established. As their Honours said, quoting from the decision of another full court:\\n \\n It [section 65] requires a refusal if the decision-maker is not affirmatively satisfied that the criteria for the visa in question have been satisfied.\\n\\n37 It is well established that the scheme contemplated by Part 7 of the Migration Act expressly contemplates that in particular circumstances an appellant will not attend a hearing, including cases involving no fault of the applicant. Notwithstanding that, the Tribunal is authorised to proceed to decide the review in the applicant's absence; see VSAF of 2003 at [12]. See also VNAA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 134 ; (2004) 136 FCR 407 at [16] . For these reasons the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\",\"4\":\"28 The third ground of appeal is that the Tribunal failed to consider his claims. This seems to me to be a new ground of appeal which was not a ground of review before the learned Federal Magistrate. In any event it cannot be accepted for the reasons I have already given in relation to the previous ground of appeal. Moreover, as a full court said in NAVX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 287 at [5] :\\n \\n In assessing the adequacy of these reasons, it must be kept in mind that the Tribunal had indicated to the appellant that it was unable to find in his favour on the basis of the material in its possession and invited him to attend to provide additional information. Clearly enough, the Tribunal was not obliged to accept at face value his short and very vague outline of his basis for fearing prosecution in China. Having found that the outline was not sufficient to satisfy it that the appellant had a well-founded fear of persecution, it could do little more than offer his an opportunity to elaborate. When he failed to accept that opportunity, the inevitable consequence was the rejection of his application.\\n\\n29 The final ground of appeal is that the Tribunal failed to carry out its statutory duty. This appears to be a claim that there was a breach of s 424A of the Migration Act . This ground is without foundation.\",\"5\":\"25 It may be that the appellant seeks to raise a submission that the Tribunal had a duty to conduct its own independent inquiries. However, as Wilcox J observed in Prasad v Minister for Immigration and Ethinic Affairs (1985) 6 FCR 155 at 169-170, the circumstances under which a decision will be invalid for failure to conduct its own separate inquiries are strictly limited. There is nothing to suggest that that ground was enlivened in the present case.\",\"6\":\"23 His Honour there observed that it would be \\\"rare and exceptional\\\" for actual bias to be demonstrated solely from the published reasons for decision.

The principles are stated at [36] to [38] of his Honour's judgment and need not be repeated.\",\"8\":\"30 In SZEFM v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 78 at [23] , Bennett J referred to a number of authorities which show that where a Tribunal was merely \\\"identifying deficiencies or inadequacies in the appellant's case\\\" it cannot be said that the Tribunal was relying on information communicated to or received by the Tribunal. Rather, it was setting out its thought processes. The same principle applies here.\\n\\n31 As her Honour Bennett J said, there was no information that the Tribunal was obliged to give to the appellant by reason of s 424A(1).
