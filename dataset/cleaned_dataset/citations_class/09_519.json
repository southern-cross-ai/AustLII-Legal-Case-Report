In Symbion the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia allowed an appeal from a Master's decision dismissing an application to set aside a statutory demand. The decision is distinguishable. Unlike the three New South Wales cases to which I have referred and the present case, Symbion involved far more than the construction of a simple provision. It involved heads of agreement which, at least according to one party's submission, were to be construed against the background of \\\"the commercial context including the later conduct of the parties and their agents\\\" (per Gray J at [10]). The Court referred to issues as to the admissibility of post-contract conduct of the parties and the question whether the heads of agreement represented a concluded contract at all.\\n\\nIn the circumstances of the present case, I should decide the question of construction.\\n\\nCounsel for Lodge submits, first, that by the time of the November 2008 tranche, ETC was no longer \\\"a new client introduced to [Lodge] by [Mr Pegum]\\\" and that the defendants were entitled to the Introduction Fee only on the first tranche because it was only in respect of that transaction that ETC could be described as \\\"a new client introduced to [Lodge] by [Mr Pegum]\\\". Secondly, he submits that the third sentence of the provision makes the payment of any introduction fee at all dependent on the matters mentioned in that sentence. Thirdly, he submits that the percentage payable is to be determined at Lodge's discretion and that Lodge should be taken to have exercised its discretion against paying any percentage in respect of the second tranche.\\n\\nCounsel for the defendants submits that once ETC was properly described in May 2008 as \\\"a new client introduced to [Lodge] by [Mr Pegum]\\\" it continued to satisfy that description, with the consequence that the defendants were entitled to the Introduction Fee on each transaction entered into by Lodge and ETC not just the first such transaction. Secondly, he submits that the amount of the Introduction Fee was a minimum of 10% and that the third sentence relates only to anything over and above the 10%. Thirdly, he submits that the same argument applies to the determination of the percentage at Lodge's discretion, also referred to in the third sentence.\\n\\nOn its face, the first sentence is ambiguous as the following considerations show.\",\"6\":\"The notion of not warranting further investigation has assumed importance in a particular class of case.

It has been included, admittedly tautologously, to emphasise that the client must not have been a client of Lodge prior to the introduction, not that the client must not have been a client of Lodge prior to the transaction in question.
