The Federal Magistrates Court dismissed the application: SZLQW v Minister for Immigration [2008] FMCA 782. The Appellant now appeals to this Court.\\n\\n3 Today, when the matter was called on for hearing, there was no attendance by the Appellant. The Appellant, however, had been advised of the date and time of the hearing of this appeal by way of a letter from the National Appeals Registrar of this Court dated 22 July 2008. On behalf of the First Respondent, an application was then made for the appeal to be dismissed pursuant to s 25(2B)(bb)(ii) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). Rather than dismissing the appeal, it was considered that the more prudent course was to proceed to hear the appeal in the absence of the Appellant. Such a course is permitted by O 52 r 38A(1)(d) of the Federal Court Rules . Rule 38A provides as follows:\\n Absence of party (1) If a party is absent when an appeal is called on for hearing, the Court may: (a) order that the hearing not proceed unless the appeal is again set down for hearing or such other steps are taken as the Court directs; or (b) adjourn the hearing; or (d) proceed with the hearing, either generally or in relation to any claim for relief in the appeal. (2) If the Court proceeds with the hearing under paragraph (1) (d), the Court may: (a) set aside or vary any order made after so proceeding; and (b) give directions for the further conduct of the appeal.\",\"15\":\"7 No jurisdiction is conferred upon this Court to conduct a review of the Tribunal's decision upon the basis invited by the Notice of Appeal .
