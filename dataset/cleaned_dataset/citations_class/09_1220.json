I gratefully adopt what his Honour there said (omitting the quite exhaustive case citation): \\n \\n The principles that are applicable in deciding whether an agreement that parties have entered is one that is wholly in writing, or partly written and partly oral, include the following: \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n (1) When there is a document that on its face appears to be a complete contract, that provides an evidentiary basis for inferring that the document contains the whole of the express contractual terms that bind the parties: \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n (2) It is open to a party to prove that, even though there is a document that on its face appears to be a complete contract, the parties have agreed orally on terms additional to those contained in the writing: \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n ... Conversely, it is open to a party to prove that the parties have orally agreed that a document should contain the whole of the terms agreed between them: \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n (3) The parol evidence rule applies only to contracts that are wholly in writing, and thus has no scope to operate until it has first been ascertained that the contract is wholly in writing: \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n (4) Where a contract is partly written and partly oral, the terms of the contract are to be ascertained from the whole of the circumstances as a matter of fact: \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n (5) In determining what are the terms of a contract that is partly written and partly oral, surrounding circumstances may be used as an aid to finding what the terms of the contract are: ... If it is possible to make a finding about what were the words the parties said to each other, the meaning of those words is ascertained in the light of the surrounding circumstances: ... If it is not possible to make a finding about the particular words that were used (as sometimes happens when a contract is partly written, partly oral and partly inferred from conduct) the surrounding circumstances can be looked at to find what in substance the parties agreed: \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n (6) A quite separate type of contractual arrangement to a contract that is partly written and partly oral is where there is a contract wholly in writing and an oral collateral contract. \\n \\n (ii) Interpretation\\n\\nFirst, it has for some time now been indicated \\\"with tolerable clarity\\\" ( Masterton Homes , at [1]) that, in interpreting a contract, one is entitled to consider context, background and surrounding circumstances without the need first to find some textual ambiguity: see Pacific Carriers Ltd v BNP Paribas [2004] HCA 35 ; (2004) 218 CLR 451 ; Toll (FGCT) Pty Ltd v Alphapharm Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 52 ; (2004) 219 CLR 165 at [40] ; Synergy Protection Agency Pty Ltd v North Sydney Leagues Club [2009] NSWCA 140 at [22] ; Lion Nathan Australia Pty Ltd v Coopers Brewery Ltd [2005] FCA 1812 ; (2005) 223 ALR 560 at 573-547; Douglas, \\\"Modern Approaches to the Construction and Interpretation of Contracts\\\" (2009) 32 Aust Bar Rev 158.\\n\\nFourthly, although the present state of the law in this country is not yet settled on whether it is possible to use post-contractual conduct as an aid to construction of a written contract, the more favoured view is that it is not: see Masterton Homes, at [114]; FAI Traders Insurance Co Pty Ltd v Savoy Plaza Pty Ltd [1993] 2 VR 343. The criticisms of this view are, in the main, directed at its inflexibility particularly in relational contract settings: see eg GEC Marconi Systems Pty Ltd v BHP Information Technology Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 50 ; (2003) 128 FCR 1 at [351] ; see also Unidroit Principles of International Commercial Contracts: 2004 , Art 4.3.\",\"1\":\"First, it has for some time now been indicated \\\"with tolerable clarity\\\" ( Masterton Homes , at [1]) that, in interpreting a contract, one is entitled to consider context, background and surrounding circumstances without the need first to find some textual ambiguity: see Pacific Carriers Ltd v BNP Paribas [2004] HCA 35 ; (2004) 218 CLR 451 ; Toll (FGCT) Pty Ltd v Alphapharm Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 52 ; (2004) 219 CLR 165 at [40] ; Synergy Protection Agency Pty Ltd v North Sydney Leagues Club [2009] NSWCA 140 at [22] ; Lion Nathan Australia Pty Ltd v Coopers Brewery Ltd [2005] FCA 1812 ; (2005) 223 ALR 560 at 573-547; Douglas, \\\"Modern Approaches to the Construction and Interpretation of Contracts\\\" (2009) 32 Aust Bar Rev 158.\\n\\nSecondly, the rights and liabilities of the parties to a contract are determined by the \\\"principle of objectivity\\\": Pacific Carriers Ltd , at [22].

As Gibbs CJ said of a best efforts obligation in Hospital Products Ltd (at 64): \\n \\n ... it is trite to say that the meaning of particular words in a contract must be determined in the light of the context provided by the contract as a whole and the circumstances in which it was made, and that decisions on the effect of the same words in a different context must be viewed with caution. \\n \\n\\n \\nToday this probably does no more than emphasise the contemporary significance of context in contractual interpretation: see Toll (FGCT) Pty Ltd at [40]; and, relevantly for present purposes, that a commercial contract is to be given \\\"a businesslike interpretation\\\": International Air Transport Association at [8]; or as Lord Steyn put it ( Mannai Investment Co Ltd at 771): \\\"a commercially sensible construction\\\". \\n Factual Setting\",\"3\":\"First, it has for some time now been indicated \\\"with tolerable clarity\\\" ( Masterton Homes , at [1]) that, in interpreting a contract, one is entitled to consider context, background and surrounding circumstances without the need first to find some textual ambiguity: see Pacific Carriers Ltd v BNP Paribas [2004] HCA 35 ; (2004) 218 CLR 451 ; Toll (FGCT) Pty Ltd v Alphapharm Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 52 ; (2004) 219 CLR 165 at [40] ; Synergy Protection Agency Pty Ltd v North Sydney Leagues Club [2009] NSWCA 140 at [22] ; Lion Nathan Australia Pty Ltd v Coopers Brewery Ltd [2005] FCA 1812 ; (2005) 223 ALR 560 at 573-547; Douglas, \\\"Modern Approaches to the Construction and Interpretation of Contracts\\\" (2009) 32 Aust Bar Rev 158.\",\"4\":\"First, it has for some time now been indicated \\\"with tolerable clarity\\\" ( Masterton Homes , at [1]) that, in interpreting a contract, one is entitled to consider context, background and surrounding circumstances without the need first to find some textual ambiguity: see Pacific Carriers Ltd v BNP Paribas [2004] HCA 35 ; (2004) 218 CLR 451 ; Toll (FGCT) Pty Ltd v Alphapharm Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 52 ; (2004) 219 CLR 165 at [40] ; Synergy Protection Agency Pty Ltd v North Sydney Leagues Club [2009] NSWCA 140 at [22] ; Lion Nathan Australia Pty Ltd v Coopers Brewery Ltd [2005] FCA 1812 ; (2005) 223 ALR 560 at 573-547; Douglas, \\\"Modern Approaches to the Construction and Interpretation of Contracts\\\" (2009) 32 Aust Bar Rev 158.\",\"5\":\"Thirdly, if a written agreement has a history, \\\"that history is part of the context in which the contract has its meaning\\\": International Air Transport Association v Ansett Australia Holdings Ltd [2008] HCA 3 ; (2008) 234 CLR 151 at [8] .

Neither has there been any attempt to rely upon subsequent conduct for the purpose of interpreting the Distribution Agreement: see Cheshire and Fifoot's Law of Contract , [10.16] (9 th Aust ed). Distinctly, there is no allegation made that in exercising its cl 41.1.6 power Hamilton breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing to AMC or otherwise acted unconscionably: cf 67 Am Jur 2d, \\\"Sales\\\", \\u00a7343. (a) AMC's contentions\\n\\nAs AMC's submissions as to the inefficacy of the 13 July 2006 notice of termination turns, in the first instance, upon the construction it advances of cl 8.1, it is appropriate to deal with that provision first.\\n\\nThe AMC case can be put shortly. It is that cl 8.1 provides the mechanism for setting the \\\"Term\\\" (ie the duration) of the Distribution Agreement. Unless and until either (or both) of the parties gave \\\"the written notice of its desire to terminate\\\" the Agreement, or \\\"to alter its terms and conditions\\\" (such notice to be given 4 years before the expiration of the 5 year term) \\\"the Term in this Agreement was automatically extended for 12 months to make up the Term to 5 years\\\". In other words, subject to the non-occurrence at the end of the first year of the term of the stipulated condition (which, if it had occurred, would have limited the term of the agreement to a further 4 years (the remaining of the initial term), the initial term was automatically extended a further year. In this sense, it allowed for a rolling 5 year term. Further, it provided expressly for four years notification of a party's \\\"desire to terminate\\\" the Agreement. It could not otherwise be terminated (save by later express agreement). Importantly, it could not be terminated under cl 41.1.6.\\n\\nI have earlier indicated that AMC has not pleaded that the Distribution Agreement was amended after its execution so as to vary cl 8.2. I need not enter upon the matter of variation or of the possible significance of the agreement apparently made at the 23 March 2005 meeting to continue automatically to extend the Distribution Agreement each year for a further 12 months \\\"thereby ensuring a rolling 5 year term at all times\\\". However I would make the following observations. Neither the entire agreement clause (cl 45) nor the writing requirement of cl 50.2 provided an impediment to an oral variation of the Distribution Agreement if such an agreement was in fact reached. I considered the efficacy of \\\"no oral modification\\\" clauses at length in GEC Marconi Systems Pty Ltd , at [214]-[222]. The rule to be applied to such clauses reflects the observation made by Cardozo J in Beatty v Guggenheim Exploration Co 122 NE 378 (1919): \\\"Whenever two men contract, no limitation self imposed can destroy their power to contract again\\\". I would add, as I said in GEC Marconi (at [220]): \\n \\n (5) The usual objection raised to depriving a no oral modification clause of legal effect is that it involves a failure to give effect to what the parties have agreed. In the present case GEC Marconi has raised just this objection. The vice in it, though, is that a later oral or implied contract is itself an agreement. As a US commentator recently observed (Snyder, \\\"The Law of Contract and the Concept of Change: Public and Private Attempts to Regulate Modification, Waiver and Estoppel\\\" (1999) Wis L Rev 607 at p 640): \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n The question for the court is not whether to honour the parties' original agreement, but rather which of their agreements should be effective. To say that contract law should enforce the parties' agreement, therefore, does not resolve the issue. The question is whether to enforce the first agreement or the second. \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n The common-law courts addressing [no oral modification] issues chose the second. This choice makes a fair amount of sense; the later agreement probably reflects what the parties want better than their earlier agreement does. \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n I would add that the opinion expressed in the second quoted paragraph is particularly appropriate to relational contracts which, as in the present instance, may be evolutionary in character.\",\"10\":\"Fifthly, a commercial contract is to be given \\\"a businesslike interpretation\\\": International Air Transport Association v Ansett Australia Holdings Ltd at [8]; or as Lord Steyn put it ( Mannai Investment Co Ltd v Eagle Star Life Assurance Co Ltd [1997] UKHL 19 ; [1997] AC 749 at 771); \\\"a commercially sensible construction\\\".\\n\\nThe \\\"standard of endeavour\\\" prescribed by a best efforts clause is characteristically measured by what is reasonable in the circumstances having regard to the particular contract in its business setting and to what could reasonably be expected of the party subject to the obligation: see Transfield Pty Ltd v Arlo Internation Ltd [1980] HCA 15 ; (1980) 144 CLR 83 at 101; see also Farnsworth, Contracts , \\u00a77.17. Or to put it shortly, the party's obligation is \\\"to do what [it] reasonably could do in the circumstances\\\": Terrel , at 237. It is nonetheless important in this setting to emphasise the importance of context in giving practical substance to the prescribed standard of endeavour. As Gibbs CJ said of a best efforts obligation in Hospital Products Ltd (at 64): \\n \\n ... it is trite to say that the meaning of particular words in a contract must be determined in the light of the context provided by the contract as a whole and the circumstances in which it was made, and that decisions on the effect of the same words in a different context must be viewed with caution. \\n \\n\\n \\nToday this probably does no more than emphasise the contemporary significance of context in contractual interpretation: see Toll (FGCT) Pty Ltd at [40]; and, relevantly for present purposes, that a commercial contract is to be given \\\"a businesslike interpretation\\\": International Air Transport Association at [8]; or as Lord Steyn put it ( Mannai Investment Co Ltd at 771): \\\"a commercially sensible construction\\\". \\n Factual Setting\",\"11\":\"I am mindful in this regard of what Hoffman LJ said in William Sindall Plc v Cambridgeshire County Council [1993] EWCA Civ 14 ; [1994] 3 All E R 932 at 940: \\n \\n It is, of course, a principle of construction that words capable of bearing a very wide meaning may have to be given a narrower construction to reconcile them with other parts of the document. This rule is particularly apposite if the effect of general words would otherwise be to nullify what the parties appear to have contemplated as an important element in the transaction. \\n \\n\\n \\nIt is evident that the parties clearly did contemplate that, in appropriate circumstances, the licence should be brought to an end, and that cl 41.1.6 provided an \\\"important element\\\" in that scheme. I need not repeat here what I earlier said of the significance of a power to terminate on notice in long term, relational contracts.\\n\\nThe submission that cl 8.1 was intended to guarantee a four year notice period before the agreement could be terminated cannot withstand scrutiny. The Agreement provided that AMC had minimum purchase obligations: see cl 10.2; and that if the Term was extended under cl 8.1, the parties would agree \\\"Minimum Purchases for the period of the extension and these [would] be appended to Schedule 4\\\". Clause 10.4 of the Agreement provided that, if AMC did not purchase products as specified in that Schedule, Hamilton could end the Licence \\\"entirely\\\" by written notice to AMC. There was no guarantee of 4 years notice here.\\n\\nClause 8.1 was not directed to how the Distribution Agreement could be terminated. Its concern was with its Term with whether the agreed 5 year term would be frozen or extended. Considered in light of cl 10.4, cl 10.5 and cl 41.1 but particularly cl 41.1.6, the language of notification of desire to terminate the agreement was intended to do no more than to indicate that the party was no longer prepared to extend the Term but rather, wanted the Agreement to terminate at the end of the then 5 year period specified in Schedule 4. This is how a reasonable commercial party would have understood it in its context.\",\"12\":\"I do not consider that it was. Though it appeared in clause 8 and by so doing emphasised that the minimum purchases regime would run in tandem with extensions granted under the rolling 5 year term, cl 8.1's function lay in its relationship with cl 10. That dealt with making best efforts to meet the requirements of Sched 4, and the consequences of failure to make the purchases specified in that schedule. It was a contingent condition to the performance and enforcement of the rights and obligations created under cl 10.2, cl 10.4 and cl 10.5. The non-fulfilment of the condition excused AMC further performance of its contractual obligations under cl 10.2 and cl 10.4 for the year of the extension: cf Maynard v Goode [1926] HCA 4 ; (1926) 37 CLR 529 at 540; University of Western Australia v Gray [2009] FCAFC 116 at [117] ; Cheshire and Fifoot's Law of Contract , [20.1]-[20.2] (9 th Aust ed). The failure to agree as required by cl 8.2 would not of itself constitute a breach of contract by either party, although one can envisage circumstances in which one party so conducts itself in relation to the entry into a cl 8.2 agreement as to be in breach of the Agreement or of an implied term necessary to give cl 8.2 business efficacy (eg to enter into \\\"genuine and good faith negotiations for such an agreement\\\": cf United Group Rail Services Ltd v Rail Corporation New South Wales [2009] NSWCA 177.

I need not consider either of these responses: on election see generally Agricultural and Rural Finance Pty Ltd v Gardiner [2008] HCA 57 ; (2008) 251 ALR 322 at [56] - [67] ; other than to say that the doctrine of election between inconsistent rights seems inapt to circumstances where cl 8, on the assumption being made, is self executing in its consequence. A claim based on estoppel, on the other hand, if it is not simply oral variation in disguise, has real prospects. The circumstances do demonstrate that from 1 July 2000 the parties conducted themselves in a way not envisaged by cl 8.2; that the contractual effect of their so doing was realised on 1 July 2004; but notwithstanding there were no longer agreed minimum purchases, the parties treated the Agreement as remaining on foot with its rolling 5 year term.\\n\\nEven if I am wrong both in the view I have taken both about the consequence of non-compliance with cl 8.2 and about estoppel, my ultimate conclusion would still stand. If the Term expired on 30 June 2004, the parties then continued in a relationship that clearly was contractual in character. No term having been agreed at that time (though this may have been varied by the 23 March 2005 agreement) the licence was terminable on the giving of reasonable notice (which I find 60 days to be in the circumstances), if it was not in fact ended under cl 41.1.6 (on the assumption that the provisions of the old Distribution Agreement were understood to remain applicable to the parties' business relationship insofar as they could continue to apply to it). Conclusion\\n\\nI find, in the circumstances, that the 1999 Distribution Agreement was terminated under cl 41.1.6 on the expiration of 60 days written notice which notice was given to AMC on 13 July 2006.\",\"17\":\"Three aspects of cl 6.2 should be emphasised at the outset. The first is that cl 6.2 imposed reciprocal and, at least in the case of parallel importation, potentially interdependent obligations on AMC and Hamilton. Those obligations could operate upon the same subject matter for the reason that each could relate, as in the present case, to genuine Hamilton products finding their way into the Hong Kong market outside of the Distribution Agreement. Further, when considered together with cl 34, one party's best efforts obligation could require it to do everything reasonable to help the other carry out its best efforts obligation. Secondly , the subclause did not impose a duty on either party to achieve a specific result, rather it was to use best efforts to secure that result: on the difference see Unidroit Principles of International Commercial Contracts : 2004, Art 5.1.4, Comment 1. The content of \\\"best efforts\\\" is considered below. Thirdly , the best efforts obligation was directed at preventing the occurrence of an undesired event, ie the sale \\\"in the Territory\\\" by third parties of products the subject of the Distribution Agreement. In this it was a less common form of the obligation, the more usual form being directed at procuring the occurrence of a desired result, eg the sale or promotion of a product: Hospital Products Ltd v United States Surgical Corporation [1984] HCA 64 ; (1984) 156 CLR 41 at 63-64; the exploitation of an invention: Terrell v Mabie Todd & Co Ltd (1952) 69 RPC 234 ; or the advancement of a business: Sheffield District Railway Co v Great Central Railway Co (1911) 27 TLR 451 at 452.\\n\\nThe \\\"standard of endeavour\\\" prescribed by a best efforts clause is characteristically measured by what is reasonable in the circumstances having regard to the particular contract in its business setting and to what could reasonably be expected of the party subject to the obligation: see Transfield Pty Ltd v Arlo Internation Ltd [1980] HCA 15 ; (1980) 144 CLR 83 at 101; see also Farnsworth, Contracts , \\u00a77.17.

Did it do all it reasonably could do in the circumstances to achieve the contractual object of cl 6.1: Hospital Products , at 64? I think not. Hamilton was supplying to Crafers identically, and very distinctively, presented Products to those supplied to AMC. The best efforts clause did not as of course require it to abstain from so doing. What it did require, though, was that Hamilton do all that it reasonably could to prevent the Product sold to Crafers being resold by a third party in AMC's Territory.\\n\\nMr Stafford sought contractually to regulate where the Product was to be resold. However, unlike in Hamilton's international distributorship agreements, Mr Stafford did not seek contractually to regulate to whom the Products could be sold. For him to rely upon what Crafers (via Mr Lanham) indicated was the purpose of their acquisition was clearly insufficient in the circumstances. Hamilton had had no prior dealings with Crafers. Theirs was not a relationship of trust. Crafers, on the material before me, did not indicate how it would effectuate its purpose. It could, for example, have sold the Product to an exporter. Further there is not, in the circumstances, any proper basis for concluding that Crafers had contractually bound itself to effectuate its purpose.\\n\\nGiven that the Products sold to Crafers were intended for use out of Australia (even if resold in Australia), it could reasonably be expected of Hamilton that it stipulate by type the person or classes of person (consistent with the understood purpose of the purchase) to whom the Products could be resold and this with the object of preventing the Products from finding their way into the export trade. If they did, given their Hong Kong packaging, there would be a likelihood of their finding their way into AMC's territory as parallel imports. And that is what occurred.\\n\\nBy way of preface I should note that up until final written submissions the case had been prosecuted by Hamilton on the basis that AMC, as Hamilton's fiduciary, held the two trademarks as constructive trustee for it, the marks having been obtained by it in breach of its fiduciary duty to Hamilton. The constructive trust claim and with it, seemingly, the allegation of breach of fiduciary duty were abandoned in Hamilton's written submissions. I say \\\"seemingly\\\" in relation to the fiduciary claim because it was scarcely addressed in submissions yet it is anything but non-contentious in the propositions it asserts: see Hospital Products Ltd ; Rickel v Schwinn Bicycle Co 192 Cal Reptr 732 (1983); Glover, Commercial Equity: Fiduciary Relationships , 3.48-3.51 (1995); and for the causes of contention in this area of the law see my \\\"Fiduciary Principle\\\" in Youdan (ed), Equity, Fiduciaries and Trusts , 1 (1989); see also Gibson Motorsport Merchandise Pty Ltd v Forbes [2006] FCAFC 44 ; (2006) 149 FCR 569 at [11] - [16] . I will return to this in the context of AMC's copyright ownership claim.\\n\\nIt was open to Hamilton and AMC to cast their contractual relationship in a way which could, for certain purposes at least, have obliged AMC to act in Hamilton's interests alone or, distinctly, in their joint interests: cf Gibson Motorsport Merchandise at [7]-[16]. They chose to formalise their relationship as one of supplier and distributor, a type of relationship which characteristically is designed, subject to contractual limitations, to serve the several interests of the participants: see Hospital Products Ltd v United States Surgical Corporation ; Rickel v Schwinn Bicycle Co . The Distribution Agreement, and the parties conduct under in it in relation to the packaging was quite characteristic of this. Dr Keung was permitted to serve AMC's interests in selling products it acquired from Hamilton, by utilising artwork and language which he considered would facilitate the sale of those products in the area of the Agreement, so furthering AMC's own interests. Hamilton, in turn, would thereby have its own interests served to the extent that enhanced sales by AMC would be likely to lead to enhanced orders from Hamilton. While AMC was given latitude in the language so used, Hamilton in turn was able to protect its own interests in this matter. It retained for itself a right to approve all statements made on the packaging because of its exposure to product liability and it insisted that the two language versions had to match (to comply with requirements of the TGA scheme). There was nothing fiduciary in this arrangement though it doubtless required elements of trust, cooperation and reliance by the parties if it was to work effectively. But these element of themselves did not turn a non-fiduciary contractual relationship into a fiduciary and personal one outside of, and potentially inconsistent with, the contract itself: cf Gibson Motorsport Merchandise at [11].\\n\\nThe accepted basis in this country of the equitable jurisdiction to relieve against an actual or threatened abuse of confidential information lies \\n \\n ... in the notion of an obligation of conscience arising from the circumstances in or through which the information was communicated or obtained. \\n \\n\\n \\n Moorgate Tobacco Co Ltd v Phillip Morris Ltd [No 2] [1984] HCA 73 ; (1984) 156 CLR 414 at 438.\",\"18\":\"Three aspects of cl 6.2 should be emphasised at the outset.

Secondly , the subclause did not impose a duty on either party to achieve a specific result, rather it was to use best efforts to secure that result: on the difference see Unidroit Principles of International Commercial Contracts : 2004, Art 5.1.4, Comment 1. The content of \\\"best efforts\\\" is considered below. Thirdly , the best efforts obligation was directed at preventing the occurrence of an undesired event, ie the sale \\\"in the Territory\\\" by third parties of products the subject of the Distribution Agreement. In this it was a less common form of the obligation, the more usual form being directed at procuring the occurrence of a desired result, eg the sale or promotion of a product: Hospital Products Ltd v United States Surgical Corporation [1984] HCA 64 ; (1984) 156 CLR 41 at 63-64; the exploitation of an invention: Terrell v Mabie Todd & Co Ltd (1952) 69 RPC 234 ; or the advancement of a business: Sheffield District Railway Co v Great Central Railway Co (1911) 27 TLR 451 at 452.\",\"20\":\"The \\\"standard of endeavour\\\" prescribed by a best efforts clause is characteristically measured by what is reasonable in the circumstances having regard to the particular contract in its business setting and to what could reasonably be expected of the party subject to the obligation: see Transfield Pty Ltd v Arlo Internation Ltd [1980] HCA 15 ; (1980) 144 CLR 83 at 101; see also Farnsworth, Contracts , \\u00a77.17. Or to put it shortly, the party's obligation is \\\"to do what [it] reasonably could do in the circumstances\\\": Terrel , at 237. It is nonetheless important in this setting to emphasise the importance of context in giving practical substance to the prescribed standard of endeavour. As Gibbs CJ said of a best efforts obligation in Hospital Products Ltd (at 64): \\n \\n ... it is trite to say that the meaning of particular words in a contract must be determined in the light of the context provided by the contract as a whole and the circumstances in which it was made, and that decisions on the effect of the same words in a different context must be viewed with caution. \\n \\n\\n \\nToday this probably does no more than emphasise the contemporary significance of context in contractual interpretation: see Toll (FGCT) Pty Ltd at [40]; and, relevantly for present purposes, that a commercial contract is to be given \\\"a businesslike interpretation\\\": International Air Transport Association at [8]; or as Lord Steyn put it ( Mannai Investment Co Ltd at 771): \\\"a commercially sensible construction\\\". \\n Factual Setting\",\"21\":\"The second of AMC's propositions in support of its case seeks to fix Hamilton with liability for breach of cl 6.2 on the basis that, because of what Hamilton is alleged to have known, it ought to have been aware that the Products were destined for AMC's Territory yet it failed to do what it reasonably could in the circumstances to have prevented this. It is this version of the case as put in submissions to which Hamilton takes objection. I have considerable difficulties with how AMC ascribes knowledge to Hamilton as such and with how it purports to aggregate that knowledge: cf Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Radio Rentals [2005] FCA 1133 ; (2005) 146 FCR 292 at [177] - [183] . The information to which it refers and which I earlier listed was not, at all relevant times, shown to have been possessed by any one corporate officer. Nor was it all relevantly possessed at the times the initial supplies were made. Mr Blake, for example, only became aware of the sales to Crafers in March 2002, some months after the first sales. Some, but not all of the listed matters may have been known to Mr Stafford. The basis upon which information (held by various corporate officers over time) was to be aggregated to produce the information base for the allegation that Hamilton ought to have been aware that the products were destined for Hong Kong has not been addressed: cf Radio Rentals . Nor is it said at what time Hamilton had that information base. Some of it, for example, was only acquired after the last supply had been made: eg (8) above. I agree with Hamilton's submission that some number of the pieces of knowledge propounded are, as put, unsupported by the evidence or, in my view, are misleading: eg paras (5), (6) and (8).\\n\\nThe evidence falls far short of establishing that Hamilton actually knew that the product sold to Crafers was destined for Hong Kong. It equally does not establish that the relevant proper officers of Hamilton were at any time recklessly indifferent to how Crafers dealt with the Product. Nor did it demonstrate Nelsonian blindness to the Product's likely destination. For reasons I give below, it may properly be said that the circumstances known to Mr Stafford may have called for greater vigilance than was demonstrated. What I do not understand, though, is why a concept akin to constructive notice for such is what seems to be being advanced should in the manner proposed be sufficient to provide the knowledge platform to establish liability in the way sought. This is not to say that the knowledge actually possessed by a person subject to a best efforts clause may not be such as to require further inquiry to be made if the person is to do all that he or she reasonably can in the circumstances to secure the covenanted result.\\n\\nI should note in passing that a consequence of the view I have expressed on Hamilton's state of knowledge necessitates the conclusion that it was not guilty of selling its Products into Hong Kong \\\"directly or indirectly\\\" in breach of cl 9.1.\",\"22\":\"First, AMC was in breach of its obligation under cl 6.2. This disentitled it from recovering damages from Hamilton for breach of cl 6.2. The reason for this, it is said, is that being ready, willing and able to perform at the appropriate time is a condition precedent to a cause of action in contract, whether for damages or otherwise. Reliance in this is placed upon Cohen & Co v Ockerby & Co Ltd [1917] HCA 58 ; (1917) 24 CLR 288 esp at 298 and upon some number of well known specific performance decisions.\\n\\nSecondly, by its failure to inform Hamilton of its knowledge, AMC caused the sales that occurred after \\\"31 January 2002\\\" (sic).\\n\\nThirdly, \\\"the applicant is not able to take advantage of its own wrong\\\". As I understand this in light of Hamilton's pleading and submissions, this defence, in essence, is one of failure to mitigate.\\n\\nNone of these defences were enlarged upon significantly in submissions. In light of my findings as to when AMC became aware of the reality of parallel importation but then failed, unreasonably to notify Hamilton thereof (ie in December 2001), its breach of cl 6.2 post-dated that of Hamilton's first sale to Crafers (which was on 12 or 13 November 2001). There is nothing to suggest that, as at the time of Hamilton's breach of cl 6.2, AMC was not ready, willing and able to perform its reciprocal obligation assuming it was relevantly a \\\"concurrent obligation\\\": cf Cohen & Co at 298. As put in its submissions, Hamilton's first defence is that, contrary to my findings, AMC became aware of the parallel importation and failed to notify this, in October 2001, ie prior to Hamilton's breach. It is unnecessary for me to consider the defence further although I would add that I express no view on the question whether it is an available defence for breaches of a provision such as is presently in question.\",\"23\":\"The second and third defences, in substance, raise issues of causation and of mitigation.

As noted in Furmston (ed) at 8.100-8.101, many of the reported cases which have considered whether the claimant has acted reasonably to reduce its loss have involved the refusal of offers made by the party in breach.

Hamilton, though, did not go on to show that, having the knowledge it did, AMC otherwise failed to use its best efforts as required by cl 6.2. Of this latter matter all I will say is this. AMC devised a strategy in October 2001 to use leaflets in, and holographic labels on, Urederm boxes to differentiate its product from parallel imported product. Notwithstanding the knowledge it acquired in December, it did not implement the leaflet strategy until April 2002, and the holographic strategy until September 2002. Equally, when Dr Keung conducted his market investigations in August 2002, parallel importation was quickly detected leading to proceedings against Forward Co in October 2002.\\n\\nBefore turning to the question of AMC's entitlement to recover damages for loss resulting from Hamilton's breaches prior to the end of December 2001, there is one further matter raised by Hamilton's to which I should refer. It is alleged that AMC had ulterior purposes, and acted in bad faith from August 2002 in asserting Hamilton was involved in the parallel importation. While I accept that Dr Keung knowingly made unsubstantiated and occasionally knowingly false assertions and representations which do him little credit, I do not accept that such subsequent conduct and the climate in which it occurred, have any real bearing on the questions I have to determine in light of my findings. Damages for breach of cl 6.2\",\"27\":\"The starting point in considering whether, and if so in what amount AMC, is entitled to damages for the claimed lost opportunity is, as it was put in Sellars v Adelaide Petroleum NL [1994] HCA 4 ; (1994) 179 CLR 332 (at 355): \\n \\n ... the general standard of proof in civil actions will ordinarily govern the issue of causation and the issue whether the applicant has sustained loss or damage. Hence the applicant must prove on the balance of probabilities that he or she has sustained some loss or damage. However, in a case such as the present, the applicant shows some loss or damage was sustained by demonstrating that the contravening conduct caused the loss of a commercial opportunity which had some value (not being a negligible value), the value being ascertained by reference to the degree of probabilities or possibilities. It is no answer to that way of viewing an applicant's case to say that the commercial opportunity was valueless on the balance of probabilities because to say that is to value the commercial opportunity by reference to a standard of proof which is inapplicable.\",\"28\":\"Neither AMC nor Hamilton have sought to differentiate the questions (a) whether AMC could and would have purchased and resold the U50g tubes sold to Crafers at or around the time the sales were made to Crafers?

I say \\\"seemingly\\\" in relation to the fiduciary claim because it was scarcely addressed in submissions yet it is anything but non-contentious in the propositions it asserts: see Hospital Products Ltd ; Rickel v Schwinn Bicycle Co 192 Cal Reptr 732 (1983); Glover, Commercial Equity: Fiduciary Relationships , 3.48-3.51 (1995); and for the causes of contention in this area of the law see my \\\"Fiduciary Principle\\\" in Youdan (ed), Equity, Fiduciaries and Trusts , 1 (1989); see also Gibson Motorsport Merchandise Pty Ltd v Forbes [2006] FCAFC 44 ; (2006) 149 FCR 569 at [11] - [16] . I will return to this in the context of AMC's copyright ownership claim.\\n\\nIt was open to Hamilton and AMC to cast their contractual relationship in a way which could, for certain purposes at least, have obliged AMC to act in Hamilton's interests alone or, distinctly, in their joint interests: cf Gibson Motorsport Merchandise at [7]-[16]. They chose to formalise their relationship as one of supplier and distributor, a type of relationship which characteristically is designed, subject to contractual limitations, to serve the several interests of the participants: see Hospital Products Ltd v United States Surgical Corporation ; Rickel v Schwinn Bicycle Co . The Distribution Agreement, and the parties conduct under in it in relation to the packaging was quite characteristic of this. Dr Keung was permitted to serve AMC's interests in selling products it acquired from Hamilton, by utilising artwork and language which he considered would facilitate the sale of those products in the area of the Agreement, so furthering AMC's own interests. Hamilton, in turn, would thereby have its own interests served to the extent that enhanced sales by AMC would be likely to lead to enhanced orders from Hamilton. While AMC was given latitude in the language so used, Hamilton in turn was able to protect its own interests in this matter. It retained for itself a right to approve all statements made on the packaging because of its exposure to product liability and it insisted that the two language versions had to match (to comply with requirements of the TGA scheme). There was nothing fiduciary in this arrangement though it doubtless required elements of trust, cooperation and reliance by the parties if it was to work effectively. But these element of themselves did not turn a non-fiduciary contractual relationship into a fiduciary and personal one outside of, and potentially inconsistent with, the contract itself: cf Gibson Motorsport Merchandise at [11].\",\"35\":\"By way of preface I should note that up until final written submissions the case had been prosecuted by Hamilton on the basis that AMC, as Hamilton's fiduciary, held the two trademarks as constructive trustee for it, the marks having been obtained by it in breach of its fiduciary duty to Hamilton.

I will return to this in the context of AMC's copyright ownership claim.\\n\\nThe second possibility that copyright is jointly owned by Hamilton and Dr Keung: FAD para 32.3 seems to suggest, implausibly, that the works either are \\\"works of joint authorship\\\" which s 10(1) defines to mean \\n \\n ... a work that has been produced by the collaboration of two or more authors and in which the contribution of each author is not separate from the contribution of the other author or the contributions of the other authors. \\n \\n\\n \\nor that, in some unexplained fashion, Keung had bound himself in preparing the artwork and product indications, to act in the joint interest of himself and Hamilton. Again I emphasise that the case has not been pleaded by any party on the basis that there was a joint venture in which, for some purposes at least, they agreed to advance their mutual as distinct from their several interests: cf Gibson Motorsport Merchandise at [11]-[16].\\n\\nThe third possibility ie Dr Keung is the owner: FAD para 32.4 is considered below: see \\\"Consideration\\\".\\n\\nHamilton has pleaded that AMC was in a fiduciary relationship with Hamilton in virtue (a) of Dr Keung's authorisation to translate literally, his alleged representations and non-disclosures relating to the Chinese marks and literal translations and (b) of the trust and reliance placed on AMC by Hamilton and of its corresponding position of vulnerability: FAD para 17.5. Hamilton has gone on to plead that if intellectual property was created in the \\\"Chinese Language Artwork\\\" , AMC holds that on constructive trust for Hamilton: FAD para 28.4. I would emphasise that this claim is limited to the Chinese Language Artwork and does not extend to the English language product indications. A like claim to the trademarks was abandoned prior to final submissions. The written submissions on the above fiduciary relationship and consequential constructive trust claim are slight to the point of being perfunctory. Applicable principles\\n\\nIt was open to Hamilton and AMC to cast their contractual relationship in a way which could, for certain purposes at least, have obliged AMC to act in Hamilton's interests alone or, distinctly, in their joint interests: cf Gibson Motorsport Merchandise at [7]-[16]. They chose to formalise their relationship as one of supplier and distributor, a type of relationship which characteristically is designed, subject to contractual limitations, to serve the several interests of the participants: see Hospital Products Ltd v United States Surgical Corporation ; Rickel v Schwinn Bicycle Co . The Distribution Agreement, and the parties conduct under in it in relation to the packaging was quite characteristic of this. Dr Keung was permitted to serve AMC's interests in selling products it acquired from Hamilton, by utilising artwork and language which he considered would facilitate the sale of those products in the area of the Agreement, so furthering AMC's own interests. Hamilton, in turn, would thereby have its own interests served to the extent that enhanced sales by AMC would be likely to lead to enhanced orders from Hamilton. While AMC was given latitude in the language so used, Hamilton in turn was able to protect its own interests in this matter. It retained for itself a right to approve all statements made on the packaging because of its exposure to product liability and it insisted that the two language versions had to match (to comply with requirements of the TGA scheme). There was nothing fiduciary in this arrangement though it doubtless required elements of trust, cooperation and reliance by the parties if it was to work effectively. But these element of themselves did not turn a non-fiduciary contractual relationship into a fiduciary and personal one outside of, and potentially inconsistent with, the contract itself: cf Gibson Motorsport Merchandise at [11].\",\"36\":\"Section 52 has, over the last 35 years, been the subject of considerable judicial exegesis.

It is not necessary for me to enter upon whether such works as he may have produced prior to AMC's formation in December 1990 were held on trust for a company to be formed: cf A-One Accessory Imports Pty Ltd v Off Road Imports Pty Ltd (1996) 65 FCR 478 at 491-2. I simply note there is no evidence to this effect. I likewise have no evidence of his having a contract of service with AMC after December 1990 pursuant to which the AMC Packaging was created: cf Copyright Act , s 35(6). However, I am satisfied that works presently in issue relating to packaging for Urederm were created after 1990. It is, for example, Dr Keung's evidence that the real departures in the Urederm product indications were only implemented in 1992. Importantly, I am not prepared to infer that in creating the works, Dr Keung did so as trustee for AMC. There is no documentary evidence corroborating any declaration of trust. There is, in contrast, documentary evidence prior to the October 2006 assignment of the Urederm copyright works in which Dr Keung clearly asserted his own copyright. So, for example, in the email to Mr Blake of 6 January 2003 he said: \\n \\n As long as AMC remains to be the sole distributor of Hamilton products in Hong Kong and China AMC will put our Chinese trademark FUYUNHON, my version of Chinese translation and my design in English on Hamilton products sold by our company. However, Hamilton should not sell any products bearing this logo and my copyright to any third parties unless prior approval has been obtained from AMC.\\n (Emphasis added.)\\n\\nThe evidence does not disclose any assignment by Dr Keung, or any surrender, of his copyright ownership to Hamilton. Subclause 30.2 of the Distribution agreement dealing with any improvement or adaptation of \\\"Products\\\" is of no avail to Hamilton. Construed in its context, what the subclause deemed to be the property of Hamilton was any adaptation or improvement of the particular commodities (Urederm, Rubesal, etc) that were the subjects of the Distribution Agreement.\",\"45\":\"The parties were so circumstances by their contract and in their relationship in consequence of it, that Hamilton had no entitlement reasonably to expect that AMC would act in Hamilton's interests to the exclusion of AMC's own self interest in relation to the Hong Kong Packaging or the English Language product indications for Urederm: see News Ltd v Australian Rugby Football League Ltd [1996] FCA 1256 ; (1996) 64 FCR 410 at 538-541.\\n\\nFinally, Dr Keung was the original owner of the copyright works. If he had remained such, AMC's copyright claim would have had no foundation. However, some at least of the copyright works (ie those relating to Urederm created between 1992 and 1999) were assigned to AMC in October 2006. In respect of these AMC can maintain its copyright claims. For ease of exposition I will hereafter call the assigned material \\\"the Urederm Labels\\\". These I would note contain, amongst other things, both the English language and Chinese character versions of the product indications.\\n\\nAMC's claim, as so reduced to the copyright works assigned to it, is that Hamilton made unauthorised reproductions of what I have called Urederm Labels and so breached Dr Keung's copyright in those labels for which AMC now sues as assignee. AMC acknowledged, though, that since 1992 it authorised Hamilton to reproduce such labels for the purpose of packaging products to be supplied to AMC. As put in its submissions, AMC claims that each unauthorised sale Hamilton made of Urederm was a publication within s 31 of the Copyright Act . The sales to Crafers, Pharmalines and \\\"[o]ther undisclosed persons in Australia were infringements\\\". AMC also submits that Hamilton should be ordered to discover all of its records of Urederm \\\"incorporating the product descriptions authored by Dr Keung and sold to third parties (ie not AMC)\\\".\",\"46\":\"Hamilton's response to the breach claim for present purposes is twofold. First, the pleaded breach is of \\\"reproduction\\\" of the Urederm Label without the licence of AMC, ie a contravention of s 36(1) of the Act, reproduction being an exclusive right comprised in the copyright: s 31(1)(a)(i). Hamilton contends that (i) there is no evidence that Hamilton itself reproduced the Labels, though there is slight evidence from which it could be inferred it \\\"authorised\\\" reproductions; (ii) AMC has neither particularised nor proved that any acts of reproduction that were done without its licence, ie its \\\"permission\\\" or \\\"consent\\\": Computermate Products (Aust) Pty Ltd v Ozi-Soft Pty Ltd (1988) 20 FCR 46 at 49; and (iii) if Hamilton was authorised to reproduce the labels for the purposes of packaging products to be supplied to AMC and did this, if it later sold those products to a third party, it would not have contravened s 36(1) by reproduction without licence.\",\"47\":\"Secondly, it is contended that AMC should not be permitted to amend its case in final submissions to raise a breach of s 38 of the Copyright Act arising from the unauthorised sale of products. The premise of this contention (contrary to AMC's written submission) would seem to be that such a sale would not in the circumstances have been a \\\"publication\\\" ie a first publication in Australia: see Avel Pty Ltd v Multicoin Amusements Pty Ltd [1990] HCA 58 ; (1990) 171 CLR 88 at 93 for the purposes of s 31(1)(a)(ii) of the Act.\\n\\nSection 38(1) provides insofar as presently relevant: \\n \\n 38(1) Subject to Division 3, the copyright in a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work is infringed by a person who, in Australia, and without the licence of the owner of the copyright: \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n (a) sells ... an article; \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n ... \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n if the person knew, or ought reasonably to have known, that the making of the article constituted an infringement of the copyright ...\\n (Emphasis added.)\\n\\nHamilton submitted it did not address the case now put at trial, but that in any event AMC has neither pleaded nor proved the elements of s 38 and in particular that Hamilton knew, or ought reasonably to have known, that the \\\" making \\\" of the packaging embodying the Urederm labels constituted an infringement of the copyright.\\n\\nI should indicate at the outset that I will not permit AMC so late in the day to raise what it curiously claims is infringement by \\\"publication\\\". It has not established that any sale infringed its right of \\\"first publication\\\": cf Avel Pty Ltd , at 93. The claim, as Hamilton correctly suggests is for a contravention of s 38(1). I am satisfied that that claim would fail in any event. It is subject to the same vice as the \\\"reproduction\\\" claim.\\n\\nAs to the claim of infringement by reproduction without licence, I agree in substance with Hamilton's submissions. The parties obviously did not turn their mind in any way collectively to the question of copyright in the Urederm labels or for that matter the packaging generally. It is reasonable to infer that Hamilton proceeded wrongly on the assumption that copyright in the packaging belonged to it. Be this as it may, the parties so conducted themselves in relation to Dr Keung's copyright as resulted in Hamilton in fact having Dr Keung's licence to reproduce the AMC packaging, oblivious though they may have been to this legal characterisation of the matter. The question whether or not permission or consent has been given to reproduction is an objective one. The scope of the licence so given by Dr Keung is a matter of inference. While it is the case that no express limitations on reproduction were conveyed to Hamilton prior to Hamilton's sales to Crafers and Pharmalines, I consider it improbable that Dr Keung could reasonably be said to have consented to reproduction other than for the purposes of their relationship, ie for sale to AMC. I find accordingly.\",\"48\":\"AMC has not attempted to show when the offending reproductions without permission or consent occurred. The onus in this is on it: cf Nationwide News Pty Ltd v Copyright Agency Ltd [1995] FCA 1045 ; (1995) 55 FCR 271 at 288. The limited evidence that could be said to bear on this matter, does not suggest that the product sold otherwise than to AMC was produced for the purposes of such sales. On the contrary some such sales appear to have been drawn from stock made for AMC. It has not been suggested that Hamilton increased its production so as to accommodate the need to meet its AMC sales.\\n\\nIn the circumstances I am in no position to find that when Hamilton reproduced the Urederm labels on its packaging it did so otherwise than in accordance with Dr Keung's licence. Its later conduct in effecting sales of such product may have been an actionable wrong to AMC. It was not the wrong pleaded against Hamilton.\\n\\nI reject AMC's breach of copyright claim.\",\"49\":\"As is not uncommonly the case, several of the misleading or deceptive conduct claims AMC has made have been twinned with passing off claims. It is appropriate in this setting to refer to observations of the Full Federal Court in Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 70 ; (2007) 159 FCR 397 at [98] - [99] which bring out the distinction between these two species of action: There is an overlap between causes of action arising under Pt V of the Trade Practices Act and the common law tort of passing off. However, the causes of action have distinct origins and the purposes and interests that both bodies of law primarily protect are contrasting. Passing off protects a right of property in business or goodwill whereas Pt V is concerned with consumer protection. Part V is not restricted by common law principles relating to passing off and provides wider protection than passing off.\\n Whether or not there is a requirement for some exclusive reputation as an element in the common law tort of passing off, there is no such requirement in relation to Pt V of the Trade Practices Act . The question is not whether an applicant has shown a sufficient reputation in a particular get-up or name. The question is whether the use of the particular get-up or name by an alleged wrongdoer in relation to his product is likely to mislead or deceive persons familiar with the claimant's product to believe that the two products are associated, having regard to the state of the knowledge of consumers in Australia of the claimant's product.\\n\\nThere are two claims made of contraventions of s 52 and s 53 of the Trade Practices Act .\\n\\nThe first is that in the supply of the Products subject to the Distribution Agreement to Crafers for sale into the Hong Kong market, constituted a representation to Crafers that Hamilton was authorised to supply those Products for that purpose. It was not so authorised and the representation was false, hence it contravened s 52 and s 53(c) of the Act. Having rejected the parallel importation claim upon which this is premised, it too must fail at least as pleaded.\",\"50\":\"Obviously the product sold to Crafers was intended for resale to a class of persons whom the Chinese language characters could address. On the findings I have made that intended class, insofar as Hamilton was concerned, was not that of Chinese language reading Hong Kong consumers. Hamilton did not supply Crafers for the purpose of resale in Hong Kong. The Product was to be resold in Australia. The intended addressees were crew and passengers on ships docking in Australian ports. There is no evidence to suggest that \\\"a not insignificant number\\\" of members of these classes were likely to be misled or deceived by the Chinese characters: see Hansen Beverage Co v Bickfords (Australia) Pty Ltd [2008] FCAFC 181 ; (2008) 171 FCR 579. Rather, Crafers sold the Products (seemingly directly and indirectly) to a Hong Kong importer for resale. This was without Hamilton's knowledge or consent and contrary to the understanding it had with Crafers as to resale. Hamilton bore no responsibility for the conduct thus engaged in in Hong Kong. I say this quite independently of the s 5 problem which AMC would have had if Hamilton could otherwise have been found responsible for representations made to Hong Kong consumers.\\n\\nI reject both of the misleading or deceptive conduct claims.\\n\\nAMC claims that the supply by Hamilton of products bearing the Fuyunhon and Tuotoning trademarks constituted a misrepresentation calculated to deceive its prospective and actual Hamilton customers and the end users of the Products, that the Products were the products of AMC. Such representation was made in the course of trade. As with the preceding misleading or deceptive conduct claims, AMC's pleading of, and submissions on, this cause of action are brief to the point of being unhelpful. Hamilton's in contrast are exhaustive. Here again, AMC has not sought to engage with what has been put against it.\\n\\nConsidering first the misrepresentation allegedly made in Australia to Crafers, I commence with the well accepted proposition that: \\n \\n The law of passing off does not confer protection on the owners of goods who have no reputation in a particular jurisdiction: Con Agra Inc , at 343. \\n \\n\\n \\nOr, as it is sometimes put, an applicant in \\\"a passing off action\\\" must establish that it had \\\"the requisite reputation in the name or goods in the jurisdiction of the respondent\\\": Hansen Beverage Co , at [34].\\n\\nWhether an applicant has developed a particular reputation is a question of fact. There is no evidence that either AMC as an entity or the Chinese language marks had any reputation at all in Australia at the relevant date let alone that a substantial number of people in Australia were aware of the Chinese language marks on the goods they distinguished: Hansen Beverage Co , at [34]-[35]. This alone would be sufficient to reject the Australian based aspect of the passing off claim.\",\"51\":\"There are a significant number of difficulties which doom this claim. I will refer to several of these. By way of preface I refer to the description of the tort of passing off given by Lord Diplock in Erven Warnink BV v J Townsend & Sons [1980] RPC 31 at 93 and do so as AMC's pleading of its claim tracks this description: \\n \\n My Lords, Spalding v Gamage and the later cases make it possible to identify five characteristics which must be present in order to create a valid cause of action for passing off: (1) a misrepresentation (2) made by a trader in the course of trade (3) to prospective customers of his or ultimate consumers of goods or services supplied by him, (4) which is calculated to injure the business or goodwill of another trader (in the sense that this is a reasonably foreseeable consequence) and (5) which causes actual damage to a business or goodwill of the trader by whom the action is brought or (in a quia timet action) will probably do so. \\n \\n\\n \\nSee generally, Shanahan's Australian Law of Trade Marks & Passing Off , Ch 20 (3 rd ed, 2003); Kerly's Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names , Ch 15 (14 th ed, 2005); see also Trindade, Cane and Lunney, The Law of Torts in Australia , 6.5 (4 th ed, 2007).

Further, no attempt has been made by AMC to make out a case of passing off by reference to those persons who, on my findings, constituted the classes of purchasers to which any representation made in the supply to Crafers was addressed, ie the passengers and crew of ships, not consumers in Hong Kong. I would note in this that it is well accepted that if a product packaged in such a way as will deceive the ultimate consumers to be addressed by the packaging, it is no defence that wholesalers or retailers with whom the deceiver deals, are not themselves deceived: see Singer Manufacturing Co v Loog (1880) 18 Ch D 395 at 412; Shanahan at [20.175]; Kerly at 15-201.\\n\\nAs to the claim of passing off to Hong Kong consumers, consistent with what I said in the misleading or deceptive conduct claims, such misrepresentations as may have been made (I make no finding to that effect) were not the responsibility of Hamilton. The Hong Kong market was not the relevant market in which the product sold by Hamilton to Crafers was to be sold.

I am prepared, for present purposes, to assume that Dr Keung owed a duty of confidence directly to Hamilton. He was the actual recipient of information which he had reason to know was to be kept confidential, albeit he received it for AMC which in turn owed a duty of confidence directly to Hamilton. If, for example, he used such information for his own private purposes which resulted in a gain for him or a loss to Hamilton, he would have been liable therefore at the suit of Hamilton: see Saltman Engineering Co Ltd v Campbell Engineering Co Ltd , at 213; and without the need for any circularity of action by joining AMC as a party.

The first is the \\\"reasonable person\\\" test and derives from Megarry J's judgment in Coco (at 48): \\n If the circumstances are such that any reasonable person standing in the shoes of the recipient of the information would have realised that upon reasonable grounds the information was being given in confidence, this should suffice to impose on that person the equitable obligation of confidence: see Dean, [3.275]; see also Toulson and Phipps, 3-007 3-010.\\n\\nThis said, I equally am satisfied that there remained an area, albeit a circumscribed one, in which through experimentation and choice through \\\"the application of the skill and ingenuity of the human brain\\\": Coco , at 47 a product formula could be devised for the production of a 10% urea cream having distinctive, desired properties and that knowledge of that ratio would give a \\\"head start\\\" to use Mr Blake's description, to a person later seeking to produce a cream with such or similar properties.\\n\\nThe same, I would add, could be said of a method of manufacture devised for a product with such an ingredient ratio, though this is not presently relevant.\\n\\nNotwithstanding that there was no express reference to confidentiality when the three documents were provided to AMC in 1996 and that the documents on their face made no claim to confidentiality, I am satisfied that Dr Keung would at the time have appreciated the sensitive character of the documents and that they were being supplied to him for a particular purpose and no other and that he could only use them for that purpose. Equally, the circumstances were such that any reasonable man standing in Dr Keung's shoes in 1996 would have realised upon reasonable grounds, as his Vietnamese sub-distributor anticipated, that the information was being given to him in confidence: Coco , at 48. Whichever test is applied, the conclusion is inevitable that the production formula was received by AMC in confidence.\\n\\nIn the event that I made such findings, AMC has conceded that (i) the information was provided to Sphere\\/Tabco by AMC; (ii) Mr Wait used the formula (only in part) to provide a quotation for the manufacture of a 10% urea cream; and (iii) he used the formula (only in part) as a basis for manufacturing a 10% urea cream. It is said, as well, that in the trials and production of commercial batches, there were differences in the ingredients and ratios used. My only comment on the concession is that I consider it rather underplays the use made of the formula by Mr Wait. He was at Dr Keung's insistence keeping close to the formula, though some adjustments were made before commercial quantities were produced. I do not accept AMC's submission that Sphere did no more than use the formula as a reference point for manufacturing a 10% urea cream.\\n\\nThis brings me to the contentious subject of remedy. That sought is an account of the profit made on the sale of the Sphere manufactured products containing urea cream.

Nonetheless, tested by the indicia of confidentiality to which I earlier referred, the ingredient ratios were not, on the evidence, in the public domain in 1996, or, for that matter, in 2006; they were valuable to Hamilton when used by it and, in 2006, they were valuable to AMC who was by then a prospective competitor; the formula resulted from Hamilton's research and experimentation and, as the evidence here indicated, for another person to acquire the same information would require it to go through a like process of experimentation; and the urea cream product was not, on the evidence, easily reverse engineered. While it was suggested to Mr Blake that it could be reverse engineered in a short time a suggestion with which he did not agree AMC did not adduce positive evidence to that effect. It had the opportunity to do so. Mr Wait was its witness.\",\"83\":\"While the Distribution Agreement clearly contemplated that there could be confidential information associated with the Products, what is surprising is that Hamilton appears not to have taken positive steps to preserve the secrecy of the formula in the hands of third parties to whom it was supplied. This said, it cannot properly be asserted that Hamilton so conducted itself in relation to AMC as reasonably to create the impression that it was making a fairly open invitation to AMC to make use of it: Amway Corporation v Eurway International Ltd [1974] RPC 82 at 87.\\n\\nThis brings me to the second matter. I am satisfied the production formula was confidential information for equitable and contractual purposes, but was it imparted in circumstances importing a duty of confidence? Again I think so.\",\"84\":\"The grant of this form of relief in breach of confidence cases is in the end a matter for the Court, notwithstanding a party's election for an account: see e.g. Seager v Copydex Ltd (No 1) [1967] RPC 349 ; see also Conveyor Co of Australia Pty Ltd v Cameron Bros Engineering Co Ltd [1973] 2 NZLR 38 at 44. An apparent reason for this is that, given the variable character of confidential information, its misuse even in a profit making activity may not realistically be able to be said to result in any profit being attributable to it, the misuse merely effecting what was in effect a saving of time and trouble: see Dean [8-320].\",\"85\":\"The grant of this form of relief in breach of confidence cases is in the end a matter for the Court, notwithstanding a party's election for an account: see e.g. Seager v Copydex Ltd (No 1) [1967] RPC 349 ; see also Conveyor Co of Australia Pty Ltd v Cameron Bros Engineering Co Ltd [1973] 2 NZLR 38 at 44.

Dr Keung, in my view, designedly was trying to replicate a product for which he had previously established product goodwill. An account is in the circumstances an appropriate form of relief: AMC should not be \\\"permitted to gain from [its] wrongdoing\\\": Attorney-General v Guardian Newspapers Ltd (No 2) [1990] 1 AC 109 at 262.\\n\\nI am satisfied that the period for which the account should be taken ought commence when AMC began to sell products manufactured in breach of confidence. It should end when sales of those products ceased in 2008 when AMC adopted the alternative formulation incorporating lactic acid. By that point the advantage gained for its misappropriation of the formula was practically spent. It had been overtaken by Sphere's independent endeavours to produce an acceptable product. Hamilton should not be given the benefit of those endeavours. If there was some residue of advantage remaining with AMC from the misuse of the formula, it is inappropriate to attempt to make some apportionment of profits in recognition of it. To attempt that would inevitably be burdensome and unrewarding. Significantly, Hamilton has, because of the product change, abandoned its claim for a permanent injunction.\",\"87\":\"While the accounting remedy is not without its known difficulties (see Dean [8.325]), I do not have material before me nor have I had considered submissions which would suggest that such might emerge here. That in any event is a matter for Hamilton. It can have obvious costs implications: cf Nokia Corporation v Liu [2009] FCAFC 138. If an account is to be taken I will direct it be before the District Registrar of the Court and I will give liberty to apply for directions in relation to the taking of the account.\",\"88\":\"Hamilton also seeks an order that AMC deliver up the originals and copies of two of the three documents it \\\"holds\\\". No such order is sought against Sphere in respect of the two documents it received. AMC converted the hard copy versions of the documents into electronic form for sending to Sphere. I have not been addressed on the \\\"delivery up\\\" or \\\"destruction\\\" of the electronic versions. I will invite further submissions on this matter: see also Prime Creative Media Pty Ltd v Vranjkovic [2009] FCA 1030 at [17] .\",\"89\":\"Insofar as concerns the claim for breaches of cl 28 of the Distribution Agreement, I am satisfied such breaches have been established.

I am prepared, for present purposes, to assume that Dr Keung owed a duty of confidence directly to Hamilton. He was the actual recipient of information which he had reason to know was to be kept confidential, albeit he received it for AMC which in turn owed a duty of confidence directly to Hamilton. If, for example, he used such information for his own private purposes which resulted in a gain for him or a loss to Hamilton, he would have been liable therefore at the suit of Hamilton: see Saltman Engineering Co Ltd v Campbell Engineering Co Ltd , at 213; and without the need for any circularity of action by joining AMC as a party.
