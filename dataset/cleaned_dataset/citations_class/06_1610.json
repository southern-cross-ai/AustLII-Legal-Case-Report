The concept of legal privilege is founded on the special significance that the Court attaches to the informed resolution of disputes in the court system and the application of the law to those disputes. In consequence, the communications which arise from that professional relationship are given special significance: see, for instance, Baker v Campbell [1983] HCA 39 ; (1983) 153 CLR 52 at 128 for a discussion of the rationale underlying the privilege. In essence, the purpose of legal privilege is to facilitate the giving of advice in the conduct of adversarial litigation to ensure that there is open communication between clients and legal advisers.\\n\\n12 I consider that Documents 10-14 inclusive are privileged for the above reasons.\\n\\n13 Document 15 is an affidavit by a son of the bankrupt whose only involvement in the bankruptcy of his parents was that he filed an initial debtor's petition in the estate of his father, which was subsequently set aside.
