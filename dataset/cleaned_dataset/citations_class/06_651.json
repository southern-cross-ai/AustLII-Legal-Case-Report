The applicant was invited to file written submissions on the question of whether the Court should make an order nisi . On 7 December 2004, the applicant filed an amended application under the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth), however, he has not filed any written submissions.\\n\\n5 I propose to deal with this application on the papers.\\n\\n18 This claim in form may be prima facie capable of attracting relief under the second limb of the Muin ratio decidendi, that is, that the applicant was misled into thinking that favourable country information had been considered by the Tribunal when in fact it had not. However, the material contained in the draft order nisi and the affidavit in support merely amounts to a pleading or assertion of the right to relief. There are no particulars or evidence of facts that would support the grant of the relief claimed. None of the country information is identified. For orders requiring the respondent to show cause why final relief should not be granted, the applicant must provide material showing that there is at least an arguable case for the grant of the final relief claimed.\\n\\n19 On the material before me, the applicant has not made out an arguable case that the Tribunal committed jurisdictional error. The application for an order nisi should therefore be dismissed with costs.\\n \\n\\n I certify that the preceding nineteen (19) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Tamberlin. \\n\\n\\nAssociate:\\n\\nDated: 30 May 2006\\n\\n\\n The Applicant is self-represented. \\n \\n \\n Solicitor for the Respondent: Australian Government Solicitor \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 30 May 2006 \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2006\\/651.html\",\"1\":\"14 Subsection 424A(3)(b) provides that s 424A does not apply to information \\\"that the applicant gave for the purposes of the application\\\".
