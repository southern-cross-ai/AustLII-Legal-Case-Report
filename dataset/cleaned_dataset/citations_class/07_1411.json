I will not repeat those matters here.\\n\\n3 The Amended Cross-Claim alleges that, in breach of a lease (\\\"the Lease\\\") with Rosanza, Peninsula Hospital Management Pty Limited (\\\"Peninsula\\\") as lessee, has failed to pay rent, GST, outgoings, insurance premiums and interest in the amount of $419,129.40 to Rosanza.\\n\\n4 In paragraph 1 of the Defence to the Amended Cross-Claim, the cross-respondents admit that they are in breach of the Lease because Peninsula failed to pay the above amount. However, that admission is made subject to paragraphs 8 and 9, which deny that Rosanza is entitled to any relief sought due. This non-entitlement, it is said, is due to Peninsula's claims in the principal proceeding, or to the contention that the rent and other payments due under the Lease were abated to nil from the commencement of the Lease by reason of clause 11.\"}}"
