This is a further clear statement of the question which the CEO was required to address.\\n\\n159 The chapter contains findings of material injury including the loss of approximately 213,000 units representing 8% of the total market, as well as price depression of about 8% in the market for 120 litre MGBs.\",\"14\":\"207 The authorities confine the duty to investigate to rare and exceptional circumstances.

In my view, what really underlies Dr Flick's attack on the decision is that it was based on findings or inferences of fact that were not supported by probative material or logical grounds; see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Eshetu [1999] HCA 21 ; (1999) 197 CLR 611 at [145] ; Re Minister For Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Applicant S20\\/2002 (2003) 198 ALR 59.\\n\\n220 I do not consider that these findings were so unreasonable that no reasonable authority could have arrived at them; see Eshetu at [136]; Buck v Bavone [1976] HCA 24 ; (1976) 135 CLR 110 at 118-119.\\n\\n221 The CEO was not bound to accept the contractor's statement. Of course, a different fact finder may have reached a different view. But, as Gummow J said in Eshetu at [137]: \\n \\n \\n ... where the criterion of which the authority is required to be satisfied turns upon factual matters upon which reasonable minds could reasonably differ, it will be very difficult to show that no reasonable decision-maker could have arrived at the decision in question. It may be otherwise if the evidence which establishes or denies, or, with other matters, goes to establish or to deny, that the necessary criterion has been met was all one way.\\n\\n222 I do not consider that the evidence was all one way. It was open for the CEO to find that, notwithstanding the contractor's stated views, the position would have been different if the MGBs were offered at undumped prices.\\n\\n223 Dr Flick submitted that the omission of the confidential material from the SEF, the Report and the public site visit report for Coffs indicated perversity on the part of the CEO. He submitted that s 269ZJ(4) cannot be construed so as to confer upon Customs a power to select from the information which it has been told and to exclude from the public record other information of which it is aware.\",\"16\":\"255 In order to make out a finding of actual bias, an applicant must demonstrate that the decision-maker was guilty of pre-judgment. He or she must be committed to a conclusion, and not open to a contrary view, whatever arguments or evidence may be presented; see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia [2001] HCA 17 ; (2001) 205 CLR 507 at [71] - [72] ; SCAA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 668 at [36] .\",\"17\":\"165 Section 269TEA(5) of the Act is in similar terms to s 430(1)(c) and (d) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth). Thus, the CEO is only required to set out in the report to the Minister the findings which he did make; he is not required to set out findings additional to those which he actually made. What is required is the material findings of fact which the CEO actually made and upon which he based his recommendation; see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 at [67] - [68] .\\n\\n166 The CEO is required by s 269TEA(5)(b) of the Act to provide particulars of the evidence relied on in support of the findings. But it is not necessary for him to refer to every piece of evidence put before him; the Court will infer that matters not mentioned were not considered to be material; see Yusuf at [69]; see also Applicant WAEE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2003) 75 ALD 630 at [46].\\n\\n169 However, Schaefer's approach to construction is contrary to that which is laid down by the High Court in Yusuf . The Report contains the findings the CEO did make on these facts. He is not required to go further. He is required only to make recommendations and set out his material findings on which the recommendations were based. He is not required to provide the Minister with competing interpretations of the evidence so as to allow the Minister to make the ultimate decision.\\n\\n170 That is not the scheme of Part XVB. What is required is the CEO's recommendation and findings. The Minister is not bound to accept the recommendation. He or she is required to reach the state of satisfaction as to whether dumping caused material injury as provided in s 269TG.\\n\\n171 The effect of this ground, as argued by Schaefer, is that the finding of causation cannot be supported because the CEO did not disclose material facts known to him as to the reasons why the tenders were successful. Alternatively, it was submitted that, in light of the primary materials, the CEO's findings as to the importance of price were stated in a misleading way.\",\"18\":\"148 This test was applied by the Full Court in Fraser and by other Full Courts in Enichem Anic Srl v Anti-Dumping Authority (1992) 39 FCR 458 at 470 and Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs v La Doria di Diodata Ferraiolli SPA (1994) 33 ALD 35 at 48.

The first is that the information provided by some of the councils, eg Canterbury, pointed to price and non-price factors without differentiating between the relative importance of those factors. Thus, it was said to be irrational, perverse or unreasonable to make a finding of causation without knowing more about those factors.\\n\\n216 The second strand is that for a number of the councils, most notably Eurobodalla and Coffs Coast, there was material in the site visit reports which clearly stated the contractor's view that price was not determinative.

The SEF is to contain a statement of the facts on which the CEO proposes to base a recommendation to the Minister as to whether or not to impose duties; see s 269TDAA.\\n\\n7 A further step in the process is for the CEO, after holding an investigation into the application, to report to the Minister.

Section 269ZJ provides, relevantly: \\n \\n \\n Section 269ZJ CEO to maintain public record for certain purposes \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n (1) The CEO must, in relation to each application received under section 269TB that leads to an investigation, each application or request under section 269ZA that leads to a review and each application under section 269ZHB that leads to an inquiry: \\n \\n \\n \\n (a) maintain a public record of the investigation, review or inquiry conducted for the purposes of the application or request, containing, subject to subsection (2), a copy of all submissions from interested parties, the statement of essential facts compiled in respect of that investigation, review or inquiry, and a copy of all relevant correspondence between the CEO and other persons; and \\n (b) draw the attention of all interested parties to the existence of the public record, and to their entitlement to inspect that record; and \\n (c) at the request of an interested party, make the record available to that party for inspection. \\n \\n \\n \\n (2) To the extent that information given to the CEO by a person is claimed to be confidential or to be information whose publication would adversely affect a person's business or commercial interests, the person giving that information must ensure that a summary of that information: \\n \\n \\n \\n (a) that contains sufficient detail to allow a reasonable understanding of the substance of the information; but \\n (b) that does not breach that confidentiality or adversely affect those interests; \\n \\n \\n \\n is given to the CEO for inclusion in the public record. \\n (3) A person is not required to give the CEO a summary of information under subsection (2) for inclusion in the public record if the person satisfies the CEO that there is no way such a summary can be given to allow a reasonable understanding of the substance of the information. \\n (4) If oral information is given to the CEO by a person, the CEO must not take that information into account unless it is subsequently put in writing by the person or by the CEO and thereby becomes available, subject to considerations of confidentiality and to the need to protect business and commercial interests, as a part of the public record. \\n \\n \\n \\n [...]\\n\\n43 The purpose, background and proper approach to construction of Part XVB were explained in Pilkington at [19]-[28]. I will summarise the essential points.\\n\\n44 Part XVB reflects, in substance, amendments to the Act made by legislation passed in 1994 and 1998. I will not repeat the titles of those enactments; Pilkington at [22].\\n\\n45 The provisions of the implementation agreement negotiated in the Uruguay Round of the GATT were summarised in Pilkington at [22]. Article VI of that Agreement appears to be the genesis of s 269ZJ of the Act. It provides, inter alia , that, subject to the requirement to protect confidential information, evidence presented in writing by an interested party should be made available promptly to other interested parties.\\n\\n46 Article VI also provides that oral information is to be taken into account by the authorities only insofar as it is subsequently reproduced in writing and made available to other interested parties.\\n\\n47 The Second Reading Speech of the Bill, which became the 1998 Act, included a statement set out in Pilkington at [23]. This was that, \\\"throughout an investigation all interested parties must have a full opportunity to see all relevant information, to acquaint themselves with opposing views and to offer rebuttal arguments\\\".\\n\\n48 The provisions of Part XVB are to be interpreted and applied, as far as the language permits, in accordance with Australia's international obligations; Pilkington at [25].\\n\\n49 A broad approach to construction is to be adopted; Pilkington at [26]-[27].\\n\\n50 Over a period of about 15 months ending in July 2005, Schaefer won five large Australian contracts for the supply of MGBs. These were with local councils or their contractors as follows: \\n \\n \\n \\u2022 Ku-ring-gai Collex Pty Limited\\n \\u2022 Canterbury City Council\\n \\u2022 Bega Valley Watts Waste\\n \\u2022 Eurobodalla Staples Waste Removals Pty Limited \\n \\n\\n\\u2022 Coffs Coast SMS Municipal Services Pty Limited (which uses Handybin Waste Services (Coffs Harbour) Pty Limited, a related company, to supply waste services)\\n\\n51 On 23 September 2005 Nylex Limited and Sulo MGB Australia Pty Limited lodged an application under s 269TB(1) of the Act requesting the Minister to publish a dumping notice.\\n\\n133 Two things underlie the legislative scheme. The first is a high level of transparency, with opportunities for interested parties to comment and tender evidence at each relevant stage of the process; see Pilkington at [56]. The second is the formalisation and expansion of the public file system which was intended to make available to interested parties the material which would enable them to defend their interests; see Pilkington at [22]-[23].\\n\\n134 These objectives are reflected in particular in ss 269TC(4), 269TDAA(2), 269TEA(3) and 269ZJ(1)-(4).\\n\\n135 Moreover, s 269TDAA(1) makes it plain that the statement of essential facts is not a report to the Minister upon which the Minister is to make his or her decision. Rather, it is a document which the CEO must place on the public record for the benefit of interested parties.\\n\\n181 It is true that the apparent purpose of s 269ZJ is to give effect to the policy of transparency which underlies the statutory scheme in Part XVB of the Act. Thus, the CEO's recommendation should ordinarily to be made only by reference to that which is available on the public record. This enables interested parties to defend their interests; see Article VI of the Implementation Agreement for the Uruguay Round of GATT; see also Pilkington at [22], [23] and [28].\\n\\n182 However, I do not accept Dr Flick's submission as to the proper construction of s 269ZJ(4). The flaw in his argument is that it fails to take into account the provisions of s 269ZJ(2) and (3) which make special provision for the inclusion of some details of the confidential information to be placed on the public record.\\n\\n183 Section 269ZJ(2) provides that a person giving information to the CEO that is claimed to be confidential must ensure that a summary of that information is given to the CEO for inclusion in the public record. The summary must contain sufficient detail to allow a reasonable understanding of the substance of the information and is to be given in a way that does not breach confidentiality.\\n\\n283 I agree with the submission of the respondents that most of the changes between the SEF and the Trade Measures Report were as a result of considering and responding to the applicant's post-SEF submissions. There is no obligation on the Minister to provide a copy of the Trade Measures Report before making any decision to impose dumping duties, nor to consider any material outside the Report; see Pilkington at [126].\",\"25\":\"22 The issues may be summarised as follows: \\n \\n \\n (1) Whether, upon the proper construction and application of s 269TDAA of the Act, the SEF was required to contain a statement of all material facts known to Customs at the time of preparation.\\n (2) Whether the CEO made an error of law, or asked himself the wrong question, by failing to consider whether the Minister ought to be satisfied of a causal link between the price of the goods and material injury to an Australian industry; see s 269 TEA(1)(d), s 269TG(1).\\n (3) Whether the Trade Measures Report contravened s 269TEA(5) by failing to include a statement of the CEO's reasons for his recommendation that set out the material findings of fact and particulars of the evidence relied on to support the findings.\\n (4) Whether Schaefer was deprived of the statutory opportunity to respond to the SEF by reason of the non-disclosure of material facts known to the CEO. These facts are said to be the statements by the purchasers of the MGBs of factors, other than price, which influenced their decisions.\\n (5) Whether the CEO failed to conduct an investigation in accordance with Div 2 of Part XVB, by failing to make any further enquiry of the purchasers as to whether price was the causative factor. Schaefer relies upon the principle stated by Wilcox J in Prasad v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1985) 6 FCR 155 to enliven a duty to make further enquiries in the present case.\\n (6) Whether the SEF or the Trade Measures Report was perverse or affected by Wednesbury unreasonableness in light of the factual material contained in the site visit reports.\\n (7) In addition to (6), whether the SEF or the Trade Measures Report was affected by bias.\\n (8) Whether the power of the Minister to make a declaration pursuant to s 269TG was vitiated by an error in the SEF placed on the public record, or an error in the Trade Measures Report provided to the Minister, or otherwise involved a denial of procedural fairness.\\n (9) Whether, in any event, relief ought to be declined on discretionary grounds. This issue arises because Schaefer has sought merits review of the Minister's decision from the Trade Measures Review Officer in accordance with Div 9 of Part XVB.\\n\\n207 The authorities confine the duty to investigate to rare and exceptional circumstances. It is limited to cases where it is obvious that material is readily available that is centrally relevant to the decision; see Prasad at 169-170; Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Singh (1997) 74 FCR 553 at 558-559, 561; Luu v Renevier (1989) 91 ALR 39 at 50; Azzi v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCA 24 ; (2002) 120 FCR 48 at [102] - [112] .\\n\\n208 Given that the CEO did investigate the central question, the duty which Schaefer seeks to impose, namely a duty to ask further questions, does not fit neatly within the formulation expressed in Prasad and the other cases.\",\"26\":\"284 The Court has a discretion to refuse relief under s 39B of the Judiciary Act if a more convenient and satisfactory remedy exists; see R v Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration; Ex parte Ozone Theatres (Aust) Ltd [1949] HCA 33 ; (1949) 78 CLR 389 at 400. See also Wyeth Australia Pty Ltd v Minister for Health and Aged Care (2000) 61 ALD 372 at [47].\",\"27\":\"141 To the extent that Dr Flick's submissions rested upon the proposition that the CEO is required to expose his or her reasoning in advance of the provision of the report to the Minister under s 269TEA, this would be contrary to well-established authority; Commissioner for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd (1994) 49 FCR 576 at 591-592. See also Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; Ex parte Palme [2003] HCA 56 ; (2003) 216 CLR 212.\",\"28\":\"257 The test for reasonable apprehension of bias in curial proceedings is whether a \\\"fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question\\\" that is to be decided; see Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex parte H [2001] HCA 28 ; (2001) 179 ALR 425 at [27] . See also Antoun v The Queen [2006] HCA 2 ; (2006) 224 ALR 51 at [51] ; Ebner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy [2000] HCA 63 ; (2000) 205 CLR 337 at [6] .\\n\\n258 For administrative proceedings, the test is expressed by reference to a hypothetical fair-minded lay person, properly informed of the nature of the proceeding, the matters that are in issue and the conduct which is said to give rise to the claimed apprehension of bias; se Ex parte H at [28].\\n\\n259 The substance of Schaefer's claim of bias was that the five councils gave central information to Customs \\\"which slipped off the table\\\" and did not find its way into the SEF or Trade Measures Report.\\n\\n260 Dr Flick pointed in particular to the statements made by the contractor for Coffs that whilst price was an issue, quality was the determining factor and there was a breakdown in the relationship with the relevant Australian supplier.\",\"29\":\"255 In order to make out a finding of actual bias, an applicant must demonstrate that the decision-maker was guilty of pre-judgment. He or she must be committed to a conclusion, and not open to a contrary view, whatever arguments or evidence may be presented; see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia [2001] HCA 17 ; (2001) 205 CLR 507 at [71] - [72] ; SCAA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 668 at [36] .\\n\\n256 An applicant bears a heavy onus; it will rarely be discharged by pointing solely to the reasons of the decision-maker or adverse fact finding; see SCAA at [36]-[38].\\n\\n268 As von Doussa J said in SCAA at [38], even where it is possible to show that findings are contrary to evidence, or unreasonable, or that the reasoning process is hopelessly flawed, that, without more, is unlikely to demonstrate pre-judgment amounting to bias. Here, the most that can be said is that the findings of fact are highly contestable.\\n\\n269 I dealt, under Issue 6, with the question of compliance with the EN840 standard in the Coffs contract. Customs considered and dealt with Schaefer's submission. It seems to me that the way in which it addressed that question shows that its decision was not affected by actual or apprehended bias.\\n\\n270 There was nothing in the other matters recorded in Schaefer's written submissions which could make good the claim of bias. They are all complaints about fact finding.\",\"30\":\"147 The test for causation of material injury was said by Lockhart J in Swan Portland Cement Ltd v Minister for Small Business and Customs (1991) 28 FCR 135 at 144 to be \\\"essentially a practical exercise\\\". His Honour said that its purpose is to achieve the objective of determining whether, viewed as a whole, the relevant Australian industry is suffering material injury from the dumping.\\n\\n149 Moreover, the authorities referred to in the previous paragraphs establish that the determination is one of fact and degree; see eg Mullins at [20], Swan at 145.\\n\\n162 These findings seem to me to reflect the practical exercise in decision making contemplated by the test stated by Lockhart J in Swan which I referred to at [147] above. Whilst different minds may have come to different views on the preliminary findings as to the relevance of non-price factors, the determination is, as I have said, one of fact for the decision-maker. In making this determination, the CEO proceeded on the basis that factors other than price were given different prominence by different councils but that tenders were to be evaluated within a narrow price band. That was a question of fact for the CEO.\\n\\n163 The balance of Chapter 10 consists largely of a consideration of Schaefer's submissions, in particular customer preferences. I have set out the findings of the Report at [100] above. That passage and the conclusions which I have set out at [102] again show the necessary application of the test of causation.\\n\\n164 In my opinion, this ground of review fails.\",\"31\":\"284 The Court has a discretion to refuse relief under s 39B of the Judiciary Act if a more convenient and satisfactory remedy exists; see R v Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration; Ex parte Ozone Theatres (Aust) Ltd [1949] HCA 33 ; (1949) 78 CLR 389 at 400.
