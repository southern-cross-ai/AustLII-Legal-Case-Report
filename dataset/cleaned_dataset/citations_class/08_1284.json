"{\"id\":{\"0\":\"c0\"},\"class\":{\"0\":\"affirmed\"},\"tocase\":{\"0\":\"Singh & Ors v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2007] FMCA 1739\"},\"text\":{\"0\":\"1 This is an appeal to the Federal Court from the decision of Federal Magistrate Turner in Singh & Ors v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2007] FMCA 1739 given on 9 November 2007.\\n\\n2 His Honour found that by operation of s 46 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (the Act), the first appellant could not make a valid application for a Graduate Skilled (Class UQ) (Temporary), Subclass 497 visa lodged on 25 March 2002. His Honour concluded that the Migration Review Tribunal (the Tribunal) had made no error of law in reaching that conclusion.\\n\\n3 The appeal to this Court, while it has to be seen against a very extended and extensive history of litigation, ultimately involves a short point: the appellant contends that as condition 8534 of Schedule 8 of the Migration Regulations 1994 (Migration Regulations) does not contain the phrase \\\"despite anything else in this Act\\\", it is not a condition described in s 41(2)(a) of the Act, and therefore, s 46(1A) has no application to an application by a person who holds a visa that is subject to condition 8534.\\n\\n4 For the reasons which follow, I am satisfied that condition 8534 is a condition described in s 41(2)(a) of the Act, and the Tribunal and the Federal Magistrate were right to so conclude. The consequence is that the appeal has to be dismissed with costs.\\n\\n5 What follows are my reasons for that conclusion.\"}}"
