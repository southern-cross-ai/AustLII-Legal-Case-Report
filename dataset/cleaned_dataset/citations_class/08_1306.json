It is no part of the function of either court to consider the merits of a decision as made by the Tribunal: Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 281 2. To the extent that this Ground can be understood, it also seems to suffer from a more fundamental problem. In reaching the conclusion that it did, the Tribunal accepted the Appellant husband's own assessment as to the problems to be confronted in the future. How an acceptance of such evidence can constitute \\\" jurisdictional error \\\" also remained unexplained.\\n\\n14 The appeal must be dismissed with costs.

The Notice of Appeal as filed in this Court sets forth the following three Grounds of Appeal (without alteration):\\n 1. The Federal Magistrates Court erred in not considering that the Refugee Review Tribunal (the Tribunal) wrongly observed that the applicant would not involve in the politics in future because of his personal circumstances, the applicant said this because he wanted to avoid harm for himself and for his family and for his child. The applicant still believe that he would not be able to decide freely if he goes back to India. 2. The Federal Magistrates Court also did not consider that the Tribunal made a jurisdictional error when the Tribunal found that the threat to the applicant were made for reason arising from their friendship with the applicant's father in law's associates but the Tribunal did not consider that the applicant were threatened two occasions by the associates of his father in law. 3. The Federal Magistrates Court erred in not considering that the Tribunal made a jurisdictional error by observing that the applicant would not have threat given the effluxion of time but the Tribunal failed to show that the applicant will not face persecution in future if he returns to India.\\n\\n6 The Appellant husband appeared before this Court this morning unrepresented, although he did have the benefit of an interpreter. His wife did not appear.\\n\\n7 None of the Grounds of Appeal have been made out and the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\"}}"
