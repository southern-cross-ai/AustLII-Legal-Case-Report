In Attorney-General v Times Newspaper Ltd [1974] AC 273 at 309 Lord Diplock considered the requirements of the due administration of justice: \\n \\\"The due administration of justice requires first that all citizens should have unhindered access to the constitutionally established courts of criminal or civil jurisdiction for the determination of disputes as to their legal rights and liabilities; secondly, that they should be able to rely upon obtaining in the courts the arbitrament of a tribunal which is free from bias against any party and whose decision will be based upon those facts only that have been proved in evidence adduced before it in accordance with the procedure adopted in courts of law; and thirdly that, once the dispute has been submitted to a court of law, they should be able to rely upon there being no usurpation by any other person of the function of that court to decide it according to law. Conduct which is calculated to prejudice any of these three requirements or to undermine the public confidence that they will be observed is contempt of court.\\\"\",\"1\":\"The Applicant submitted that the CFMEU should be fined between $200,000.00 and $250,000.00 in relation to each of the two incidents of contempt and sought its costs on an indemnity basis. The Applicant urged the Court to impose an effective penalty, lest serious and lasting damage to the fabric of the law result: see Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 46 ; (1986) 161 CLR 98 at 115 (\\\" Mudginberri Station \\\").\\n\\nThe CFMEU accepted that it should pay the Applicant's costs of the penalty hearing, on a party-party basis, and submitted that a penalty in the sum of $10,000 was appropriate. It was submitted that, as the application for contempt was only partly successful, each party should bear its own costs of the two motions for contempt. PARTICIPATION OF THE ABCC\\n\\nSection 31(1) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) identifies the power possessed by this Court to punish contempts: \\n \\\"Subject to any other Act, the Court has the same power to punish contempts of its power and authority as is possessed by the High Court in respect of contempts of the High Court.\\\" \\n\\nThe power possessed by the High Court to punish contempts is specified in s 24 of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth): \\n \\n \\\"The High Court shall have the same power to punish contempts of its power and authority as is possessed at the commencement of this Act by the Supreme Court of Judicature in England.\\\" \\n\\n \\nWhen the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) commenced, the Supreme Court of Judicature in England had power to punish for contempt, whether civil or criminal: see Mudginberri Station at 105-106. The penalties the Court may impose depend on who is identified as the respondent to the proceeding: see High Court Rules 2004 (Cth) r 11.04.1. In this case, the only respondent was the CFMEU. None of the individual officers or members involved in the contempts was named as a respondent. Where, as here, the contemnor is a body corporate, r 11.04.1 (b) of the High Court Rules 2004 (Cth) provides that the Court may order: \\n \\n \\\"... that the contemnor pay a fine, that some or all of the property of the contemnor be sequestrated or that both the contemnor pay a fine and some or all of the property of the contemnor be sequestrated.\\\"\\n\\nThe considerations relevant to the determination of an appropriate penalty for contempt of Court were discussed by the High Court in Mudginberri Station ; see also Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v BHP Steel (AIS) Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 13 ; (2003) 196 ALR 350 (\\\" BHP Steel \\\") and Louis Vuitton Malletier SA v Design Elegance Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 83 ; (2006) 149 FCR 494 at 501-502.

Conduct which is calculated to prejudice any of these three requirements or to undermine the public confidence that they will be observed is contempt of court.\\\"\\n\\nThe CFMEU was determined not to obey the Order and did not make a reasonable attempt to comply with the Order: see Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v BHP Steel (AIS) Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 13 ; (2003) 196 ALR 350 at 358. The conduct of the CFMEU was not casual, accidental or unintentional and was therefore wilful for the purposes of the law of contempt: see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Info4PC.Com Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 949 ; (2002) 121 FCR 24 at 57; Mudginberri Station at 113.\\n\\nThe Applicant also submitted that the defiance of the Order was public in nature: see Mudginberri Station at 108. The Applicant tendered the transcript and a sound recording of a radio interview of Bill Oliver, Victorian Branch Secretary of the CFMEU Construction and General Division, in support of this contention. The tender was not objected to by the CFMEU, save as to relevance. The interview took place on 25 February 2009, the third day of the contempt hearing. It was broadcast on 774ABC radio. When asked by the interviewer \\\"[w]hy are your members blocking access to the site?\\\", Mr Oliver replied \\\"Well, we've got a problem down there ... and we've ended up in a court situation, sort of thing, at the moment.\\\" It was clear that Mr Oliver was referring to this Court. The Order was not mentioned. Counsel for the CFMEU contested the submission that the CFMEU was in public defiance of the Court's order. He contrasted the circumstances in Mudginberri Station where the union was found to be in public defiance of the court's order because the secretary of the union had stated publicly that the union would not pay the fine imposed by the Court with Mr Oliver's remarks.\\n\\nA public announcement of defiance of the kind which occurred in Mudginberri Station may readily be characterised as being \\\"public in nature\\\". The statement was made in circumstances where it was plainly intended that it would be reported and it was, in fact, widely disseminated in the media. Although Mr Oliver was interviewed on a radio station he did not make any statement that the union was defying or was intending to defy orders made by this Court. Plainly he was aware of the proceeding and he knew, or ought to have known, of the orders made by Marshall J. He did not, however, acknowledge that the union was acting in defiance of them. I do not, therefore, consider that the statements made by Mr Oliver during the radio interview can be said to have expressed defiance of the Court's orders.\\n\\nThere were, however, a number of acts of public defiance of the Court's orders at the Site. When presented with copies of the orders by representatives of the Applicant, a number of the CFMEU's officials either refused to accept them or allowed them to fall to the ground despite being advised of the nature of the documents. Statements were also made by some of the officials to the effect that they would act on advice from the union office rather than have regard to the terms of the orders which they were told required them to desist from obstructive action. This conduct occurred outside the Site gates and in the presence of employees of the Applicant. They constituted public acts of defiance even though they were not publicised to the wider community. Such defiance is not to be treated with the same gravity as defiance of the kind which occurred in Mudginberri Station . It is, however, a matter of relevance in fixing a penalty in the present case. Deterrence\",\"2\":\"In developing this contention the CFMEU relied on comments made by Gray J in Australian Competition & Consumer Commission v Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing & Kindred Industries Union [2004] FCA 517. In that case, three unions admitted to engaging in conduct in contravention of s 45D of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and agreed that each union should pay a penalty of $100,000.00. Gray J stated that he would have imposed a penalty considerably less than that agreed and, as the penalties were uniform, considered that no attempt had been made to attribute relative blame amongst the respondents. His Honour noted that:\\n\\nThe CFMEU emphasised the statement by Gray J (at [8]) that, \\\"[i]n these circumstances, to call upon the respondents each to pay such a large sum from their resources, which ultimately come from the pockets of wage-earners appears to be excessive.\\\" However, tellingly, his Honour also said (at [10]) that \\\"[a] factor that would tend to increase the size of the penalty is that the picket continued to be operated despite the orders of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission.\\\" It is also necessary to bear in mind that his Honour was not dealing with a charge of contempt, but with a penalty for admitted breaches of the Trade Practices Act where the penalty was capped by statute and in circumstances where the parties had agreed on a penalty which was greater than that his Honour would have otherwise ordered. Importantly, his Honour specifically held that, a breach of orders, made by the Commissioner, would warrant the imposition of a more severe penalty than might otherwise be called for.\\n\\nNo evidence was submitted by the CFMEU as to its financial position, or how the payment of a fine would penalise \\\"innocent persons\\\" not involved in the contempt. On the limited evidence before me, it is difficult to see how the payment of a fine would penalise \\\"innocent persons\\\" except in the sense that any monetary penalty which is paid out of the union's funds would not be available to be applied to activities which might be thought to advance the interests of members. This will always be the result whenever a union is required to pay a penalty for contempt or a contravention of some statutory provision. It cannot operate as a bar to the imposition of penalties. A court may impose a lower penalty if the offending conduct is carried out by rogue officials and members. Where, as is presently the case, the conduct is that of elected officials who were acting in the course of their duties, the fact that ordinary members of the organisation may, perhaps, be affected by the imposition of a penalty, will weigh far less heavily. If the members are dissatisfied with the conduct of the officers who have engaged in or condoned the offending conduct they may vote against them when they next stand for election. The effect of the contempt on the administration of justice\\n\\nThe CFMEU sought to argue that the contempts did not have a significant adverse effect on the administration of justice. In this context it also relied on its submissions that the Court should have regard to the fact that the objectives of the Order were not circumvented and there was no loss or damage as a result of the contempt. For the reasons outlined above, I either do not accept these submissions or accord them little weight. In addition, the CFMEU contended that it was entitled to rely on the presumption of innocence in relation to the charges laid by the Applicant which were not established and that it was proper for the Court to consider what it described as its \\\"partial compliance\\\" with the Order.\",\"3\":\"The underlying rationale of every exercise of the contempt power is that it is necessary to uphold and protect the effective administration of justice: see Mudginberri Station at 107 (per Gibbs CJ, Mason, Wilson and Deane JJ) . The power to punish contempts serves the purpose of disciplining the defendant and vindicating the authority of the court (see Mudginberri Station at 112-113); it is the means by which the law vindicates the public interest in the due administration of justice: see Attorney-General v Times Newspaper Ltd [1974] AC 273 at 315-316; Borrie & Lowe, The Law of Contempt , (3 rd ed, Butterworths, 1996) p 1 and is the way in which the Court preserves respect for its role and the rule of law: see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Hughes [2001] FCA 38 ; (2001) ATPR 41-807 per Tamberlin J.

Conduct which is calculated to prejudice any of these three requirements or to undermine the public confidence that they will be observed is contempt of court.\\\"\\n\\nThe additional cases relied on by the CFMEU involved contraventions of civil penalty provisions. In those cases it was accepted that the trouble and cost of defending the proceeding served the purpose of personal deterrence. The Full Court in Ponzio v B & P Caeli Constructions Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 65 ; (2007) 158 FCR 543 did not, however, consider that the need for general deterrence would be met unless a monetary penalty was also imposed: see at [97], [164]. In any event and for the reasons earlier articulated, I consider that cases concerning contraventions of civil penalty provisions to be of limited assistance where contempts of court have occurred. In the circumstances of this case deterrence both specific and general is an important consideration. The penalty must be imposed at a meaningful level so as to deter the CFMEU, and others who, save for the risk of a high penalty, may otherwise engage in contravening conduct: see generally Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Info4PC.Com Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 949 ; (2002) 121 FCR 24 at 54; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Hughes [2001] FCA 38 ; (2001) ATPR 41-807 at [24] ; Trade Practices Commission v CSR Ltd [1991] HCA 7 ; [1991] ATPR 52 ,135 (41-076).

Apology or contrition\\n\\nIn my view, the position remains that, where a contemnor has admitted the contempt, genuine contrition and a full and ample apology may reduce the penalty: see, for example, Louis Vuitton Malletier SA v Design Elegance Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 83 ; (2006) 149 FCR 494 at 501; Australian Industry Group v Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing & Kindred Industries Union (2000) 97 IR 474 ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Info4PC.Com Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 949 ; (2002) 121 FCR 24.

In that case the CFMEU was also required to pay indemnity costs: see BHP Steel (AIS) Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining & Energy Union [2002] FCA 702. The CFMEU accepted that prior convictions were relevant and may justify a heavier penalty than might otherwise be imposed. Counsel for the CFMEU told the Court that the CFMEU had not been found guilty of contempt of Court in relation to any earlier action taken in Victoria; the \\\"only potential prior conviction\\\" of the CFMEU was the conviction imposed in the BHP Steel case. It was submitted that \\\"prior convictions of another autonomous division and\\/or autonomous branch of the respondent should not be taken into account\\\". Reliance was placed on Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2006] WASC 317 ; (2006) 164 IR 375 and Temple v Powell [2008] FCA 714 ; (2008) 169 FCR 169. Alternatively, the CFMEU submitted that, if the fine was considered a relevant prior conviction, in the absence of statutory provision, it could not lead to the imposition of a penalty that was disproportionate to the gravity of the instant offence: see Hoare v The Queen [1989] HCA 33 ; (1989) 167 CLR 348 ; Veen v The Queen [1979] HCA 7 ; (1979) 143 CLR 458 and Veen v The Queen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14 ; (1988) 164 CLR 465.\\n\\nIn BHP Steel the CFMEU had contested the charges of contempt at trial but was found guilty: see BHP Steel (AIS) Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining & Energy Union [2000] FCA 1853. While the penalty hearing was pending, the CFMEU appealed. Following the penalty hearing Kiefel J held that, while the lack of an apology is not an aggravating circumstance, the making of an apology can operate to reduce a penalty: see BHP Steel (AIS) Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining & Energy Union [2001] FCA 336. Her Honour ordered that the CFMEU be fined $200,000. On appeal, a Full Court found that the CFMEU was guilty of contempt on a more limited basis than that found by her Honour: see Construction, Forestry, Mining & Energy Union v BHP Steel (AIS) Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1758. The matter was remitted to Kiefel J for reconsideration of the question of penalty. The CFMEU then apologised. It submitted that it had been unable to tender an apology until after the Full Court had determined the extent of its liability: see BHP Steel (AIS) Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2002] FCA 702 at [19] . Her Honour was not re-assured by the apology, but reduced the penalty to $120,000. The CFMEU again appealed.

I have found that the CFMEU thereby committed contempt of Court: see Bovis Lend Lease Pty Ltd v Construction Forestry Mining and Energy Union (2009) 254 ALR 306; [2009] FCA 194. It is now necessary to determine appropriate penalties for these contempts.\\n\\nThe Applicant submitted that the conduct of the CFMEU in this proceeding, (see generally Bovis Lend Lease Pty Ltd v Construction Forestry Mining and Energy Union (2009) 254 ALR 306; [2009] FCA 194 at [23] - [29] , [32]-[33]), was such that the Court could not be confident that the CFMEU would be deterred from engaging in similar conduct in the future unless a significant penalty were imposed. It was accepted by the CFMEU that there was a need for specific and general deterrence where contempts of Court have occurred. Counsel for the CFMEU submitted that the legal expenses which it had incurred in relation to the case constituted a significant deterrent, independently of any monetary penalty which might be imposed. They contended that it was proper for the Court to take into consideration the \\\"significant burden imposed by any costs order against [a] respondent\\\": see BHP Steel at [13] and [53]; and the fact that the defending of the proceeding had involved a cost burden on the CFMEU. The CFMEU's legal costs were said to be $78,000. In support of this contention, the CFMEU also relied on Ponzio v B & P Caelli Construction Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1221 ; Ponzio v B & P Caelli Consturctions Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 65 ; (2007) 158 FCR 543 ; Pine v Expoconti Pty Ltd (2005) 147 IR 426; and Furlong v Maxim Electrical Services (Aust) Pty Ltd (No 3) [2006] FCA 1705.\",\"11\":\"The considerations relevant to the determination of an appropriate penalty for contempt of Court were discussed by the High Court in Mudginberri Station ; see also Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v BHP Steel (AIS) Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 13 ; (2003) 196 ALR 350 (\\\" BHP Steel \\\") and Louis Vuitton Malletier SA v Design Elegance Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 83 ; (2006) 149 FCR 494 at 501-502. Those considerations include:\\n\\nThe CFMEU was determined not to obey the Order and did not make a reasonable attempt to comply with the Order: see Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v BHP Steel (AIS) Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 13 ; (2003) 196 ALR 350 at 358. The conduct of the CFMEU was not casual, accidental or unintentional and was therefore wilful for the purposes of the law of contempt: see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Info4PC.Com Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 949 ; (2002) 121 FCR 24 at 57; Mudginberri Station at 113.\\n\\nIn Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v BHP Steel (AIS) Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 13 ; (2003) 196 ALR 350 Tamberlin and Goldberg JJ (with whom Moore J generally agreed) considered (at 359 [48]) that compliance with the Court's orders by the CFMEU in Queensland was relevant and should have been taken into consideration in assessing the amount of the penalty for the CFMEU's contempt in New South Wales. Their Honours held: \\n \\\"Although constituting only partial compliance, it is a significant step and it does reflect respect for the court's orders and a readiness to comply. The weight to be given to such consideration is of course a matter for the primary judge, but it could not be excluded from consideration as irrelevant or insignificant.\\\" \\n\\nIn the circumstances of that case their Honours considered that the partial compliance had \\\"considerable importance.\\\"\\n\\nThe argument advanced in support of the CFMEU's \\\"partial compliance\\\" claim was that the evidence before the Court was not sufficient to allow the Court to make findings that any additional contraventions had occurred. While the CFMEU is entitled to a presumption of innocence in relation to the charges of contempt that were not established, it does not follow that it is entitled to the benefit of a finding of partial compliance with the Order in relation to this conduct. A lack of evidence to establish a charge does not amount to evidence of partial compliance. There was no evidence of partial compliance. Counsel did not identify any act on the part of CFMEU officials and members who were involved in the picket which constituted partial compliance with any of the orders made by Marshall J. On the contrary the CFMEU may have been liable for further contempts had the charges been framed differently. It may well, for example, have been found guilty of contempt had it been charged with failing forthwith to remove obstructing vehicles upon being served with Marshall J's orders. \\\"Personal\\\" circumstances of the contemnor\\n\\nThe Applicant highlighted the fact that the CFMEU is a large representative body and referred to the following statement on the CFMEU's website: \\n \\\"[The CFMEU is the] largest and most powerful trade union representing construction workers in Australia. It has members on all major building, and most civil construction projects across the country.\\\" \\n\\nThe CFMEU invited the Court to ignore the reference to the website.\\n\\nIn Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v BHP Steel (AIS) Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 13 ; (2003) 196 ALR 350 Tamberlin and Goldberg JJ considered (at 358 [40]), that the fact that contempt had been committed by a large representative body was a relevant consideration in assessing an appropriate penalty: \\n \\\"Generally, it can be said that the adverse impact on the important public interest in the effective administration of justice which results from defiance of a court order or from a failure by a powerful institution or body to comply in a timely manner with an order will generally be more significant than a failure to comply with an order made against a private individual litigant engaged in a personal dispute which does not impact on the community to the same extent. This is a relevant consideration in the present case where the contempt is committed by a large representative body.\\\" \\n\\nI respectfully agree. The CFMEU is a large organisation and it deployed considerable resources in order to maintain the obstruction to an important public hospital development.\\n Means of the CFMEU\\n\\nThe Applicant next referred to the substantial means of the CFMEU. It tendered evidence which showed that as at 31 December 2007, the CFMEU Construction and General Division National Office had net assets of $8,239,524.00 and the Construction and General Division Victorian Divisional Branch recorded net assets of $39,795,785.00. This was not disputed by the CFMEU; nor did it seek to tender any evidence which demonstrated its current financial position. Absence or presence of prior convictions\\n\\nThe question of what, if any, influence awards of costs should have on the determination of penalties for contempt has been considered by a Full Court. In Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v BHP Steel (AIS) Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 13 ; (2003) 196 ALR 350 Moore J held (at 354) that it was appropriate to take into account, when determining the penalty, the significant burden likely to have been imposed by the indemnity costs order of the primary judge. Tamberlin and Goldberg JJ agreed, with reservation (at 360): \\n \\\"In light of the authorities referred to by his Honour [(at 351 353)] we accept that in exercising the wide discretion given as to the amount of any penalty, the consideration that indemnity costs have been awarded is a relevant matter to take into account. Nevertheless, given the underlying principle that disobedience to court orders must be discouraged, in a case such as the present, simply to impose a minimal penalty on the basis that indemnity costs have been ordered may be perceived to downplay the significance of the contempt. The contempt here was public, serious and substantial and the penalty should reflect these matters.\\\"\\n\\nIn BHP Steel the CFMEU had contested the charges of contempt at trial but was found guilty: see BHP Steel (AIS) Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining & Energy Union [2000] FCA 1853. While the penalty hearing was pending, the CFMEU appealed. Following the penalty hearing Kiefel J held that, while the lack of an apology is not an aggravating circumstance, the making of an apology can operate to reduce a penalty: see BHP Steel (AIS) Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining & Energy Union [2001] FCA 336.

Alternatively, the CFMEU submitted that, if the fine was considered a relevant prior conviction, in the absence of statutory provision, it could not lead to the imposition of a penalty that was disproportionate to the gravity of the instant offence: see Hoare v The Queen [1989] HCA 33 ; (1989) 167 CLR 348 ; Veen v The Queen [1979] HCA 7 ; (1979) 143 CLR 458 and Veen v The Queen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14 ; (1988) 164 CLR 465.\\n\\nIn Leighton Le Miere J was called on to determine the appropriate penalty to be imposed on the CFMEU for contraventions of s 38 of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act (Cth) and followed the approach taken by Branson J in Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v Coal and Allied Operations Pty Ltd (No 2) [1999] FCA 1714 ; (1999) 94 IR 231 , which accepted that previous contraventions of Pt XA of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) were a relevant consideration in determining the appropriate penalty for a subsequent contravention of Pt XA of that Act. His Honour continued: \\n \\\"It is not appropriate to consider all contraventions of any industrial legislation by any Branch of the [CFMEU] anywhere in Australia. The [CFMEU] is a very large organisation that operates throughout Australia. Branches, Divisions, officers and representatives of the [CFMEU] are involved in dealings with employers in relation to industrial matters every day. It is inappropriate to take account of conduct of the [CFMEU] through various Branches, Divisions and officers or representatives that is of a different character than the contravening conduct in question and are contraventions of different legislation...\\\" (Emphasis added).\",\"21\":\"As in the proceeding for contempt, Mr N J D Green, of Queen's Counsel, announced that he appeared for the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner (\\\"the ABCC\\\") and sought leave to be heard. Again, Senior Counsel for the CFMEU objected. I indicated that I would hear Mr Green on matters on which only the ABCC was able to assist the Court: see Levy v State of Victoria [1997] HCA 31 ; (1997) 189 CLR 579 at 604-5. He made short oral submissions. Counsel for the ABCC sought to emphasise the matters the ABCC considered the Court should pay regard to when determining the appropriate penalty. These matters largely reflected those emphasised by the parties. As a result, I did not consider that the ABCC was able to assist the Court in dealing with the question of what, if any, penalty should be imposed.\",\"22\":\"The considerations relevant to the determination of an appropriate penalty for contempt of Court were discussed by the High Court in Mudginberri Station ; see also Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v BHP Steel (AIS) Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 13 ; (2003) 196 ALR 350 (\\\" BHP Steel \\\") and Louis Vuitton Malletier SA v Design Elegance Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 83 ; (2006) 149 FCR 494 at 501-502. Those considerations include:\\n\\nIn my view, the position remains that, where a contemnor has admitted the contempt, genuine contrition and a full and ample apology may reduce the penalty: see, for example, Louis Vuitton Malletier SA v Design Elegance Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 83 ; (2006) 149 FCR 494 at 501; Australian Industry Group v Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing & Kindred Industries Union (2000) 97 IR 474 ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Info4PC.Com Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 949 ; (2002) 121 FCR 24. However, where, as here, the charges of contempt are contested, the absence of an apology by the contemnor does not carry any significant weight in the sentencing process.\",\"23\":\"The Court has an unfettered discretion in determining whether and on what basis to award costs: see Oshlack v Richmond River Council [1998] HCA 11 ; (1998) 193 CLR 72 ; Bodruddaza v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2007] HCA 14 ; (2007) 228 CLR 651. It is common for costs to be awarded in favour of a successful Applicant in contempt proceedings: see BHP Steel at 351; Rip Curl International Pty Ltd v Phone Lab Pty Ltd (2004) 63 IPR 496. Courts, however, have awarded costs on a party and party basis (see: for example, Jones v Toben (No 2 ) [2009] FCA 477) and on an indemnity basis (see: for example, BHP Steel (AIS) Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2002] FCA 702). The reason that indemnity costs are frequently awarded where an applicant has successfully prosecuted charges of contempt is that the applicant has not been seeking any remedy on its own behalf but rather has been upholding the various public interests which are served by prosecutions for contempt of Court.\",\"24\":\"The Applicant submitted that the conduct of the CFMEU in this proceeding, (see generally Bovis Lend Lease Pty Ltd v Construction Forestry Mining and Energy Union (2009) 254 ALR 306; [2009] FCA 194 at [23] - [29] , [32]-[33]), was such that the Court could not be confident that the CFMEU would be deterred from engaging in similar conduct in the future unless a significant penalty were imposed. It was accepted by the CFMEU that there was a need for specific and general deterrence where contempts of Court have occurred. Counsel for the CFMEU submitted that the legal expenses which it had incurred in relation to the case constituted a significant deterrent, independently of any monetary penalty which might be imposed. They contended that it was proper for the Court to take into consideration the \\\"significant burden imposed by any costs order against [a] respondent\\\": see BHP Steel at [13] and [53]; and the fact that the defending of the proceeding had involved a cost burden on the CFMEU. The CFMEU's legal costs were said to be $78,000. In support of this contention, the CFMEU also relied on Ponzio v B & P Caelli Construction Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1221 ; Ponzio v B & P Caelli Consturctions Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 65 ; (2007) 158 FCR 543 ; Pine v Expoconti Pty Ltd (2005) 147 IR 426; and Furlong v Maxim Electrical Services (Aust) Pty Ltd (No 3) [2006] FCA 1705.\",\"25\":\"The lack of evidence that any loss and damage was sustained as a result of the CFMEU's misconduct is not a factor which weighs heavily in its favour. The CFMEU relied on Pine v Seelite Windows & Doors Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 500 to support this element of its case. Pine involved contraventions of s 187AA of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) which prohibited an employer from paying an employee during a period when the employee was engaged in industrial action. Four employees were inadvertently paid $656.72, approximately half of which covered the period of industrial action, in breach of s 187AA. Finkelstein J noted that not every contravention of every law needs to be punished and determined not to impose any penalty in the circumstances. His Honour said at [10]: \\n \\\"... No harm has been done to anyone. The contravention was inadvertent. It is unlikely to occur again. The amount of wages involved is insignificant. In these circumstances it would be quite wrong to punish the respondents. Nothing would be achieved by the imposition of a pecuniary penalty. There is no need for a specific deterrent: it is simply not necessary. And if any penalty were imposed it would be so low that it could not act as a general deterrent.\\\"\\n\\nIn my view, this decision does not assist the CFMEU. His Honour was dealing with a trivial and inadvertent breach of a civil penalty provision. He was not concerned with deliberate contemptuous conduct. No issue involving the undermining of the community interest in the effective administration of justice was involved. Moreover, as I have said, a penalty imposed to punish contempt is not designed to compensate for any loss suffered by those affected by the contempt. Such compensation must be sought through other legal avenues. It is usual for the Court to order that a penalty for contempt be paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund not to any party who can establish that it suffered economic loss by reason of the misconduct.\",\"26\":\"The Applicant submitted that the conduct of the CFMEU in this proceeding, (see generally Bovis Lend Lease Pty Ltd v Construction Forestry Mining and Energy Union (2009) 254 ALR 306; [2009] FCA 194 at [23] - [29] , [32]-[33]), was such that the Court could not be confident that the CFMEU would be deterred from engaging in similar conduct in the future unless a significant penalty were imposed.

In those cases it was accepted that the trouble and cost of defending the proceeding served the purpose of personal deterrence. The Full Court in Ponzio v B & P Caeli Constructions Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 65 ; (2007) 158 FCR 543 did not, however, consider that the need for general deterrence would be met unless a monetary penalty was also imposed: see at [97], [164]. In any event and for the reasons earlier articulated, I consider that cases concerning contraventions of civil penalty provisions to be of limited assistance where contempts of court have occurred. In the circumstances of this case deterrence both specific and general is an important consideration. The penalty must be imposed at a meaningful level so as to deter the CFMEU, and others who, save for the risk of a high penalty, may otherwise engage in contravening conduct: see generally Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Info4PC.Com Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 949 ; (2002) 121 FCR 24 at 54; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Hughes [2001] FCA 38 ; (2001) ATPR 41-807 at [24] ; Trade Practices Commission v CSR Ltd [1991] HCA 7 ; [1991] ATPR 52 ,135 (41-076). The fact that a contemnor has incurred legal expenses in defending charges is to be borne in mind when a penalty is determined but this consideration does not weigh heavily in mitigation of penalty. Apology or contrition\",\"28\":\"The CFMEU was also concerned that \\\"the Court should be careful not to impose a penalty misdirected at the members of the respondent.\\\" As I understood this part of its argument it came down to this: union members should not be penalised for the actions of officials over whom they had no control. They would be so penalised if a monetary penalty were to be imposed on the union rather than on the officials and members who had participated in the contemptuous conduct. It was submitted that it was open to the Applicant to name the CFMEU officers involved in the incidents on 19 and 23 February 2009 as respondents to the contempt proceeding. It had chosen not to do so. As a result, so it was contended, any penalty imposed against the CFMEU would penalise innocent persons, the ordinary members of the CFMEU who had not been involved in the conduct, rather than being directed at those who had engaged in the offending conduct: see R v Wattle Gully Goldmines N.L. [1980] VR 622. Payment of the penalties would diminish funds contributed by members which would otherwise have been directed for their benefit.\",\"29\":\"The Court has an unfettered discretion in determining whether and on what basis to award costs: see Oshlack v Richmond River Council [1998] HCA 11 ; (1998) 193 CLR 72 ; Bodruddaza v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2007] HCA 14 ; (2007) 228 CLR 651.

In that case the CFMEU was also required to pay indemnity costs: see BHP Steel (AIS) Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining & Energy Union [2002] FCA 702. The CFMEU accepted that prior convictions were relevant and may justify a heavier penalty than might otherwise be imposed. Counsel for the CFMEU told the Court that the CFMEU had not been found guilty of contempt of Court in relation to any earlier action taken in Victoria; the \\\"only potential prior conviction\\\" of the CFMEU was the conviction imposed in the BHP Steel case.

The power to punish contempts serves the purpose of disciplining the defendant and vindicating the authority of the court (see Mudginberri Station at 112-113); it is the means by which the law vindicates the public interest in the due administration of justice: see Attorney-General v Times Newspaper Ltd [1974] AC 273 at 315-316; Borrie & Lowe, The Law of Contempt , (3 rd ed, Butterworths, 1996) p 1 and is the way in which the Court preserves respect for its role and the rule of law: see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Hughes [2001] FCA 38 ; (2001) ATPR 41-807 per Tamberlin J. There are many facets to the administration of justice (Borrie & Lowe, p 1). While the effect of the contempt on the ability to prosecute the principal proceeding may be relevant in assessing the effect of the contempt on the administration of justice: see, for example, Textile Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia v Morrison Country Clothing Australia Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 1965 , the subject matter of the principal proceeding does not define the scope or the effect of the contempt on the administration of justice. In Attorney-General v Times Newspaper Ltd [1974] AC 273 at 309 Lord Diplock considered the requirements of the due administration of justice: \\n \\\"The due administration of justice requires first that all citizens should have unhindered access to the constitutionally established courts of criminal or civil jurisdiction for the determination of disputes as to their legal rights and liabilities; secondly, that they should be able to rely upon obtaining in the courts the arbitrament of a tribunal which is free from bias against any party and whose decision will be based upon those facts only that have been proved in evidence adduced before it in accordance with the procedure adopted in courts of law; and thirdly that, once the dispute has been submitted to a court of law, they should be able to rely upon there being no usurpation by any other person of the function of that court to decide it according to law. Conduct which is calculated to prejudice any of these three requirements or to undermine the public confidence that they will be observed is contempt of court.\\\"\",\"32\":\"The additional cases relied on by the CFMEU involved contraventions of civil penalty provisions.

They have been rehearsed in a number of the authorities relied on by the CFMEU. These authorities have recently been reviewed by Jessup J in Williams v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 2) [2009] FCA 548.\\n\\nPrior convictions incurred as a result of misconduct by another autonomous division or branch of the CFMEU will not be taken into account where the character of the conduct is different from the conduct in question. This is because of the dissimilarity of the offending conduct and not because of the degree of autonomy accorded to divisions and branches by the CFMEU rules. As Jessup J pointed out in Williams , an earlier offence of the CFMEU is no less an offence by that corporate body because it was committed by a division or branch other than the one responsible for the offence presently under consideration. Moreover, as his Honour observed, \\\"the deterrent effect of a penalty would be significantly compromised if the court were obliged to turn a blind eye to a prior contravention merely because it occurred in a different division or branch of an organisation\\\": at [20].\\n\\nBoth BHP Steel and the present case involved contempts of Court, occasioned by the breaching of an injunctive order. I consider that the conviction in BHP Steel is a relevant prior conviction. Public nature of the defiance\",\"36\":\"The public interest in the administration of justice requires compliance with all orders and undertakings: see Witham v Holloway (1995) 183 CLR 525 at 532-533. In Witham the High Court said (at 533): \\n \\\"All orders, whether they be Mareva injunctions, injunctions relating to the subject matter of the suit, or, simply, procedural orders, are made in the interests of justice. Non-compliance necessarily constitutes an interference with the administration of justice even if the position can be remedied as between the parties.\\\"\\n\\nThe submission that the penalty imposed ought to reflect the fact that the objectives of the Order, as perceived by the CFMEU, were not circumvented is misconceived. In my view, it reflects the cavalier attitude taken by the CFMEU to the Order and the Court, and misconstrues the objective of the Order. The Order prohibited the CFMEU, whether by itself, its officers, servants, agents or howsoever otherwise from doing any act, or directing, advising or authorising, or doing or continuing any act to aid, abet, counsel, procure, encourage or induce any person to obstruct or interfere with the passage of any person, whether on foot or in a vehicle proceeding into or from the Site. The immediate purpose of the Order was to ensure that access to the Site by persons and vehicles should not be impeded. The Order was ignored. CFMEU officials and members were responsible on two occasions for obstructing the passage of vehicles which could otherwise have entered the Site. It was purely fortuitous (if it be the case) that the impugned conduct did not disrupt work on the Site\\n\\nIt is no answer to say that the contempt was constituted by omissions or to seek to diminish the gravity of the contempt by relying on the conduct of the drivers of the obstructed vehicles. Furthermore, the claim that the offending conduct was constituted by omissions cannot be accepted. CFMEU officials parked union-owned vehicles across the entrance to the Site. From time to time vehicles were removed and replaced by other vehicles. A tent or marquee was erected in such a position as to prevent the opening of one of the gates. The only sense in which the conduct of the officials and members might properly be characterised as involving omissions is that it included the failures and refusals to move the obstructions when requested to do so by representatives of the Applicant and as required by the Order.\"}}"
