The appellant's main claim before the Tribunal was to a well-founded fear of persecution because he was a member of the Bihari community in Bangladesh. Although there was no direct claim of persecution for political opinion, that is not the end of the matter. A claim ' not expressly advanced will attract the review obligation of the Tribunal when it is apparent on the face of the material before the Tribunal ' ( NABE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2004] FCAFC 263 ; (2004) 144 FCR 1 at [58] ).\\n\\n13 In short, the appellant did not raise matters to the Tribunal which articulated or raised a claim to persecution based on political opinion. No such claim was expressly made nor did it arise clearly on the material before the Tribunal ( NABE at [60]). There was no error on the part of the Tribunal in failing to consider such a claim. The Tribunal dealt with the matters raised by the appellant in the context of the claim made by him to the Tribunal. Not only was the Tribunal unaware that such a claim arose from the factual matters raised by the appellant, but so also was counsel who appeared before the Federal Magistrate and her Honour.\\n\\n14 The appellant told the Tribunal that if he returns to Bangladesh the hooligans will try to kill him. He also said that Biharis have no human rights in Bangladesh and no protection. However, he made no claim that he had sought protection from any person. The Tribunal expressed some doubts about whether the appellant had confrontations with the hooligans, but accepted that he had objected to their illegal activities within the camp. The Tribunal expressed the view that if they had wished to harm the appellant they would have already done so. The appellant claimed no harm to himself.\\n\\n15 The appellant does not challenge the Tribunal's factual conclusions but contends that the Tribunal was obliged to and did not consider whether the appellant had a well-founded fear of persecution on return to Bangladesh. Mr Karp, who appears for the appellant, pointed to matters such as the sincerity of the opinion held by the appellant and whether he would be expected to re-engage in his activities on his return to Bangladesh. However, the Tribunal concluded that there was nothing in the evidence to indicate that the appellant has suffered treatment amounting to persecution in the past and nothing in the evidence to indicate that there is a real chance that the appellant would face treatment amounting to persecution if he returns to Bangladesh.\",\"4\":\"7 The Tribunal was not obliged to make the case for the appellant ( Saliba v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1998) 89 FCR 38 at 50).

I accept that there is no detriment to the first respondent other than costs and that the potential consequences to the appellant are serious. I also take into account the integrity of the appellate process as discussed in VAAC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 74 ; (2003) 129 FCR 168 at [23] and [24].\\n\\n18 There is, in my view, little or no prospect of the proposed ground of appeal succeeding for the reasons I have given. Accordingly, the application for leave to file the amended notice of appeal is refused. There being no other ground of appeal pressed it also follows that the appeal is dismissed.
