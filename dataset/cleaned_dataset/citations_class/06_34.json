On 7 September 2004, I published reasons for judgment on liability: Willis Tu v Pakway Australia Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1151 (\\\" Willis Tu \\\"). I found that the first and second respondents had infringed the registered designs. The applicants elected to have an account of profits and, by agreement, the parties subsequently settled on $36,728 as the amount of profit. The parties were, however, unable to agree on costs and have filed submissions concerning a number of costs questions. The question of costs now falls for determination.\\n\\n2 The respondents concede that the applicants are entitled to a general order for costs in their favour. However, they submit that they are entitled to costs that were reserved in connection with the application for an interlocutory injunction and the notice of motion filed on 13 February 2002. The respondents also claim that the applicants should not recover costs relating to affidavits of Robin Walton, the evidence of Peter Kingsley Bayly, and the retention of two counsel for trial.\\n\\n3 The applicants submit that there is no reason to depart from, or modify, the application of the general rule that costs follow the event. Moreover, they submit that the Court should order that costs not be reduced by one-third pursuant to O 62 r 36A(1) of the Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth) (\\\"the Rules\\\").\\n\\n18 The affidavits of Robin Walton and the evidence of Peter Bayly, to the extent admissible, did not much advance the applicants' case: see Willis Tu at [90]. Nevertheless, Mr Bayly's evidence assisted the Court in identifying the significant features of the registered designs: see Willis Tu at [91]-[94]. In the circumstances of the case, I do not find the applicants' reliance on his evidence as so unreasonable as to justify denying him the costs of this evidence. Similarly, I would not disallow the applicants the costs of Mr Walton's affidavits simply because these affidavits included some unnecessary technical details and the applicants did not succeed on the issues to which they were directed.\\n\\n19 Accordingly, the applicants should recover the costs relating to the affidavits of Mr Walton and the evidence of Mr Bayly.\\n\\n20 Finally, the respondents contended that the applicants should not recover the costs of retaining senior and junior counsel. This is an issue that is properly raised before a taxing officer, although I deal with it here as a matter of expediency.\",\"1\":\"4 The power of the Court to make orders for costs derives from s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).

In that case, the applicant sought injunctive relief against the respondents to restrain them from selling a fishing lure under a name similar to the name under which the applicant manufactured and sold its lure. It was alleged that the respondents' conduct involved conduct that was misleading or deceptive contrary to s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth). The matter was resolved through consent orders granting such injunctive relief and damages of $4,200. Mansfield J ordered that costs be reduced by one third pursuant to O 62 r 36A(1) even though the applicant had secured the injunctive relief.\\n\\n29 As already indicated, in reply, the applicants noted that Reidy's Lures involved a different kind of cause of action (conduct in contravention of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth)) than this matter.

In contrast, in the applicants' submission, this case, which involved an attack on validity, was far more complex.\\n\\n31 Although not on all fours with this case, Metro on George is more apposite than Reidy's Lures . As the applicants noted, Reidy's Lures involved a different cause of action, was very simple (the respondents were manufacturing and selling a lure under a name that was almost identical to that of the applicant) and involved no contest of validity. Its simplicity is reflected in the fact that, in marked contrast to this matter, it was settled quickly by consent orders. Moreover, the damages awarded in Reidy's Lures were very small indeed. For reasons similar to those canvassed in Metro on George , I find that it would not be appropriate to reduce the costs recovered in this case.\",\"19\":\"30 The Court has a discretion to order that O 62 r 36A(1) not be applied.

In Metro on George , Bennett J treated the fact that the litigation was complex and the injunctive relief of more importance to the parties than the quantum of damages as a proper basis on which to order that the reduction under O 62 r 36A(1) should not be made.\\n\\n31 Although not on all fours with this case, Metro on George is more apposite than Reidy's Lures . As the applicants noted, Reidy's Lures involved a different cause of action, was very simple (the respondents were manufacturing and selling a lure under a name that was almost identical to that of the applicant) and involved no contest of validity. Its simplicity is reflected in the fact that, in marked contrast to this matter, it was settled quickly by consent orders. Moreover, the damages awarded in Reidy's Lures were very small indeed. For reasons similar to those canvassed in Metro on George , I find that it would not be appropriate to reduce the costs recovered in this case.\",\"20\":\"30 The Court has a discretion to order that O 62 r 36A(1) not be applied.
