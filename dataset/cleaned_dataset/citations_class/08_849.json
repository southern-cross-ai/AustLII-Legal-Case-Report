For example, allegations of actual bias may require evidence relating to extraneous matters going far beyond the material before the decision maker. Claims of improper purpose typically present evidentiary difficulties. The Court must determine, in cases of that type, whether a stated purpose was in fact the real purpose. Such claims often fail for lack of sufficient evidence. On occasion, however, documents obtained on discovery and answers to interrogatories can provide evidence of motive or purpose and, accordingly, may be of relevance. See, for example, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Wong at [26].\",\"7\":\"23 The respondents accept that discrimination without apparent justification has, in some circumstances, been held to constitute Wednesbury unreasonableness: Fares Rural Meat and Livestock Co Pty Ltd v Australian Meat and Live-Stock Corporation [1990] FCA 139 ; (1990) 96 ALR 153. They say, however, that the Minister's exercise of power under s 77EA(1) is not susceptible to review purely because different Ministers have acted differently in the past in relation to similar imported goods.\\n\\n24 The respondents also say that the Minister is under no obligation to consider whether to exercise his power under s 77EA in relation to all goods that are imported. The power is one that involves ordering Customs to detain goods if the Minister considers that it is in the public interest to do so. There is no requirement under the section that Customs inform the Minister of any particular situations in which he or she may potentially exercise the power, still less any requirement that the Minister initiate investigations into all such cases. Accordingly, so it is submitted, it cannot be inferred, even on the basis of apparently unequal treatment, that there has been unlawful discrimination.\",\"8\":\"25 The respondents observe that the power conferred under s 77EA is necessarily very broad.

It follows that O 11 r 16 of the Rules, which enables the Court to order that the whole or any part of a pleading be struck out, has no direct application to this case. Nonetheless, the authorities that deal with that order can be invoked, by analogy, in relation to grounds specified in an application under the ADJR Act : Whim Creek Consolidated NL v Colgan [1989] FCA 261 ; (1989) 25 FCR 50.\",\"12\":\"34 The Court will always be slow to exercise its discretion to strike out a pleading: Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62 and General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125.

The onus of satisfying the Court that this criterion is met lies upon the party alleging that to be the case.\\n\\n35 Any proceeding commenced on or after 1 December 2005 is subject to s 31A(2) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), as well as O 20 r 5 of the Rules. Section 31A provides that the Court may give summary judgment in favour of one party against another if, inter alia, it is satisfied that the other party \\\"has no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding or that part of the proceeding\\\". For the purposes of the section, a proceeding, or part of a proceeding, need not be hopeless or bound to fail for it to have no reasonable prospect of success. The section is concerned with the bringing and defending of proceedings, and not just with pleadings. It seems clear that the section is intended to relax the test imposed by General Steel as to the circumstances in which a proceeding may be struck out.\\n\\n37 The respondents did not at any stage seek to invoke s 31A. For that reason, I propose to hold them to the higher, General Steel standard insofar as they seek to strike out the grounds of review that they have identified. I do so without expressing any final opinion as to whether s 31A would, in fact, have been available to them had they sought to rely upon it.\\n\\n38 To the extent that the applicant's case against the respondents depends upon nothing more than its claim that the current Minister is approaching the question of \\\"public interest\\\" in a different manner to his predecessor, it is untenable.\\n\\n39 The Minister's predecessor may have taken a more benign view of the importation of weapons of this type. If he did, that still cannot form the basis of a conclusion that the Minister's decision in this case was unreasonable. The requirement in s 77EA that the Minister base his decision upon \\\"the public interest\\\" confers upon him a broad and multi-faceted discretion. Reasonable minds are likely to differ as to what that term entails. If the Minister's decision is, ultimately, held to be unreasonable in the Wednesbury sense, it will be because it was wholly irrational and not because his predecessor did not share this Minister's views.\\n\\n40 It follows that I would be minded to strike out the grounds of review, and the particulars in support thereof, that depend entirely upon reasoning of the type just discussed. I say that in the context of an interlocutory application brought for the sole purpose of obtaining leave to deliver interrogatories aimed at assembling evidence to support a factual finding that leads nowhere in a legal sense. As I will not be hearing this matter when it comes before the Court for final determination, it is sufficient for me to do no more than refuse the application for leave to deliver those interrogatories that relate to the period prior to 6 December 2007 without, at this stage, proceeding to strike out the grounds of review that I regard as untenable.\\n\\n41 The position regarding the period after 6 December 2007 is more difficult. At a theoretical level, there might be a case in which it could be shown that the Minister has discriminated against the applicant, singling it out for adverse treatment and ignoring the acts of its competitors. Such conduct on the part of the Minister might be amenable to judicial review, if not under the ADJR Act , then certainly pursuant to s 39B.\",\"14\":\"34 The Court will always be slow to exercise its discretion to strike out a pleading: Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62 and General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125.

The section permits judgment to be given in favour of one party against another only, and does not address grounds of review as such: see Fortron Automotive Treatments Pty Ltd v Jones (No 2) [2006] FCA 1401. Order 54 r 7(1)(a) of the Rules, which governs applications brought under the ADJR Act , provides that a party may apply to the Court for \\\"judgment\\\" in an application for an order for review under O 20 r 2 or s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act . Order 54 r 7(1)(b) enables a party to apply to have an application for an order of review stayed or dismissed under O 20 r 4 or r 5. It follows that the Court can dismiss a \\\"claim for relief\\\" in a particular proceeding if that claim constitutes an abuse of process.\",\"16\":\"9 In Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Wong [2002] FCAFC 327 , a Full Court of the Federal Court, while not determining whether the Court had power generally to order interrogatories to be answered in judicial review proceedings, said that it saw no reason \\\"why there should be a differentiation in Australia between the power to order discovery and the power to order that interrogatories be answered\\\".\\n\\n46 To grant leave to interrogate in the circumstances presented here would be to encourage not merely \\\"fishing\\\" but full-scale \\\"trawling\\\".

For a time, there developed a body of case law in this country involving challenges to the validity of search warrants, essentially on the basis that they had been improperly obtained. The principle seems to have been that a warrant obtained by a half-truth should be set aside. See generally the authorities collected and discussed by Aronson, Dyer and Groves \\\" Judicial Review of Administrative Action \\\" (3rd ed, 2004, at 302, fn 339). In some of these cases, far-ranging discovery was ordered and informative documents obtained. Interestingly, however, attempts to deliver interrogatories were generally unsuccessful: see, for example, Grofam Pty Ltd v Macauley (1993) 43 FCR 404 , where leave to serve interrogatories on a magistrate who had issued a search warrant was refused.\\n\\n50 The only grounds of review that could even conceivably support the grant of leave to deliver interrogatories in this case are those alleging discrimination on the part of this Minister when he decided to have the applicant's weapons detained, based upon his later treatment of its competitors. These are ground 7(d) in support of the ADJR Act application and ground 8(e) in support of the s 39B(1A)(c) application. However, as discussed above, those grounds are largely speculative. They do not warrant the grant of leave to interrogate.\\n\\n51 It follows that I need not determine whether, as the respondents contend, it would be unduly burdensome for them to be required to answer the proposed interrogatories. The applicant has failed to establish any adequate basis for their delivery. The grounds of review to which they are directed are untenable.\\n\\n I certify that the preceding fifty-one (51) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Weinberg. \\n\\n\\n Associate:\\n\\nDated: 6 June 2008\\n\\n Counsel for the Applicant: Mr T.
