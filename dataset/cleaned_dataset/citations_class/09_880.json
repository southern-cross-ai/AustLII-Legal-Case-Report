The legislative intention may, perhaps, be more easily seen ... where the statutory definition adds to or subtracts from what, apart from the definition, would be the meaning of the particular word in the statutory command: see, eg, R v Brewer [1942] HCA 33 ; (1942) 66 CLR 535 ; YZ Finance Co Pty Ltd v Cummings [1964] HCA 12 ; (1964) 109 CLR 395.\\n\\nAided by the 1999 Memorandum, I have determined that the entity referred to in s 152-30(2)(a) as \\\"the other entity\\\" does not include a partnership. Since s 152-30 defines when one entity is connected to another for the purposes of s 152-15(a)(ii), a partnership is not an \\\"entity\\\" for the purposes of par (a)(ii). It follows from the determination that a partnership is not an entity for the purpose of those provisions, that it was not the intention of the legislature that par (d) of the definition of \\\"entity\\\" in s 960-100 should apply to those provisions. Accordingly a contrary intention appears for the purposes of s 995.\\n\\nI answer the preliminary question: \\n Is a partnership an \\\"entity\\\" within the meaning of that term as used in s 152-15(a)(ii) of the Act? \\n\\n \\n No. \\n\\n I certify that the preceding fifty-five (55) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Sundberg. \\n \\n Associate:\\n \\n \\nDated: 18 August 2009\\n \\n Counsel for the Applicant: F O'Loughlin \\n \\n Solicitor for the Applicant: Hall & Wilcox \\n \\n Counsel for the Respondent: A Broadfoot \\n \\n Solicitor for the Respondent: Gadens Lawyers \\n Date of Hearing: 28 July 2009 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 18 August 2009 \\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2009\\/880.html\"}}"
