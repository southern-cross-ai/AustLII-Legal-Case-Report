While that does not limit the prospective use of a label of this nature, I infer from the absence of such evidence that such use would not be in the fair and normal course: Woollen Mills at 658, Woolworths Metro at [49] and All-Fect at [41]. In my view, the hypothetical scenario that the applicant proffers is one that will not, in all likelihood, eventuate. It cannot, therefore, lead to consumer confusion for the purposes of the Act. However, to cover this hypothetical case, the Court's order will state that bourbon in the statement of goods does not include bourbon which is labelled only as 'whiskey' or 'whisky'.\\n\\n71 The relevant surrounding circumstances provide additional reasons why there would be marginal (if any) confusion. Carelessness or stupidity are considerations to be disregarded in any comparative analysis. This consideration has greater weight in a market where the purchase of products is not one of impulse, but requires some degree of consideration. Unlike All-Fect , this case does not deal with confectionary that targets consumers of less discerning habits, such as children. A purchaser must be at least 18 years of age and would, in all likelihood, consider the second feature of the marks. There is no deceptive similarity between the marks.\\n\\n72 Similarly here, the point of difference is the second element of both marks: OAKS and LIVET. What appears at [71] to [72] is equally applicable in this comparison. OAKS and LIVIT do not hold the same meaning, the marks are vastly different in a visual and aural sense.\\n\\n73 There is no deceptive similarity between the GLENN OAKS and GLENMORANGIE marks. Again, the second feature in the marks is distinct both visually and aurally. It is this feature that the consumer would be drawn to in terms of identifying a difference between the brands. Even allowing for imperfect recollection, there is no deceptive similarity between the marks.\",\"12\":\"55 Customers are not to be credited with any \\\"high perception or habitual caution\\\".

An attempt should be made to estimate the effect or impression produced on the mind of potential customers by the mark or device for which the protection of an injunction is sought. The impression or recollection which is carried away and retained is necessarily the basis of any mistaken belief that the challenged mark or device is the same. The effect of spoken description must be considered. If a mark is in fact or from its nature likely to be the source of some name or verbal description by which buyers will express their desire to have the goods, then similarities both of sound and of meaning play an important part. The usual manner in which ordinary people behave must be the test of what confusion or deception may be expected. Potential buyers of goods are not to be credited with any high perception or habitual caution. On the other hand, exceptional carelessness or stupidity may be disregarded. The course of business and the way in which the particular class of goods are sold gives, it may be said, the setting, and the habits and observation of men considered in the mass affords the standard.

Most uninvolved scotch whisky consumers, particularly those of pre-mixed drinks, would also think of a person's name before thinking of a Scottish place. The LMMA Report indicates that scotch whisky drinkers prefer pre-mixed drinks. There was no evidence of any pre-mixed drinks with the name Glen or Glenn. Involved scotch whisky consumers are in the same position. Consumers in the involved malt whisky class are discerning in their choice and are very knowledgeable about the products they purchase. Purchasing habits are more refined, which lessens the chance of confusion. Glen or Glenn, as a person's name, overshadows the connotation propounded by the applicant. Accordingly, that connotation is not strong enough to cause \\\"enough persons in the relevant public to be deceived or confused\\\": Carlton & United Breweries v Royal Crown (2001) 53 IPR 599 at 606; The Kendall Co v Mulsyn Paint and Chemicals ( Kendall ) [1963] HCA 1 ; (1963) 109 CLR 300 at 305.\",\"19\":\"59 First, for both involved and uninvolved purchasers of bourbon products, the words Glen or Glenn is more likely to be associated with a person's name than with a place denoting Scottish origin. Most uninvolved scotch whisky consumers, particularly those of pre-mixed drinks, would also think of a person's name before thinking of a Scottish place. The LMMA Report indicates that scotch whisky drinkers prefer pre-mixed drinks. There was no evidence of any pre-mixed drinks with the name Glen or Glenn.

This is the fair and normal way in which consumers behave. In this case, confusion is mitigated by the circumstances in which such products are bought and sold. Bourbon products are typically labelled as bourbon, bourbon whiskey or Tennessee whiskey. Importantly, a consumer of these products must be 18 years of age. Bourbon products are much more expensive than impulse products such as soft drinks and confectionary: cf. All-Fect at [41] and Shanahan's Australian Law of Trade Marks & Passing Off 3 rd ed (Shanahan), 176 and 211-212. Purchasers of alcohol generally tend to be discerning in their purchasing habits: cf Henschke & Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd ( Henschke ) (2001) 52 IPR 42 and Shanahan at 211-212. Where goods are denoted as being from a particular country, this constitutes another factor that reduces the possibility of confusion: Green's Application (1946) 64 RPC 14.\",\"21\":\"66 The key issue under s 60 is a comparison between the GLENN OAKS mark and marks used before its priority date. The approach in Pianotist Co's Application (1906) 23 RPC 774 at 777 is oft cited. There, Parker J said:\\n \\n \\\"You must take the two words. You must judge of them, both by their look and by their sound. You must consider the goods to which they are applied. You must consider the nature and kind of customer who would be likely to buy those goods. In fact, you must consider all of the surrounding circumstances; and you must further consider what is likely to happen if each of those trade marks are used in a normal way as a trade mark for the goods of the respective owners of the marks.\\\"\\n\\n80 Beck Koller at 83 indicates that family marks are only to be regarded as one of the \\\"surrounding circumstances which is required to be taken into account\\\" when making a comparison. Pianotist , as approved in High Court authorities, remains the primary test of deceptive similarity. Therefore, the existence of family marks is only a relevant factor in the totality of the assessment of whether there is a likelihood of deception or confusion. In this case, it supports the respondent.\",\"22\":\"67 That passage was cited with approval in Cooper Engineering Co. Pty Ltd v Sigmund Pumps Limited [1952] HCA 15 ; (1952) 86 CLR 536 at 538 and in Woollen Mills at 658, where Dixon and McTiernan JJ described the comparative analysis as follows:\\n \\n \\\"In deciding this question, the marks ought not, of course, to be compared side by side. An attempt should be made to estimate the effect or impression produced on the mind of potential customers by the mark or device for which the protection of an injunction is sought. The impression or recollection which is carried away and retained is necessarily the basis of any mistaken belief that the challenged mark or device is the same. The effect of spoken description must be considered. If a mark is in fact or from its nature likely to be the source of some name or verbal description by which buyers will express their desire to have the goods, then similarities both of sound and of meaning play an important part. The usual manner in which ordinary people behave must be the test of what confusion or deception may be expected. Potential buyers of goods are not to be credited with any high perception or habitual caution. On the other hand, exceptional carelessness or stupidity may be disregarded. The course of business and the way in which the particular class of goods are sold gives, it may be said, the setting, and the habits and observation of men considered in the mass affords the standard. Evidence of actual cases of deception, if forthcoming, is of great weight.\\\"\",\"23\":\"\",\"24\":\"54 In Coca-Cola Co v All-Fect Distributors Ltd (All-Fect) (1998) 43 IPR 47 at [41], albeit an infringement case, the Full Court said:\\n \\n \\\"...the likelihood of deception or confusion involves an assessment of what would be the probable visual impression on customers or potential customers which would be produced as a result of the \\\"notional normal and fair use\\\" of the marks.

The applicant relied upon a Trade Mark Office decision in McDonalds Corporation v Bellamy (2004) 62 IPR 133 at 139 to support the submission. There, the delegate said:\\n \\n \\\"[In] the line of 'family' trade mark cases...the trade marks of an opponent have been found to have a common element, usually a prefix, which is so thoroughly associated with the opponent's goods or services that the use by another person of a trade mark incorporating that element, would deceive or confuse.\\\"\\n\\n78 In both Woolworths Metro and McDonalds there was only one registered owner of the relevant trade marks. Several United States authorities, including J & J Snack Foods Corp v McDonald's Corp 932 F2d 1460 (Fed Cir 1991) and American Standard Inc v Scott & Fetzer Co 200 USPQ 457 461 (TTAB 1978), support the distinction referred to at [77]-[78].\",\"27\":\"76 The family marks argument is not persuasive. The applicant is not the registered owner of all the 'Glen' marks. Beck Koller & Co (1947) 64 RPC 76 at 83 provides guidance, in dicta, as to how family marks should be examined:\\n \\n \\\"When an application for registration is before the Registrar, it frequently happens that the search for conflicting marks reveals several marks having some characteristic feature in common with the mark of the application, which marks may stand on the register in the name of one proprietor only, or in the name of several different proprietors. \\n ... \\n If, therefore, all the marks were owned by one proprietor, the Registrar would presume that the latter was using a 'series' of marks and judge the conflict between the applicants' mark and each of the proprietor's mark with this consideration in mind. \\n ... \\n On the other hand, if the registered marks were owned by several different proprietors, this would be a circumstance which might considerably assist the applicant who would be in a position to submit that the common characteristic was one well recognised in marks in use in the particular trade. In short, when the Registrar comes to compare the applicant's mark with the registered marks, ... the presence of marks on the register other than the one with which the comparison is being made is regarded as one of the surrounding circumstances which he is required to take into account. \\\" \\n (Emphasis added)\\n\\n77 The \\\"applicant\\\" referred to in that passage is the applicant for the trade mark. So if the marks were owned by the same party, that would have gone against the applicant, but where there were a number of prior registered marks belonging to different parties, that was in the applicant's favour. In the present case, the respondent is the applicant for the trade mark. The passage above cuts in favour of the GLENN OAKS mark.\\n\\n80 Beck Koller at 83 indicates that family marks are only to be regarded as one of the \\\"surrounding circumstances which is required to be taken into account\\\" when making a comparison.

The function of a trade mark is to indicate the origin of the goods: Powell's Trade Mark (1893) 10 RPC 195 at 200. If the evidence establishes a common characteristic well recognised in marks in use by different owners in the particular trade (for example 'Glen'), this would reduce the chance of confusion as the consumer is aware that different owners maintain different trade marks (albeit names starting with the same word or letters). The consumer's attention is, therefore, likely to be more attuned to the second element in the relevant mark. For example OAKS in GLENN OAKS or LIVET in GLENLIVET. In particular, awareness of the second element would be a matter of habit for involved scotch whisky consumers.\",\"31\":\"84 Passing off is a tort that does not require proof of intent to deceive. However, there must be at least a likelihood of deception: Erven Warnink BV v J Townsend & Sons Hull Ltd [1980] RPC 31 at [93] and [99]. For the reasons given in dealing with the earlier grounds, that has not been established.\\n\\n85 The application must be dismissed.\\n\\n86 The delegate said that the applicant's opposition was justified. The applicant was correct in saying that use of the mark on the goods for which the application was accepted was likely to cause confusion. On the other hand the respondent's amendment to his statement of goods following the hearing was sufficient to eliminate that likelihood. As both parties thus had a measure of success, the delegate considered they should bear their own costs. That is also the view to which I have come.
