There is nothing in that case that suggests that the decisions in M38\\/2002 and NATB are not correct.\\n\\nApplying these factors to the factual reference of 'reasonable practicability' in s 198(6) of the Migration Act I have reached the conclusion that it is not a jurisdictional fact. It is true that two of the factors suggest that it should be characterised as a jurisdictional fact, but the other two factors speak so strongly against it being a jurisdictional fact that the first two factors are clearly outweighed. Weighing in favour of the factual reference being a jurisdictional fact is that there is no reference to the officer's 'opinion', 'belief' or 'satisfaction' in s 198(6) of the Act, although (as Gummow J noted in Al-Kateb at 608 [121]) the use of the word 'reasonably' suggests that there is an element of judgment or assessment in the criterion. Also weighing in favour of the factual reference being a jurisdictional fact is that important interests of the unlawful non-citizen are at stake, although it must be remembered that those interests are at most concerned with the applicant's detention prior to his eventual deportation and the timing of that deportation, rather than any actual right to remain in Australia. On the other hand, the nature of the task may be a difficult and complex one and may involve a wide range of considerations; indeed, it may be impossible to come to any conclusion without a detailed consideration of a great deal of information, much of it of a political or diplomatic character. Whilst a Court may have little difficulty determining the unlawful non-citizen's fitness to travel it would be ill-equipped to consider other matters such as conditions in other countries. Furthermore, circumstances may change very quickly and require constant monitoring. A decision that the factual reference is a jurisdictional fact would produce considerable inconvenience because it would mean that an officer's decision that removal was reasonably practicable would be provisional until upheld by a Court in a context where circumstances may change very quickly.\\n\\nThe applicant referred to the decision of Al-Kateb in this context, but in my opinion there is nothing in that case which suggests that the question of reasonable practicability is a jurisdictional fact. It is true that certain Justices of the High Court considered what was encompassed by the phrase 'reasonable practicability'; Gummow J at 608 [121]; Hayne J at 639 [227]; Callinan J at 658-662 [290]-[299] but the Court did not address the question of whether reasonable practicability was a jurisdictional fact. Although his Honour was concerned with different questions to those arising before me, in my respectful opinion the High Court's treatment of the phrase was accurately summarised by French J in WAJZ at [83]-[85].\",\"1\":\"In my opinion, the question of reasonable practicability is not a jurisdictional fact. The question is whether 'reasonable practicability' is to be finally determined by the officer or only provisionally determined by him or her and finally determined by the Court. As I understand the authorities, that question is ultimately one of statutory consideration. The authorities have identified a number of relevant considerations: \\n \\n 1. If the factual reference (as it is sometimes called) is expressed in terms of the 'opinion', 'belief' or satisfaction' of the primary decision-maker then the factual reference is not a jurisdictional fact, although there will still be a jurisdictional fact, namely, the primary decision-maker's state of mind. The contrary does not follow, in that the absence of reference to 'opinion', 'belief' or 'satisfaction' of the decision-maker does not mean the factual reference is a jurisdictional fact (Aronson, Dyer and Groves, Judicial Review of Administrative Action (3 rd ed, 2000) pages 227-239).\\n 2. The nature of the task is important. If the task is a difficult and complex one involving an assessment of complex facts and the forming of opinions on a wide range of matters then that suggests that the factual reference is not a jurisdictional fact because it is considered that Parliament intended that the decision be made by the primary decision-maker: Australian Heritage Commission v Mount Isa Mines Ltd (1995) 60 FCR 456 per Black CJ at 465-466 (High Court: Australian Heritage Commission v Mount Isa Mines Ltd [1997] HCA 10 ; (1997) 187 CLR 297); Cabal v Attorney-General of the Commonwealth [2001] FCA 583 ; (2001) 113 FCR 154.\\n 3. If inconvenience results from holding that a factual reference is a jurisdictional fact then that will be considered a reason not to hold that it is a jurisdictional fact: Parisienne Basket Shoes Pty Ltd v Whyte [1938] HCA 7 ; (1938) 59 CLR 369; Australian Heritage Commission v Mount Isa Mines Ltd (1995) 60 FCR 456 per Black CJ at 465-466; Cabal v Attorney-General of the Commonwealth (supra) per Weinberg J at 173 [74]. With respect, the clearest statement of the principle remains that of Dixon J (as he then was) in Parisienne Basket Shoes Pty Ltd v Whyte (supra) (at 391):\\n 'It cannot be denied that, if the legislature see fit to do it, any event or fact or circumstance whatever may be made a condition upon the occurrence or existence of which the jurisdiction of a court shall depend. But, if the legislature does make the jurisdiction of a court contingent upon the actual existence of a state of facts, as distinguished from the court's opinion or determination that the facts do exist, then the validity of the proceedings and orders must always remain an outstanding question until some other court or tribunal, possessing power to determine that question, decides that the requisite state of facts in truth existed and the proceedings of the court were valid. Conceding the abstract possibility of the legislature adopting such a course, nevertheless it produces so inconvenient a result that no enactment dealing with proceedings in any of the ordinary courts of justice should receive such an interpretation unless the intention is clearly expressed.' \\n \\n 4. The importance of the decision in terms of the nature of the rights affected by it is a matter to be taken into account. If the rights at stake are fundamental or important rights then that may suggest that the factual reference is a jurisdictional fact: Buck v Comcare (1996) 66 FCR 359 per Finn J at 364.\",\"2\":\"In my opinion, the question of reasonable practicability is not a jurisdictional fact.

The matters in paragraphs (a)-(d) inclusive must occur or arise before the duty arises. Furthermore, the duty is not absolute in the sense that thereafter it only arises as soon as it is reasonably practicable to remove the unlawful non-citizen. The Court noted that in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Al Masri [2003] FCAFC 70 ; (2003) 126 FCR 54 the Full Court of this Court said that there was no duty to remove an unlawful non-citizen when removal was not reasonably practicable. The Court in M38\\/2002 considered the meaning of the words 'reasonably practicable' and noted various dictionary definitions and statements made in the authorities. The Court expressed the view that whether the removal of an unlawful non-citizen is practicable 'seems to be largely, if not entirely, concerned with whether the removal is possible from the officer's viewpoint' (at 165[65]). The Court expressed the view that the removal of a non-citizen may be practicable in the sense of feasible, but not 'reasonably practicable' as required by s 198(6) of the Act. The Court expressed the view that practicability and reasonableness may, on occasions, operate in opposing senses. The Court identified as matters an officer may taken into account in determining whether it is reasonably practicable to remove an unlawful non-citizen matters such as whether another country will admit the person, whether it can admit the person and the physical condition of a person facing removal (at 166[69]). There is no reason not to include in this list of matters, the mental condition of a person facing removal.\\n\\nIn M38\\/2002 the Court said that in determining when it was reasonably practicable to remove an unlawful non-citizen it is not open to an officer to consider whether an unlawful non-citizen is a 'refugee' within the meaning of Art 1A(2) of the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol ('the Convention'): s 5 of the Migration Act . Nor is it open to an officer to consider whether the unlawful non-citizen's removal and return to a particular country is conformable with the obligation against refoulment is Art 33(1) of the Convention.\\n\\nIn the context of considering the Court's supervisory jurisdiction, the Court addressed the question of whether removing or refusing to remove an unlawful non-citizen under s 198(6) was a privative clause decision within s 474 of the Migration Act . The Court said (at 171-172 [88]): \\n \\n 'Removing or refusing to remove an unlawful non-citizen under s 198(6) of the Act does, however, constitute a \\\"privative clause decision\\\" for the purposes of the Act. Section 474(2) provides that, in s 474: \\n \\n \\n privative clause decision means a decision of an administrative character made, proposed to be made, or required to be made, as the case may be, under this Act ... (whether in the exercise of a discretion or not), other than a decision referred to in subsection (4) or (5). \\n \\n \\n There is no reference to s 198 in s 474(4) or (5). Section 474(3)(g) provides that a reference in s 474 to a \\\"decision\\\" includes a reference to \\\"doing or refusing to do any ... act or thing\\\". Removing or refusing to remove an unlawful non-citizen under s 198(6) is, by virtue of s 474(3)(g), a \\\"decision\\\" and, as such, a \\\"privative clause decision\\\" within the meaning of s 474(2). According to s 474(1), a privative clause decision: \\n (a) is final and conclusive; and \\n \\n \\n \\n (b) must not be challenged, appealed against, reviewed, quashed or called in question in any court; and \\n (c) is not subject to prohibition, mandamus, injunction, declaration or certiorari in any court on any account.'\\n\\nSome of the issues considered by the Full Court in M38\\/2002 were considered again by the Full Court in the subsequent decision in NATB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 292 ; (2003) 133 FCR 506 (' NATB '). The Court qualified the statement of the Full Court in M38\\/2002 that in the context of the Act, practicability and reasonableness may, on occasion, operate in opposing senses. The Court said that an element of reasonableness was inherent in practicability and the use of the word 'reasonably' may operate to extend the reasonableness notion, 'further along what may be described as \\\"the continuum of reasonableness\\\"' (at 516 [50]). The Court said that it would not attempt a definition of all the circumstances relevant to the concept of what was 'reasonably practicable'. It was impossible to foresee all the circumstances which may arise and the question involved a process of evaluation of the facts of each case. The Court said that physical considerations such as the health of the person to be removed and the availability of an operating airport in the place of destination were not the only relevant considerations. The willingness of a country to allow a person to enter its territory is at least one non-physical factor relevant to reasonable practicability. On the other hand, the limits on the matters relevant to reasonable practicability arise from the words themselves and the relevant considerations are practical considerations in the context of the proposed physical removal of a person from Australia.\\n\\nSubject to the one qualification which I have mentioned, nothing was said by the Full Court in NATB to suggest that the Court's observations and conclusions in M38\\/2002 were wrong and in particular the conclusion that to remove or to refuse to remove was a privative clause decision.\\n\\nThe applicant referred to the decision of the High Court in Al-Kateb v Godwin [2004] HCA 37 ; (2004) 219 CLR 562 (' Al-Kateb ') a case I will need to refer to again in another context.

The contrary does not follow, in that the absence of reference to 'opinion', 'belief' or 'satisfaction' of the decision-maker does not mean the factual reference is a jurisdictional fact (Aronson, Dyer and Groves, Judicial Review of Administrative Action (3 rd ed, 2000) pages 227-239).\\n 2. The nature of the task is important. If the task is a difficult and complex one involving an assessment of complex facts and the forming of opinions on a wide range of matters then that suggests that the factual reference is not a jurisdictional fact because it is considered that Parliament intended that the decision be made by the primary decision-maker: Australian Heritage Commission v Mount Isa Mines Ltd (1995) 60 FCR 456 per Black CJ at 465-466 (High Court: Australian Heritage Commission v Mount Isa Mines Ltd [1997] HCA 10 ; (1997) 187 CLR 297); Cabal v Attorney-General of the Commonwealth [2001] FCA 583 ; (2001) 113 FCR 154.\\n 3. If inconvenience results from holding that a factual reference is a jurisdictional fact then that will be considered a reason not to hold that it is a jurisdictional fact: Parisienne Basket Shoes Pty Ltd v Whyte [1938] HCA 7 ; (1938) 59 CLR 369; Australian Heritage Commission v Mount Isa Mines Ltd (1995) 60 FCR 456 per Black CJ at 465-466; Cabal v Attorney-General of the Commonwealth (supra) per Weinberg J at 173 [74]. With respect, the clearest statement of the principle remains that of Dixon J (as he then was) in Parisienne Basket Shoes Pty Ltd v Whyte (supra) (at 391):\\n 'It cannot be denied that, if the legislature see fit to do it, any event or fact or circumstance whatever may be made a condition upon the occurrence or existence of which the jurisdiction of a court shall depend. But, if the legislature does make the jurisdiction of a court contingent upon the actual existence of a state of facts, as distinguished from the court's opinion or determination that the facts do exist, then the validity of the proceedings and orders must always remain an outstanding question until some other court or tribunal, possessing power to determine that question, decides that the requisite state of facts in truth existed and the proceedings of the court were valid. Conceding the abstract possibility of the legislature adopting such a course, nevertheless it produces so inconvenient a result that no enactment dealing with proceedings in any of the ordinary courts of justice should receive such an interpretation unless the intention is clearly expressed.' \\n \\n 4. The importance of the decision in terms of the nature of the rights affected by it is a matter to be taken into account. If the rights at stake are fundamental or important rights then that may suggest that the factual reference is a jurisdictional fact: Buck v Comcare (1996) 66 FCR 359 per Finn J at 364.\",\"11\":\"The respondents submit that the relevant allegations in the statement of claim (ie, paragraphs 21, 22 and 23) do not support a conclusion that the removal of the applicant from Australia would constitute a failure to exercise jurisdiction or an excess of jurisdiction within the principles enunciated by the High Court in Plaintiff S157\\/2002 v Commonwealth [2003] HCA 2 ; (2003) 211 CLR 476. In other words, it is submitted by the respondents that the allegations in the statement of claim do not support the only challenge which may be made to a privative clause decision, namely, a challenge on the ground of jurisdictional error. Accordingly, the proposed removal of the applicant cannot be challenged.\\n\\nThe applicant submits that even if the removal of the applicant from Australia is a privative clause decision within s 474 it can be challenged on the ground of error of jurisdictional fact.\\n\\nThe respondents submit that if its first two submissions are correct, namely, that the decision to remove the applicant from Australia is a privative clause decision and as the allegations presently stand cannot be challenged, then the only possible federal claim is doomed to fail. The other claims in the proceedings are claims in tort which are not within the jurisdiction of this Court. The respondents submit that there is no room for the operation of the doctrines of associated or accrued jurisdiction.\",\"12\":\"The original jurisdiction previously exercised by this Court in relation to migration decisions is, subject to certain exceptions, now vested in the Federal Magistrates Court. The matters removed from the jurisdiction of this Court are described by reference to subject matter and the nexus with the subject matter removed from the jurisdiction of the Court is identified by words of wide import, namely, 'in relation to' although I recognise that the precise nexus identified by those words will be determined by the provisions of the Act in which they appear: PMT Partners Pty Ltd (In Liq) v Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service [1995] HCA 36 ; (1995) 184 CLR 301 per Toohey and Gummow JJ at 331-332. I do not think this Court has original jurisdiction to grant an injunction restraining the second respondent from removing the applicant from Australia.\\n\\nThe applicant sought to overcome the difficulties posed by s 476A by submitting that this Court has jurisdiction over his claim insofar as it involves a claim for an injunction against the first respondent who is alleged to be an officer of the Commonwealth (ie, the first injunction seeking to restrain a breach of a duty of care in tort) in relation to the detention of the applicant, and that the claim in tort against the Commonwealth in relation to both the detention and removal of the applicant and the claim that the removal of the applicant was beyond power and ultra vires are part of the accrued jurisdiction of the Court. The applicant submitted that s 476A is directed to the original jurisdiction of the Court and not the accrued jurisdiction of the Court.\\n\\nIn this case the submission that this Court has accrued jurisdiction is a novel one because the claim said to fall within the accrued jurisdiction is in fact a federal claim. By reason of an express statutory provision it is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Magistrates Court and not this Court. This exposes the fallacy of the applicant's argument. I do not think there can be accrued jurisdiction over a federal claim removed from the original jurisdiction of this Court and entrusted to the Federal Magistrates Court.\\n\\nI do not think that it is appropriate to make orders in relation to the draft notice of objection to competency. Part of the applicant's claim is within the jurisdiction of this Court, namely, the claim for an injunction against the first respondent and I did not understand the respondents to argue that this claim was not arguable. The claims in tort for damages against the Commonwealth of Australia may be within the associated or accrued jurisdiction of the court and if necessary I will hear further from the parties on this question.\\n\\nIt is appropriate to make orders on the second respondent's notice of motion. I will make the order sought in paragraph 1 of the notice of motion. Furthermore, it seems to me that it is also appropriate to make the orders sought in paragraphs 2 and 3, but because there was some uncertainty in the respondents' submissions as to whether I should make the order sought in paragraph 2, I will hear further from the parties (if they seek to be heard) as to the orders sought in paragraphs 2 and 3 of the notice of motion.\",\"13\":\"However, my conclusions to this point would not mean that the whole of the applicant's claim should be struck out. The claim against the first respondent for an injunction in relation to the detention of the applicant would appear to be within the jurisdiction of the Court ( Secretary, Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Mastipour (2004) 206 ALR 83; s 39B(1) Judiciary Act ) and the claim against the second respondent for damages for breach of a duty of care in relation to the detention of the applicant is arguably within the associated or accrued jurisdiction of the Court. Furthermore, it was not suggested that either of those claims are not arguable. More difficult questions arise in relation to the alleged claim for damages in tort against the second respondent in relation to the proposed removal of the applicant from Australia in light of the terms of s 474(1) of the Migration Act .\\n\\nIn addition to those matters, had it not been for the provisions of s 476A of the Migration Act my conclusions to this point would have given rise to a question as to whether the applicant should be given leave to re-plead the allegations in paragraphs 21, 22 and 23 to raise (if he is able to) an arguable case of jurisdictional error of the relevant type.\\n\\nEven if an arguable case of jurisdictional error of the relevant type could be raised in relation to the proposed removal of the applicant from Australia, this Court does not have jurisdiction to consider such a claim by reason of s 476A of the Migration Act .\",\"14\":\"I would follow these observations even if, as the applicant submits, they were not essential to the decision. They represent considered remarks of the Full Court and, moreover, in my respectful opinion they are correct. A 'decision' includes doing an act or thing (s 474(3)(g)) and a 'privative clause decision' includes a proposed decision ( WAJZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) (2004) 84 ALD 655 per French J at [70] (' WAJZ ').\\n\\nThe applicant referred to the decision of Al-Kateb in this context, but in my opinion there is nothing in that case which suggests that the question of reasonable practicability is a jurisdictional fact. It is true that certain Justices of the High Court considered what was encompassed by the phrase 'reasonable practicability'; Gummow J at 608 [121]; Hayne J at 639 [227]; Callinan J at 658-662 [290]-[299] but the Court did not address the question of whether reasonable practicability was a jurisdictional fact. Although his Honour was concerned with different questions to those arising before me, in my respectful opinion the High Court's treatment of the phrase was accurately summarised by French J in WAJZ at [83]-[85].\\n\\nAlthough the question of reasonable practicability is not a jurisdictional fact, the proposed removal of the applicant from Australia can be challenged on the other grounds which constitute jurisdictional error: WAJZ per French J (at [70]). I do not think that there can be any doubt that a circumstance relevant to the question of reasonable practicability is the applicant's physical and mental condition. The difficulty for the applicant is that a jurisdictional error of the relevant type is not pleaded in paragraphs 21, 22 and 23 of the statement of claim. Those paragraphs proceed on the assumption that it is sufficient to allege that as a matter of fact it is not reasonably practicable to remove the applicant from Australia. For the reasons I have given, that is not sufficient.\\n\\nIt is convenient if I state my conclusions to this point. Paragraphs 21, 22 and 23 must be struck out because the removal of the applicant from Australia is a privative clause decision and the paragraphs do not disclose an arguable case of jurisdictional error of the relevant type. It seems to me that it follows from the terms of s 474 that the removal of the applicant from Australia is not to be the subject of an injunction whether the claim is based on the allegation that removal is beyond power or on an alleged breach of a duty of care. It follows that the claim for an injunction based on an anticipated breach of a duty of care (paragraph 20(e)) cannot succeed. It must also follow that the somewhat novel claim (as far as I can see) in paragraph 24 cannot succeed. Furthermore, the claim for relief involving an injunction restraining the second respondent from removing the applicant from Australia (the second injunction) cannot succeed and the interlocutory injunction must be discharged.\"}}"
