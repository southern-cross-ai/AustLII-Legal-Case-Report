Further, the plaintiff submitted that having deployed some of the advice in support of its defence of good faith, it would be unfair for GSF to withhold the balance of the communications, dealing with the same subject matter, from scrutiny.\",\"1\":\"14 GSF submitted that the advices which have been disclosed ought to be regarded as separate and distinct from the instructions that were given, and the communications that took place, in connection with or leading up to the giving of that advice. It was submitted that these other associated documents need not be considered in order to understand of the advice that has been disclosed. Further, it was submitted that documents recording instructions and the like are not to be regarded as documents that were necessary inputs into the advice that has been disclosed. Reliance was placed by GSF on the decision of the Court of Appeal in Victoria in British American Tobacco Australia Services Ltd v Cowell [2002] VSCA 197 ; (2002) 7 VR 524.\\n\\n15 These submissions do not take into account the parallel principle that a party in litigation may expose its legal advice to discovery and production by making it relevant to an issue in the proceeding. In this case, by raising the defence based on s 588FG , GSF has put in issue whether it acted in good faith and without suspecting insolvency when it pursued the recommended course of serving a statutory demand. Having pleaded that matter into relevance, it has effectively exposed its legal advice on that very matter to scrutiny. The position is compounded by the disclosure of some of the advice without disclosing all of the communications that took place between GSF and its solicitors.\",\"2\":\"16 The principle of issue waiver, which has application where a party pleads legal advice into issue and thereby imputedly waives privilege, is a long standing one: see Thomason v Campbelltown Municipal Council (1939) 39 SR (NSW) 347 per Jordan CJ. The principle of issue waiver was recently considered and applied by the Full Court of this Court in Commissioner of Taxation v Rio Tinto Ltd [2006] FCAFC 86 ; (2006) 151 FCR 341 (' Rio Tinto' ). In that case, the Commissioner of Taxation was held to have imputedly waived privilege by filing particulars that referred to advice provided by the Australian Government Solicitor and Counsel: at 363 [74].\",\"3\":\"16 The principle of issue waiver, which has application where a party pleads legal advice into issue and thereby imputedly waives privilege, is a long standing one: see Thomason v Campbelltown Municipal Council (1939) 39 SR (NSW) 347 per Jordan CJ.

GSF has imputedly waived any legal professional privilege attaching to documents numbered 1 to 44 inclusive in its particulars of documents produced by Turks over which legal professional privilege is claimed. Accordingly, those documents must be produced pursuant to the two subpoenas.\",\"4\":\"17 In my opinion, whether one approaches the issues by applying the principles of associated material waiver as described in Attorney-General (NT) v Maurice [1986] HCA 80 ; (1986) 161 CLR 475 at 482, 484, 488 and 498-499, or by applying the principles of issue waiver as discussed by the Full Court in the Rio Tinto case, one arrives at the same result.
