As Sheppard J said in Thorp v C.A. Imports Pty Ltd (1990) ATPR 40-996 at 50,966, the question is one of fact and degree depending upon a consideration of the entirety of the steps required to manufacture the object in question. Of course, in addition, it is now necessary to apply ss 65AB and 65AE.\\n\\nThe evidence shows that the cost to ADC of the carved wooden bird (and like objects) was under $10. The amount paid to Mr Goodridge for painting it was in excess of $30. The precise figures varied, according to the size of the objects. Even allowing for shipment costs, I find that s 65AB(c) of the TP Act would be satisfied, if there had been a representation that those artworks were Australian in origin.\\n\\nThe remaining issue is whether those items were substantially transformed by being painted in Australia: s 65AB(b). The alleged country of origin representations did not attract ss 65AC or 65AD, so s 65AB(d) was also satisfied. That is a question of fact, informed by s 65AE. In my judgment, those artworks including the carved wooden bird were substantially transformed by being painted in Australia. There was in evidence an example of the carved wooden bird, unpainted (it is then purely a flat white in colour). The difference is significant. As an unpainted object, it is quite unappealing. The shape itself seems to lack definition. The painting makes the object quite a different one: the shape emerges as clearly defined, and the colouring gives the object a real life and attractiveness. I think the description \\\"new and different goods\\\" is an appropriate one, even though fundamentally the shape itself does not change. It is, in a bland sense, and remains a carved wooden item but the qualities which make it an attractive object emerge only after it is painted. Analogy is always a little dangerous, but I essay one, albeit not a perfect one: a painter's canvas may be imported, and although it does not change size, the canvas is substantially transformed by being painted. The carved wooden bird shape is, of course, not the equivalent of a canvas. It is already shaped. However, the dramatic change in appearance, including that the painting seems to add definition to the shape, has to my mind a not dissimilar transformation.\"}}"
