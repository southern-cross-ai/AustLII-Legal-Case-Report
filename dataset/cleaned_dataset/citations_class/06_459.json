The Yawuru claimants opposed any such limitation and contended that that limitation would be inconsistent with their right to exclusive possession, which they claimed entitled the native title holders to determine the purposes for which the land and waters were to be used. The Yawuru claimants relied upon Sampi v State of Western Australia (No 2) [2005] FCA 1567 (' Sampi No 2 '), in which it was contended that the determination of native title fishing rights should expressly exclude 'non-commercial rights'. French J stated (at [90]):\\n \\n 'Given that commercial fishing rights are subject to legislative control and that the native title rights and interests are to be exercisable in accordance with the laws of the State and the Commonwealth, it is difficult to see how the determination as proposed by the applicants would extend to commercial fishing rights.'\\n\\n9 The Yawuru claimants contended that commercial exploitation of the resources of the land and waters in the Yawuru claim area is likewise the subject of extensive governmental regulation.

The reason for the 'formal' submission was that WAFIC accepted that in Sampi (on behalf of the Bardi and Jawi People) v Western Australia [2005] FCA 777 (' Sampi ') at [1146]-[1147], French J had rejected the same submission. WAFIC also accepted that the decision of French J would be followed by other single judges of the Court unless it was shown to be clearly wrong. Although WAFIC wished to preserve the point for any appeal, it did not contend that the decision of French J was clearly wrong. Accordingly, I reject WAFIC's submission for the reasons given by French J in Sampi , with which I respectfully agree.\\n\\n16 Several issues arose concerning the description of the native title holders. In accordance with the evidence concerning the traditional laws and customs acknowledged and observed by the Yawuru community, and the findings in Rubibi No 5 and Rubibi No 6 , I am satisfied that:\\n \\n (a) Lulu should not be named as one of the apical ancestors; \\n \\n \\n (b) (i) membership of the native title holding community in the case of a descendant of an apical ancestor does not require the criteria of self-identification or general community acceptance to be satisfied where both parents of the descendant are Yawuru;\\n (ii) where only one parent of a descendant is Yawuru, the criterion of self-identification must be satisfied; and \\n \\n \\n (c) persons who are not descendants of an apical ancestor may nonetheless be members of the native title holding community if they were adopted as children or grown up by a Yawuru person as a member of the Yawuru community, or are persons who were born in or have a long term physical association with the Yawuru claim area and have cultural responsibilities in relation to that area, provided that the criteria of self-identification and general community acceptance are satisfied.\\n\\n17 The Walman Yawuru representative made certain criticisms of the criteria in (b) and (c) above. In particular, it was contended that the criterion of general community acceptance should apply where there was only one Yawuru parent. The criterion of general community acceptance referred to in par (c) above is based on the findings and observations I made concerning that matter at [291] and [348] in Rubibi 5 and at [104] and [105] in Rubibi 6 . I have been troubled by whether that criterion should also apply to the situation of a descendant who has only one Yawuru parent but have decided, primarily on the basis of the evidence referred at [105] in Rubibi No 6 , that that criterion is not required by traditional law and custom. However, it should be emphasised that in order for self-identification to be genuine, something more is required than an announcement on a particular day that a person identifies himself or herself as a member of the Yawuru community. The genuineness of self-identification is to be determined by reference to all relevant facts, which can include past conduct in relation to self-identification. In all the circumstances, I am not satisfied that traditional law and custom requires that the additional criterion of general community acceptance must be satisfied in the case of a descendant who only has one Yawuru parent.\",\"6\":\"20 Section 22 of the NTA as originally enacted (cf s 240A of the current NTA ) provided that an impermissible future act is invalid to the extent that it 'affects native title'. Section 227 of the NTA as originally enacted provided that an act affects native title if it extinguishes native title rights and interests, or if it is otherwise wholly or partly inconsistent with their continued existence, enjoyment or exercise. The freehold grants were future acts that were not validated by any provision of the NTA , with the result that they were impermissible future acts under the NTA as originally enacted and appear to be invalid to the extent that they affect native title: see Neowarra v State of Western Australia [2003] FCA 1402 (' Neowarra ') at [586]. While it can be accepted that the freehold grants are valid insofar as they do not affect native title, they cannot have any extinguishing effect or confer rights that are inconsistent with the native title rights and interests I have found to exist. However, as a result of my finding later in these reasons that reserve 631 (which included 139 of the relevant freehold areas) was validly created, the native title rights and interests in respect of 139 of the relevant freeholds are not exclusive rights. It also appears that the remaining freehold lot was subject to a similar prior tenure or reserve. Accordingly, such of the rights and interests of the freehold owners as are not inconsistent with the rights and interests of the native title holders can co-exist with those native title rights and interests.\\n\\n21 The State argued that, as the freehold grants were valid for some purposes, s 47B could not apply to the grants. I doubt that the argument is correct but nothing turns on it because, as explained above, the freehold grants appear to have had no extinguishing effect on native title with the consequence that there was no extinguishment to be disregarded under s 47B. In any event, no relevant occupation was established for the purposes of s 47B so the section would not apply to the areas covered by the 140 freehold grants.\\n\\n63 However, the State contended for a different outcome in respect of areas covered by mining leases issued under the Mining Act 1978 (WA) ('the MA '). The State relied upon the extensive rights conferred under s 85 of the MA to use, occupy and enjoy the land in respect of which the mining lease was granted. The rights included the right to do all things that are necessary to carry out 'mining operations' in, on and under the land. The phrase 'mining operations' is given a wide definition in s 8 of the MA . The State also relied upon the decisions in Neowarra (at [522] and [613]) and Daniel (at [741], [768] and [822]) to contend that any permanent native title right to live on the land in respect of which a mining lease has been granted has been extinguished.\\n\\n69 In Rubibi Community v Western Australia (No 4) [2004] FCA 1019 ; (2004) 138 FCR 536, I determined that the date 'when the application is made' is the date of the filing in the Court of the application for native title in respect of 'the area' referred to in ss 47A(1)(c) and 47B(1)(c). Plainly, 'the area' referred to in those sub-sections must be an area within the area the subject of a claimant application. However, as was explained by Sundberg J in Neowarra at [686] and [721], the area need not be the whole of the area claimed as that could lead to clearly unintended consequences in relation to the operation of ss 47A and 47B. Rather, the relevant area is the particular area with which each of the sections is concerned.\\n\\n70 Textual, contextual and purposive considerations all point to 'the area' that is referred to in s 47A(1)(c) being 'the area' referred to in s 47A(1)(b). That is, 'the area' is the particular area the subject of the defined freehold estate, the defined lease, the defined vesting or the land expressly held or reserved for the benefit of Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders. That was the view taken by Sundberg J in Neowarra (at [686]) and, in my view, is clearly correct. Insofar as there may be doubt about that matter, pars 5.45-5.49 of the Explanatory Memorandum for the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 , which inserted ss 47A and 47B, make it clear that the occupation is to be in respect of 'the land' the subject of the past 'land rights type' grant, trust, reservation or other historical act that would otherwise have extinguished native title in relation to that land. It follows that the occupation that must be established for the purposes of s 47A(1)(c) is an occupation in respect of the relevant 'area', that is the whole, rather than merely a part, of the particular area the subject of the freehold estate, lease, vesting etc.\\n\\n71 The situation under s 47B differs from that under s 47A because s 47B requires that at the date the application is made 'the area' is not covered by a freehold estate, lease, reservation etc. However, as was pointed out by Sundberg J in Neowarra at [721], the relevant area for the purposes of s 47B is 'the particular area in relation to which it has been concluded that, but for the section, native title rights would be extinguished'. That construction of s 47B is consistent with par 5.56 of the Explanatory Memorandum for the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 which states:\\n \\n 'Section 47B is a statutory mechanism designed to allow native title claimants who are in occupation of vacant Crown land to overcome the effect of past extinguishment and have their claim determined by the Court. The current section 47 allows a claim for pastoral lease land, notwithstanding past extinguishment, where the claimants hold the pastoral lease. This provision will allow a claim for vacant Crown land where the claimants are in occupation of the land, notwithstanding possible extinguishment by any historical act.'\\n\\n72 It follows that the occupation that must be established for the purposes of s 47B(1)(c) must also be an occupation in respect of the whole, rather than merely a part, of the particular area in respect of which, but for s 47B, native title rights would be extinguished: see Neowarra at [758]-[760].\\n\\n77 This approach has been accepted and followed in a number of other cases (see, for example, Daniel at [938], Alyawar at 496 [193] and Neowarra at [682]).\\n\\n95 In Neowarra at [697]-[698], Sundberg J considered the requirement in s 47A(1)(b)(ii) that the area be held expressly for the benefit of Aboriginal peoples. His Honour considered that 'expressly' meant not merely impliedly and not arising merely by inference. His Honour also referred to cases that had decided that for something to be express, rather than implied, it must arise directly from the language used and not by inference therefrom.\\n\\n96 Sundberg J then applied the above criteria to an association incorporated under the ACA Act and stated (at [706]):\\n \\n 'The remaining question is whether, as they assert, the Rules of Kupungarri Aboriginal Corporation (under the ACA Act) show that Kupungarri holds the lease \\\"expressly for the benefit of...Aboriginal peoples\\\". Kupungarri's property is \\\"available, at the discretion of the Committee, for the purpose of carrying out the objects of the Association\\\". The objects in r 6 are all directed to the benefit of a group of Aboriginal people education, job training, housing, health services and so on. The Rules clearly and unmistakably disclose that Kupungarri's property is held by it for the benefit of Aboriginal persons. They make that explicit. There is no need to imply that from the Rules or any other source. The case falls within s 47A(1)(b)(ii).'\\n\\n98 The remaining issue is whether the requisite occupation has been established in respect of area 354. I accept, as did Sundberg J in Neowarra at [708], that a combination of activities in the area can amount to occupation by claim group members, notwithstanding that the area is also occupied by the corporation. The problem with the claim under s 47A in respect of area 354 is that the activity relied upon is residence in one of the two houses on the area by a Yawuru claim group member. As explained above, s 47A requires occupancy of the whole of the area, not merely part of the area. Accordingly, the requisite occupancy has not been established.\\n\\n99 The State argued that the area is not within s 47A and that there is no relevant occupation. This area is a freehold block in Broome at which Bidyadanga Aboriginal Community La Grange Inc (an Aboriginal Association incorporated under the ACA) conducts a sobering up centre. The association is not relevantly distinguishable from the associations above. For the reasons given in respect of area 354, the area is held expressly for the benefit of Aboriginal peoples. However, the involvement of some Yawuru persons, as well as others, in co-ordinating and using the centre is not sufficient to constitute occupation of the centre for the purposes of s 47A.\\n\\n100 The State argued that this area is not within s 47A and that there is no relevant occupation. For the reasons given in respect of area 354, this area is held by Nirrumbuk Aboriginal Corporation expressly for the benefit of Aboriginal peoples. However, the requisite occupation at the date of the application has not been established by the evidence.\\n\\n128 Although it was accepted by the parties that the resolution of the dispute involved matters of fact and degree, the State's submissions set out a number of useful examples and guidelines:\\n \\n 'In Hayes v Northern Territory [1999] FCA 1248 ; (1999) 97 FCR 32 ( Hayes ) at page 109 (xiv) Justice Olney found that \\\"it may well be inferred that 'recreation equipment' would be both a structure and a fixture.\\\" Again, at page 102 (viii), his Honour stated that \\\"... there is no evidence of any building or structure in the nature of a fixture other than possibly a fence ...\\\" Clearly Justice Olney regarded recreation equipment and fences as examples of structures that could be considered as public works for the purposes of the NTA . This accords with the ordinary meaning of structure being simply something \\\"built or constructed\\\". \\n \\n At page 108 of Hayes his Honour said: \\n \\n \\n \\n \\\"Whether or not a particular structure is to be regarded as a fixture will depend upon the context in which that question has to be determined but the general principles are well established and do not need to be recited here.\\\" \\n \\n \\n \\n The general principles can be summarised as follows: \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 217.1 The common law previously looked to the degree of annexation of an item; if substantially affixed, the item was a fixture, otherwise, it remained a chattel. \\n 217.2 The importance of annexation has, however, declined over time, and the focus now is on the intention with which the item was put in place; if for better use or enjoyment of the land, the item is a fixture, for better use or enjoyment of the item, it is likely to be a chattel. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n There are two prima facie presumptions applied: \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 218.1 first, if an item is affixed to the land, it is presumed to be a fixture, and the burden of proof lies on those who assert it is not; \\n 218.2 second, if an item rests by its own weight, it is presumed not to be a fixture, and the burden of proof rests on those asserting that it is. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n The presumptions may be rebutted by evidence to the contrary; for example, stone blocks resting by their own weight and placed to form a dry stone wall would be intended for better enjoyment of the land, and hence a fixture, whereas such blocks stacked in a builders yard would not. \\n \\n A concrete rail head or culvert for a drain, on the principles set out above, is more likely to have been put in place to enhance enjoyment of the land, hence would be a fixture, regardless of whether it is affixed or resting of its own weight. Likewise, it cannot be said as a matter of generality that playground equipment or pine bollard fencing are not fixtures, as it will depend upon the intention of the person or persons who bring it onto the land. \\n \\n In Daniel v State of Western Australia [2003] FCA 666 at [1047] Nicholson J found that water tanks and sewerage and waste water treatment plants were public work previous exclusive possession acts. \\n \\n In Sampi at [1126] and [1148] his Honour Justice French found a radio site constructed by Telstra to be a public work previous exclusive possession act. \\n \\n As to major earthworks, the Explanatory Memorandum to the Native Title Bill 1993 gave as examples: \\n \\n \\n \\n \\\"... dams and weirs whose construction permanently and significantly disturbs or changes the land.\\\" \\n \\n \\n \\n Excluded from the examples given were digging wells, cultivating land for crops or establishing a walking trail in a National Park. \\n \\n ... \\n \\n In any event, as to the extent of the public works in each area, the First Respondent relies upon the decision of his Honour Justice Sundberg in Neowarra v State of Western Australia (No 1) [2003] FCA 1399 ; (2003) 134 FCR 208 ( Neowarra ) at [654] to [660] to the effect that: \\n \\n \\n \\n \\\"Section 251D [NTA] is specifically directed to public works, and is plainly intended to operate in conjunction with ss 23B(7) and 23C(2). There is no reason to deny its beneficial function of ensuring that a public work has the benefit of adjacent land that is necessary for or incidental to the operation of the work, especially in relation to access to landlocked works.\\\"'\",\"7\":\"22 The Commonwealth made submissions on this issue because two of the 140 freeholds in question are held by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. In the course of the Commonwealth's submissions, it became apparent that the 140 freehold grants were in the Cable Beach area and probably had houses constructed upon them by the freehold grantees, or by purchasers from those grantees, who had not been informed of these proceedings or of the likelihood that their rights were subject to the rights and interests of the native title holders. This extraordinary situation apparently came about because the Western Australian statutory regime relied upon by the State (to ensure that freeholds granted by it after 1 January 1994 prevailed over native title) was held by the High Court in State of Western Australia v The Commonwealth (Native Title Act Case) [1995] HCA 47 ; (1995) 183 CLR 373 ('the Native Title Act Case ') to be invalid. Plainly, the situation is one that will have to be resolved between owners of the freeholds, the State and the native title holders. One likely method of resolution is an indigenous land use agreement under which the native title holders may relinquish their native title rights and interests on appropriate terms.\\n\\n23 When this issue arose at the hearing, I expressed grave concern at how the matter had arrived at this stage without the freehold grantees or their purchasers having notice of the likelihood that the freehold grants are invalid to the extent that they affect native title. The Commonwealth's response to my concern appears to provide the answer which is that, properly construed, the relevant application of the Yawuru claimants did not claim the areas in respect of which the freehold grants were made. If that contention is correct that would preclude the Court from making a determination of native title in respect of the relevant areas but it will not make the problem disappear. As against the State I have found that, subject to extinguishment, native title exists throughout the Yawuru claim area. Even if the 140 lots do not technically fall within that area they are not relevantly distinguishable from the surrounding areas in which native title has been found to exist. It must follow that the problem created by the State by its 140 freehold grants, which were not validated by the NTA , will still have to be resolved by the relevant parties.\\n\\n24 I now turn to consider whether the 140 lots fall within the Yawuru claim area. The relevant application (#WN95\\/7) which was filed on 11 January 1995 was known, prior to the consolidation of the various applications, as Rubibi # 5 . The application was lodged with the Native Title Tribunal on 11 January 1995, which was prior to the decision in the Native Title Act Case . After certain amendments, which were made during January 1995, the application was accepted by the Native Title Tribunal. The application was in the form prescribed by Sch 1 of the NTA which, relevantly, provided for a description and a map of the area covered by the application and for the applicants to set out the information known to them about other interests in relation to the land and waters in the claim area: see pars A6 and A7 of the prescribed form. Paragraph A6 of the amended application stated that the area covered by the application was the land indicated on the attached map. It added that:\\n \\n 'The land claimed is in the State of Western Australia in the West Kimberley Region and covers all areas of land, currently designated Vacant Crown Land or Reserve , as fall within the area edged and hatched in heavy black lines on the accompanying map, save and except [certain specified Reserves]. ...' (emphasis added)\",\"8\":\"41 The law applicable to a challenge to the validity of a regulation made in the exercise of a statutory power to make regulations would appear to be applicable to the analogous exercise of a power to reserve land for certain purposes under a regulation that provides for the exercise of that power. In South Australia v Tanner [1989] HCA 3 ; (1989) 166 CLR 161 at 178-9, Brennan J stated that, as the validity of a regulation depends on whether it answers the statutory description, the problem is one of characterisation. His Honour explained that the character of the regulation is ascertained by the court's own assessment of the directness and substantiability of the connection between the likely operation of the regulation and the statutory object to be served. Wilson, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ stated (at 165):\\n \\n '... there must be conceded a broad, rather than a narrow, approach in determining the nexus between the exercise of the power and the achievement of the purpose for which it is conferred.' \\n \\n\\nand (at 168):\\n \\n 'In the course of argument the parties accepted the reasonable proportionality test of validity (cf. Deane J. in The Commonwealth v Tasmania (the Tasmanian Dam Case); namely, whether the regulation is capable of being considered to be reasonably proportionate to the pursuit of the enabling purpose.' (footnote omitted)\\n\\n42 Regulation 29(13) is in the broadest of terms and extends to any purpose of public 'utility' or of 'otherwise facilitating the improvement and settlement of the Colony'. In my view, 'public purposes adjoining Broome, Roebuck Bay' is plainly capable of being considered reasonably proportionate to the pursuit of the enabling purpose and therefore falls within reg 29(13). It is a purpose that is implicitly, if not explicitly, associated with the development of the Broome township and, as such, is both directly and substantially connected to being a purpose of public 'utility' and is also capable of being characterised as a purpose facilitating the improvement and settlement of Broome in the Colony of Western Australia.\\n\\n56 In Ward HC , the question of extinguishment in respect of a reserve was carefully considered in the majority judgment at 137-142:\\n \\n \\n '214. It is important to recall that the ultimate question is whether, by the steps that were taken, the Crown created in others, or asserted, rights in relation to the land that were inconsistent with native title rights and interests over the land. It was submitted that the features of the statutory regulation of public reserves which we have mentioned indicated that reservation, even without vesting, amounted to dedication to the purpose specified in the instrument of reservation in the sense, so it was submitted, that reservation prevented the Crown from applying the land to some other purpose and created some right in members of the public generally or a section of the public. \\n 215. The reference by Brennan J, in the passage of his reasons in Mabo [No 2] that is set out earlier, to use of the land that is reserved, may distract attention from the relevant inquiries. They are, as we have said, whether rights have been created in others that are rights inconsistent with native title rights and interests, and whether the Crown has asserted rights over the land that are inconsistent with native title rights and interests. Use of the land may suggest, it may even demonstrate, that such rights have been created or asserted, but the basic inquiry is about inconsistency of rights, not inconsistency of use. Further, as has already been pointed out, it is often necessary to examine inconsistency by reference to the particular native title right and interest concerned. \\n \\n \\n ... \\n \\n \\n 219. Nevertheless, by designating land as a reserve for a public purpose, even a purpose as broadly described as 'public utility', the executive, acting pursuant to legislative authority, decided the use or uses to which the land could be put. The executive thus exercised the power that was asserted at settlement by saying how the land could be used. The exercise of that power was inconsistent with any continued exercise of power by native title holders to decide how the land could or could not be used. The executive had taken to itself and asserted (pursuant to the authority conferred in that regard by statute) the right to say how the land could be used. This step was not, however, necessarily inconsistent with the native title holders continuing to use the land in whatever way they had, according to traditional laws and customs, been entitled to use it before its reservation. \\n 220. The reason that the right to use the land may have survived reservation is the same reason that the grant of a pastoral lease extinguished the right to control access to the land, but not necessarily all the rights of native title holders to use it in accordance with the rights held under traditional laws or customs. The provisions of the Acts providing a penalty for \\\"unlawful or unauthorised use or occupation\\\" of lands (including \\\"lands reserved for or dedicated to any public purpose\\\") did not, on their proper construction, prohibit use or occupation by native title holders. It is, therefore, not right to say, as a proposition of universal application, as Western Australia submitted, that reserved lands could not lawfully be used except for the reserved purpose. The facts that the 1905 amendments to the Land Act 1898 permitted leasing of reserves not immediately required for their purpose or that in 1960 the Land Act 1933 was amended to permit leasing or licensing of certain kinds of reserve for depasturing stock require no different conclusion. Whether a right in native title holders to use the land continued unextinguished depends upon other considerations, particularly what, if any, rights in others were created by the reservation or later asserted by the executive. \\n 221. The designation of land as a reserve for certain purposes did not, without more, create any right in the public or any section of the public which, by reason of inconsistency and apart from the State Validation Act , extinguished native title rights and interests. \\n \\n \\n ... \\n \\n \\n 233. The majority of the Full Court treated the use that had been made of reserved land, even land that had been vested in a body or person, as determining whether native title had been extinguished. So, for example, it was held in relation to Reserve 1059 (a reserve which had been created in 1886 for \\\"public utility\\\" but had not been vested in any body or person) that \\\"[t]he general use of the area for watering cattle, and as a pastoral lease destroyed the exclusivity of native title rights\\\". Their Honours went on to say that \\\"[t]he close use\\\" of the area of Reserve 1059 which now forms part of another reserve \\\"would have wholly extinguished native title in that area\\\". Similarly, in the case of reserves vested in a body, their Honours looked to the use that had been made of the land. \\n 234. As we have said earlier, we consider that looking to the use that has actually been made of land distracts attention from the central inquiry which is an inquiry about rights created in others or asserted by the executive, not the way in which they may have been exercised at any time. Neither the Full Court nor the primary judge considered that central inquiry.'\\n\\n57 The above passages provide the answer to the State's submission. By creating the reserves for a gaol and a police station, the executive did not create rights in others. Rather, the executive asserted its right to say how the land could be used and the assertion of that right extinguished any native title right to control or say how the land could or could not be used. However, that was not necessarily inconsistent with the native title holders continuing to use the land in whatever way they had, according to traditional laws and customs, been entitled to use it before its reservation.\",\"9\":\"43 It can be accepted that the phrase 'public purposes' has a broad meaning. In Bathurst City Council v PWC Properties Pty Ltd [1998] HCA 59 ; (1998) 195 CLR 566 (' Bathurst ') at 590 [58] Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ stated that the phrase 'public purposes' connotes 'the giving to the public of some rights in the land which subtract from the Crown's full ownership'. Their Honours stated at 591 [62]:\\n \\n 'the meaning of \\\"public purposes\\\" depends in part upon the scope and purposes of the particular legislation...'\",\"10\":\"44 Further, in the majority judgment in Western Australia v Ward [2002] HCA 28 ; (2002) 213 CLR 1 (' Ward HC ') at 137-138 [218]-[219], their Honours observed:\\n \\n \\n '218. Reservation of land under the relevant Western Australian provisions inhibited the Crown's future action in relation to that land. The inhibition, however, was not, and could not be, absolute. As Windeyer J pointed out in Randwick Corporation v Rutledge , even if land were dedicated to a public purpose, it did not take the land outside the authority of the legislature. Moreover, under the Western Australian statutes, reserves, other than those dealt with by the Permanent Reserves Act 1899 (WA) and its legislative successor, could be cancelled or the purpose of the reservation altered by executive act. Even permanent reserves could be cancelled or the purpose of the reservation altered by statute. Further, as had been held in Williams v Attorney-General for New South Wales ('the Government House Case '), the Crown appropriating lands to a particular purpose, without the creation of a trust, did not mean that the land became dedicated to that purpose, or that it could not later be used by the Crown for some other purpose. \\n 219. Nevertheless, by designating land as a reserve for a public purpose, even a purpose as broadly described as 'public utility', the executive, acting pursuant to legislative authority, decided the use or uses to which the land could be put. The executive thus exercised the power that was asserted at settlement by saying how the land could be used. The exercise of that power was inconsistent with any continued exercise of power by native title holders to decide how the land could or could not be used. The executive had taken to itself and asserted (pursuant to the authority conferred in that regard by statute) the right to say how the land could be used. This step was not, however, necessarily inconsistent with the native title holders continuing to use the land in whatever way they had, according to traditional laws and customs, been entitled to use it before its reservation.' (footnotes omitted)\\n\\n45 Although their Honours were not determining the precise legal consequences of a reservation of land for public purposes, there is nothing in the above passages that suggests that there is any particular difficulty with such a reservation.\\n\\n46 For the above reasons, I am satisfied that reserve 631 was created for one of the purposes specified in reg 29 (13) and was validly created.\\n\\n47 Reserves 1637, 1640 and 1644 were created for 'public purposes' under the Land Regulations 1887 (WA), which were not relevantly distinguishable from the Land Regulations 1882 (WA), save that the later regulations assumed that reserves could be created for 'public purposes': see regs 2 and 36 (which defined 'public purposes'). Thus, if there is any distinction to be drawn between the two sets of regulations, it is one that provides added support to the State's argument in favour of the valid creation of the relevant reserves. As it was accepted by the parties that the finding in respect of reserve 631 would determine the issue of validity in respect of all four of these reserves, I need not pursue this aspect of the matter further. It follows that reserves 1637, 1640 and 1644 were also validly created.\\n\\n48 On 1 April 1930, a special lease was purportedly granted under s 153 of the Land Act 1898 (WA) ('the LA 1898 ') over Broome Lot 622 (which comprises all of area 2733). The lease, which was for a term of five years commencing on 1 April 1930, was for the purpose of 'a foreshore camp, store site and repairing boats'.\",\"11\":\"55 The Yawuru claimants did not contest the extinguishment claimed in respect of the areas on which the gaol and the police station have been constructed. As I later explain, it is common ground that extinguishment has occurred in any event in respect of those areas because the gaol and police station are public works. The contest relates to the vacant land in the reserves that has not yet been used for the purposes of a gaol or police station. Although a similar issue was considered in Daniel v State of Western Australia [2003] FCA 666 (' Daniel ') at [688] and [698], the question of whether the assertion of the right to build a gaol or a prison on part of the reserved land extinguished inconsistent native title rights over the whole of the reserved land was not considered in Daniel or Ward HC .\\n\\n128 Although it was accepted by the parties that the resolution of the dispute involved matters of fact and degree, the State's submissions set out a number of useful examples and guidelines:\\n \\n 'In Hayes v Northern Territory [1999] FCA 1248 ; (1999) 97 FCR 32 ( Hayes ) at page 109 (xiv) Justice Olney found that \\\"it may well be inferred that 'recreation equipment' would be both a structure and a fixture.\\\" Again, at page 102 (viii), his Honour stated that \\\"... there is no evidence of any building or structure in the nature of a fixture other than possibly a fence ...\\\" Clearly Justice Olney regarded recreation equipment and fences as examples of structures that could be considered as public works for the purposes of the NTA . This accords with the ordinary meaning of structure being simply something \\\"built or constructed\\\". \\n \\n At page 108 of Hayes his Honour said: \\n \\n \\n \\n \\\"Whether or not a particular structure is to be regarded as a fixture will depend upon the context in which that question has to be determined but the general principles are well established and do not need to be recited here.\\\" \\n \\n \\n \\n The general principles can be summarised as follows: \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 217.1 The common law previously looked to the degree of annexation of an item; if substantially affixed, the item was a fixture, otherwise, it remained a chattel. \\n 217.2 The importance of annexation has, however, declined over time, and the focus now is on the intention with which the item was put in place; if for better use or enjoyment of the land, the item is a fixture, for better use or enjoyment of the item, it is likely to be a chattel. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n There are two prima facie presumptions applied: \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 218.1 first, if an item is affixed to the land, it is presumed to be a fixture, and the burden of proof lies on those who assert it is not; \\n 218.2 second, if an item rests by its own weight, it is presumed not to be a fixture, and the burden of proof rests on those asserting that it is. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n The presumptions may be rebutted by evidence to the contrary; for example, stone blocks resting by their own weight and placed to form a dry stone wall would be intended for better enjoyment of the land, and hence a fixture, whereas such blocks stacked in a builders yard would not. \\n \\n A concrete rail head or culvert for a drain, on the principles set out above, is more likely to have been put in place to enhance enjoyment of the land, hence would be a fixture, regardless of whether it is affixed or resting of its own weight. Likewise, it cannot be said as a matter of generality that playground equipment or pine bollard fencing are not fixtures, as it will depend upon the intention of the person or persons who bring it onto the land. \\n \\n In Daniel v State of Western Australia [2003] FCA 666 at [1047] Nicholson J found that water tanks and sewerage and waste water treatment plants were public work previous exclusive possession acts. \\n \\n In Sampi at [1126] and [1148] his Honour Justice French found a radio site constructed by Telstra to be a public work previous exclusive possession act. \\n \\n As to major earthworks, the Explanatory Memorandum to the Native Title Bill 1993 gave as examples: \\n \\n \\n \\n \\\"... dams and weirs whose construction permanently and significantly disturbs or changes the land.\\\" \\n \\n \\n \\n Excluded from the examples given were digging wells, cultivating land for crops or establishing a walking trail in a National Park. \\n \\n ... \\n \\n In any event, as to the extent of the public works in each area, the First Respondent relies upon the decision of his Honour Justice Sundberg in Neowarra v State of Western Australia (No 1) [2003] FCA 1399 ; (2003) 134 FCR 208 ( Neowarra ) at [654] to [660] to the effect that: \\n \\n \\n \\n \\\"Section 251D [NTA] is specifically directed to public works, and is plainly intended to operate in conjunction with ss 23B(7) and 23C(2). There is no reason to deny its beneficial function of ensuring that a public work has the benefit of adjacent land that is necessary for or incidental to the operation of the work, especially in relation to access to landlocked works.\\\"'\",\"12\":\"58 There remains the question of whether, by constructing a gaol and a police station on the reserves, the Crown 'created in others, or asserted, rights in relation to the land that were inconsistent with native title rights and interests over the land': see [214] in Ward HC . In my view, the exercise of the right to construct a gaol or police station on part only of the reserved land is not necessarily inconsistent with native title rights and interests in the remaining part of the reserved land if that part of the reserve is not reasonably necessary for, or incidental to, the operation or enjoyment of the gaol or police station: cf De Rose v South Australia (No 2) [2005] FCAFC 110 ; (2005) 145 FCR 290 (' De Rose No 2 ') at 332 [152] and 335 [166]. In De Rose No 2 , that formulation was applied in respect of the extinguishment that occurred upon the exercise by the lessee of the lessee's right under a pastoral lease to construct improvements. In the present context, the exercise of the right to construct an improvement on a reserve in pursuance of the reserved purpose is analogous to the exercise of the right to construct an improvement under a pastoral lease. Accordingly, it is appropriate to apply the same criterion. As that criterion is similar to, but not identical with, the criterion that is to be applied to the gaol and police station as public works under s 251D of the NTA , it is appropriate to deal with both criteria in the context of the extinguishment that resulted from the construction of the gaol and the police station as public works.\\n\\n59 In summary, construction of the gaol and police station on part of the reserves extinguished native title rights and interests in the areas on which the gaol and police station were constructed and on areas adjacent thereto that were reasonably necessary for or incidental to the operation or enjoyment of the gaol or police station. However, the construction did not necessarily extinguish native title rights and interests in respect of the remaining areas of the respective reserves.\\n\\n60 It was common ground that, as a result of the decision in Ward HC , the grant of valid pastoral or mining leases was inconsistent with, and therefore extinguished, any native title right or interest to exclusive possession of, or to control access to or use of, the areas the subject of the leases. It was also common ground that, as a result of the decision of the Full Court in De Rose No 2 at 329-335 [139]-[165], the exercise by the pastoral lessees of their rights under the leases to construct improvements on the land leased was inconsistent with the continuation of any inconsistent native title rights or interests insofar as they related to the land on which the improvements were constructed and any adjacent land the use of which was reasonably necessary for, or incidental to, the operation or enjoyment of the improvements.\",\"13\":\"61 The issue on which the Yawuru claimants and the State differed concerned whether the native title right and interest 'to live' on the leased land was inconsistent with the rights conferred by the pastoral or mining leases. The State accepted that I was bound by the decision of the Full Court in Northern Territory of Australia v Alyawarr, Kaytetye, Warumungu, Wakaya Native Title Claim Group [2005] FCAFC 135 ; (2005) 145 FCR 442 (' Alyawarr ') at 480-481 [130]-[132] to find that the native title right to live on a pastoral lease is not inconsistent with the rights of the lessee under the lease. In Alyawarr , the Full Court stated at 481 [131]-[133]:\\n \\n \\n '131. The pastoral leases which have affected the claim area in the present case are historical grants. The relevant extinguishment of native title rights and interests derives only from inconsistency with the rights historically conferred by those leases. No question of prospective activity under a subsisting pastoral lease arises. Consistently with what was said by Nicholson J in Daniel (No 2) and Sundberg J in Neowarra , the right to 'live' on the land can be interpreted as a right to live permanently on the land without any conflict with pastoral leaseholders' rights. That right does not necessarily involve permanent settlement at a particular place. The issue therefore reduces to the question whether a native title right of permanent settlement is inconsistent with a pastoral leaseholder's rights. There is no logical reason why it must be so. Just as the right to live permanently on the land does not necessarily give rise to inconsistency with the pastoral leaseholder's rights, neither does the right to erect a permanent structure. The existence of such a structure does not preclude a pastoralist's right to require its removal in the event that it conflicts with a proposed exercise by the pastoralist of a right under the lease. It is not inevitable that such a conflict will arise. \\n 132. The inconsistency posited by the Northern Territory in respect of the grant of historical pastoral leases long expired, is based on a theoretical conflict which would not inevitably have occurred. No inconsistency of rights giving rise to extinguishment of the native title right to live on the land and to erect permanent structures thereon is demonstrated. The concept of \\\"permanency\\\" referred to here is, in any event, a relative one. \\n 133. The right defined in par 3(b) to live on the land, to camp, to erect shelters and other structures, and to travel over and visit any part of the land and waters, should stand.'\\n\\n62 Accordingly, subject to the outcome of any appeal in Alyawarr , the State accepts that the determination proposed by the Yawuru claimants, which includes a native title right to live in the areas covered by pastoral leases, should stand.\\n\\n65 The passages relied upon by the parties must now be considered in the light of the Full Court decisions in Alyawarr and De Rose No 2 . As was pointed out in Alyawarr , a right to live upon the land does not necessarily involve permanent settlement at a particular place. Thus, even if a permanent structure was erected in pursuance of the right to live upon the land, that 'does not preclude a pastoralist's right to require its removal in the event that it conflicts with a proposed exercise by the pastoralist of a right under the lease': see Alyawarr at [131]. Their Honours added that it 'is not inevitable that such a conflict will arise'.\\n\\n66 The same reasoning applies to the exercise of the extensive range of rights conferred under a mining lease. A native title right to live on the land leased is not necessarily inconsistent with any of the rights conferred under a mining lease. In the event there is a necessary inconsistency, the lessee's rights will prevail. As is clear from the reasoning in De Rose No 2 , if the right under the lease was, for example, to erect improvements necessary for mining operations, the exercise of that right will extinguish any inconsistent native title rights (including the right to live on the land) in respect of the area on which the improvements have been constructed and any adjacent area necessary for their enjoyment. However, it is not suggested that there has been any exercise of rights that are inconsistent with a native title right to live on the areas the subject of the mining leases that are within the Yawuru claim area.\\n\\n67 Accordingly, I do not accept the State's contention that the rights conferred by the grant of the mining leases under the MA are necessarily inconsistent with, and therefore extinguish, a native title right to live on the leased land. However, the native title right to live on the leased land is qualitatively different from a native title right to live on land in respect of which the holders of the native title right have a right of exclusive possession because, in the latter case, the right of the holder is not subject to the risk of subsequent extinguishment.\\n\\n73 The more difficult question arising under ss 47A and 47B concerns the requirement that there be occupation of the relevant area. In Alyawarr at 496 ([193]-[195]), the Full Court discussed several cases which had considered that requirement:\\n \\n \\n '193. The requirement of occupation in s 47A of the NT Act, which is the same as that in s 47B, was considered by Beaumont and von Doussa JJ in Ward FC 1 . Their Honours considered that a broad view should be taken of the word (at [449]): \\n \\n\\n \\\"We think this requirement is met where a claimant member is one of many people who share occupancy, and that the land may be relevantly occupied even though the person is rarely present on the lands so long as the person makes use of the land for the reserved purpose as and when that person wishes to do so.\\\" \\n \\n \\n 194. In Rubibi Community v Western Australia [2001] FCA 607 ; (2001) 112 FCR 409, Merkel J found the following activities to evidence occupation of an area of land for the purposes of s 47A(1)(c) of the NT Act: \\n \\n\\n . continuing supervisory and protective activities of the senior Yawuru men in relation to the claim area; \\n \\n . the holding of traditional ceremonies on the claim area as and when the senior lawmen authorised those activities; \\n \\n . continued storage of sacred objects on the claim area; \\n \\n . occupancy of the Leregon structures constructed on the claim area by members of the Lee family who are acknowledged to be members of the Rubibi claim group. \\n \\n \\n In Passi v Queensland [2001] FCA 697 Black CJ, on a consent determination, said that although the islands the subject of that determination were not permanently inhabited the evidence showed that the Meriam people used the land as and when they wished. Its use was consistent with its reserved purpose. His Honour was satisfied that the people occupied the relevant islands. In Daniel at [973] Nicholson J also applied what Beaumont and von Doussa JJ had said in Ward FC 1 . He equated \\\"connection\\\" and \\\"occupation\\\". \\n 195. As Toohey J said in Mabo (No 2) at 188 presence on land does not have to be possession at law to amount to occupancy. He referred to United States and Canadian cases which established occupancy by reference to the demands of the land and society in question \\\"in accordance with the way of life, habits, customs and usages of the [indigenous people] who are its users and occupiers\\\" Sac and Fox Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma v United States (1967) 383 F 2d 991 at 998. His Honour observed in particular that \\\"... a nomadic lifestyle is not inconsistent with occupancy.\\\"'\\n\\n74 In reliance upon the cases referred to by the Full Court, the Yawuru claimants adduced extensive evidence of connection with, visits to and use of, numerous urban and bush areas within the Yawuru claim area. The evidence was relied upon by the Yawuru claimants to contend that the traditional connection with, and use of, the areas in question over a period of time by certain members of the claimant group constituted occupation of those areas at the relevant date. The Yawuru claimants even argued that they did not have to establish use because the entitlement I had found to exclusive possession of the Yawuru claim area (which was subject to the findings on extinguishment) was sufficient to constitute occupation. The argument is erroneous as it fails to distinguish between the criteria under s 223(1) of the NTA that must be satisfied in order to justify a finding of a native title right to exclusive occupation and the discrete requirement in ss 47A and 47B for occupation as a matter of fact.\\n\\n75 The State contended that the difficulty with the broad brush approach adopted by the Yawuru claimants is that it equates visits to and use of an area from time to time with occupation of that area. While use and visitation may be sufficient in some instances, each case will depend on its own facts.\\n\\n77 This approach has been accepted and followed in a number of other cases (see, for example, Daniel at [938], Alyawar at 496 [193] and Neowarra at [682]).\",\"14\":\"64 The Yawuru claimants disputed the State's contentions. They relied upon a later decision of RD Nicholson J in Daniel v State of Western Australia ([2003] FCA 1425 [23]-[25]) to contend that a mining lease is not relevantly distinguishable from a pastoral lease. Under both leases, so it was argued, a native title right to live on the land the subject of the lease is not inconsistent with the rights of the lessees under the relevant leases although the Yawuru claimants accepted that, upon the exercise of some of the lessee's rights, inconsistent native title rights and interests may be extinguished.\\n\\n80 RD Nicholson J adopted this approach in Daniel at [973] . Although it is not necessary to establish frequent use of the land, it is clear that frequency of the use of the land can be a relevant factor in determining whether or not there is occupation of that land.\\n\\n82 In Ward FC at 437 [449], use of the land for the reserved purpose was regarded as an indicator of occupation. In Daniel (at [973]), RD Nicholson J also regarded it as significant that the claimants made use of the land 'for its purpose as and when [they wished] to do so'. The references in the cases to the 'purpose' of the use, at least in relation to s 47A, indicate that a traditional use of the area, or a use that is consistent with the purpose of the reservation, being for the benefit of Aboriginal peoples, may be more likely to result in a finding of occupation of 'the area'. The reason for that was explained by Olney J in Hayes in the passage referred to above.\",\"15\":\"69 In Rubibi Community v Western Australia (No 4) [2004] FCA 1019 ; (2004) 138 FCR 536, I determined that the date 'when the application is made' is the date of the filing in the Court of the application for native title in respect of 'the area' referred to in ss 47A(1)(c) and 47B(1)(c). Plainly, 'the area' referred to in those sub-sections must be an area within the area the subject of a claimant application. However, as was explained by Sundberg J in Neowarra at [686] and [721], the area need not be the whole of the area claimed as that could lead to clearly unintended consequences in relation to the operation of ss 47A and 47B. Rather, the relevant area is the particular area with which each of the sections is concerned.\",\"16\":\"76 Although occupation is a question of fact involving matters of fact and degree, some general principles can be discerned from the cases. In Western Australia v Ward [2000] FCA 191 ; (2000) 99 FCR 316 (' Ward FC '), Beaumont and von Doussa JJ considered the meaning of the term 'occupy' in ss 47A and 47B and stated (at 437 [449]):\\n \\n 'A broad view should be taken of the word \\\"occupy\\\" in the requirement in s 47A(1)(c) that one or more members of the native title claim group occupy the area.'\",\"17\":\"81 In Hayes v Northern Territory [1999] FCA 1248 ; (1999) 97 FCR 32 (' Hayes ') at 144 ([162]), Olney J pointed out that, given the context in which s 47B was enacted (namely as part of Parliament's response to the decision in Wik Peoples v Queensland [1996] HCA 40 ; (1996) 187 CLR 1), the requirement for occupation of the land should be understood in the sense that the indigenous people had traditionally occupied the land, rather than in the sense of occupation according to common law principles. His Honour then stated at 144 [162] :\\n \\n 'The use of traditional country by members of the relevant claimant group which is neither random nor co-incidental but in accordance with the way of life, habits, customs and usages of the group is in the context of the legislation sufficient to indicate occupation of the land.' \\n\\nA similar approach was adopted by French J in Sampi at [1136].\\n\\n82 In Ward FC at 437 [449], use of the land for the reserved purpose was regarded as an indicator of occupation. In Daniel (at [973]), RD Nicholson J also regarded it as significant that the claimants made use of the land 'for its purpose as and when [they wished] to do so'. The references in the cases to the 'purpose' of the use, at least in relation to s 47A, indicate that a traditional use of the area, or a use that is consistent with the purpose of the reservation, being for the benefit of Aboriginal peoples, may be more likely to result in a finding of occupation of 'the area'. The reason for that was explained by Olney J in Hayes in the passage referred to above.\\n\\n84 The State argued that the kind of occupation contemplated by ss 47A and 47B was traditional occupation, in the sense of use of the land in accordance with traditional laws and customs, rather than random or co-incidental use. Whilst random or co-incidental use may be unlikely to constitute occupation, and traditional use may be more likely to constitute occupation, there is no proper basis for reading a requirement of traditional occupation into ss 47A and 47B. However, traditional use was successfully relied upon to establish occupation in Hayes and Daniel . Where the use is not traditional, the question remains whether the evidence about connection, use, habitation or visitation is sufficient to warrant a conclusion, as a matter of fact, that the requisite occupation has been established.\\n\\n85 Finally, it is not necessary for the occupation of the land to be exclusive or confined in fact to persons who are members of the claimant group. In Ward FC (at 437 [449]), Beaumont and von Doussa JJ noted that it was sufficient for the claim group member to be 'one of many people who share occupancy' and that occupation by non-claimant persons does not preclude the claimants from occupying the area. However, in my view, if the evidence establishes a similar non-traditional use of the relevant area by the general public, the fact that some members of the public using the area are claim group members is unlikely to be sufficient to justify a finding of occupation of the area by one or more claim group members. The Shire of Broome contended that, where the physical presence of a claim group member in an urban area is for a purpose and of a character that is indistinguishable from the physical presence of a member of the public, the presence should not be considered to be 'occupation' for the purposes of ss 47A or 47B. Although there is merit in the Shire's submission, I would not go so far as to accept it as a criterion for refusing to find the requisite occupation. However, general public use of the relevant area is a relevant, if not a determinative, factor. Ultimately, the question is whether the requisite occupation by a claim group member has been established.\\n\\n86 The Yawuru claimants argued that their traditional connection with the Yawuru claim area, or with specific areas, distinguishes the use of claim areas by claim group members from use by the general public. While that question is a matter for evidence, I do not accept that the connection contended for can be assumed in respect of use of public areas where the use of those areas by claim group members is not a use for a traditional activity and is not distinguishable from use of the areas by other members of the public.\\n\\n128 Although it was accepted by the parties that the resolution of the dispute involved matters of fact and degree, the State's submissions set out a number of useful examples and guidelines:\\n \\n 'In Hayes v Northern Territory [1999] FCA 1248 ; (1999) 97 FCR 32 ( Hayes ) at page 109 (xiv) Justice Olney found that \\\"it may well be inferred that 'recreation equipment' would be both a structure and a fixture.\\\" Again, at page 102 (viii), his Honour stated that \\\"... there is no evidence of any building or structure in the nature of a fixture other than possibly a fence ...\\\" Clearly Justice Olney regarded recreation equipment and fences as examples of structures that could be considered as public works for the purposes of the NTA .

Likewise, it cannot be said as a matter of generality that playground equipment or pine bollard fencing are not fixtures, as it will depend upon the intention of the person or persons who bring it onto the land. \\n \\n In Daniel v State of Western Australia [2003] FCA 666 at [1047] Nicholson J found that water tanks and sewerage and waste water treatment plants were public work previous exclusive possession acts. \\n \\n In Sampi at [1126] and [1148] his Honour Justice French found a radio site constructed by Telstra to be a public work previous exclusive possession act. \\n \\n As to major earthworks, the Explanatory Memorandum to the Native Title Bill 1993 gave as examples: \\n \\n \\n \\n \\\"... dams and weirs whose construction permanently and significantly disturbs or changes the land.\\\" \\n \\n \\n \\n Excluded from the examples given were digging wells, cultivating land for crops or establishing a walking trail in a National Park. \\n \\n ... \\n \\n In any event, as to the extent of the public works in each area, the First Respondent relies upon the decision of his Honour Justice Sundberg in Neowarra v State of Western Australia (No 1) [2003] FCA 1399 ; (2003) 134 FCR 208 ( Neowarra ) at [654] to [660] to the effect that: \\n \\n \\n \\n \\\"Section 251D [NTA] is specifically directed to public works, and is plainly intended to operate in conjunction with ss 23B(7) and 23C(2). There is no reason to deny its beneficial function of ensuring that a public work has the benefit of adjacent land that is necessary for or incidental to the operation of the work, especially in relation to access to landlocked works.\\\"'\",\"18\":\"97 I am not satisfied that his Honour was clearly wrong and, indeed, I am in agreement with his Honour's approach (cf Risk v Northern Territory of Australia [2006] FCA 404 at [881] ). The rules of the associations are not relevantly distinguishable from the rules considered by Sundberg J. It must follow that the property of each of the three associations is held by them expressly for the benefit of Aboriginal peoples.\",\"19\":\"123 The State contended, correctly in my view, that exclusive native title was not recognised in these areas under s 223(c) of the NTA . As a consequence, ss 47A and 47B cannot be relied upon to claim exclusive possession because the sections are concerned with past extinguishment, rather than non-recognition: see Gumana v Northern Territory of Australia [2005] FCA 50 at [263] .\\n\\n124 The State contended that past extinguishment by the exercise of the right to erect an improvement on a leasehold to which s 47A or s 47B applies, is not to be disregarded notwithstanding that the sections require the grant of the lease or prior interest to be disregarded. In my view, the contention is not correct because the past extinguishment only occurred by the grant of the lease or prior interest which conferred the right to construct the improvement. As is clear from De Rose No 2 at [157], the extinguishment arises from the grant of the lease and operates when the improvement is constructed. It follows that, if the grant of the lease or other prior interest is to be disregarded under s 47A or s 47B, there can be no extinguishing effect by the exercise of the right to construct the improvement.\\n\\n125 Public works that are category A past acts (s 229(4)) or previous exclusive possession acts (s 23B(7)) extinguish native title. A public work is defined in s 253 of the NTA to mean:\\n \\n \\n '(a) any of the following that is constructed or established by or on behalf of the Crown, or a local government body or other statutory authority of the Crown, in any of its capacities: \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n (i) a building, or other structure (including a memorial), that is a fixture; or \\n (ii) a road, railway or bridge; or \\n (iia) where the expression is used in or for the purposes of a Division 2 or 2A of Part 2 a stock-route; or \\n (iii) a well, or bore, for obtaining water; or \\n (iv) any major earthworks; or \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n (b) a building that is constructed with the authority of the Crown, other than on a lease.'\",\"20\":\"168 If settlements do not occur and native title claims have to be resolved in an adversarial proceeding, there remains the risk for the claimant community that native title may prove to be yet another of the prospects held out to indigenous communities where the realisable gain falls short of that originally expected as a result of the decision in Mabo v Queensland (No 2) [1992] HCA 23 ; (1992) 175 CLR 1. However, if compromises are able to be achieved, the cause of reconciliation between Australia's past and present will be greatly advanced and the economic, social and educational benefits available to all Australians may be better able to be accessed by members of claimant communities.\\n\\n169 There remains the question of how the present native title gridlock may be resolved by mediation. Plainly, some changes to the present system of mediation and resolution are necessary. The areas of possible change include:\\n \\n \\n (a) amending s 87 of the NTA to:\\n (i) make it quite clear that the requirement of agreement of parties to mediated outcome only applies to the parties whose interests are affected by the outcome (s 87 of the NTA ); \\n (ii) empower the Court to give effect to a mediated outcome of part of the claim when that is agreed to by all parties whose interests are affected by that outcome, leaving it to the remaining parties to contest the balance of the proceeding only insofar as their interests are affected by the outstanding and unresolved part of the claim; \\n \\n \\n (b) providing for formal and confidential offers of settlement to be made by parties in the course of mediation the offers may be presented to the trial court after a final determination has been made so that adverse costs consequences may follow for the parties for whom the final outcome was not greater than that offered in the mediation;\\n (c) greater emphasis being placed in mediation on case management and the narrowing of contested issues thereby reducing costs and enhancing the efficiency of the trial process;\\n (d) reviewing the guidelines for Commonwealth funding of NTA claims to include as one of the guidelines whether there has been a recommendation of a mediator that the funded party has made a bona fide and reasonable endeavour to resolve the dispute; \\n (e) each state party developing a mediated settlement model that may be used generally by the state party for mediated outcomes; and\\n (f) adopting a practice in mediation and in the Court of determining issues that have not been resolved by mediation at an early hearing such a practice will require the parties to finally decide to either settle or contest the native title claim.\\n\\n170 Hopefully, if notice is taken of the above observations, it might diminish the risk of, and the harm that can flow from, a final finding at an adversarial hearing that the 'tide of history' has washed away recognition of a community's native title under Australian law. It might also greatly advance the reconciliation between Australia's past and present.\\n \\n\\n I certify that the preceding one hundred and seventy (170) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Merkel. \\n\\nAssociate:\\n\\nDated: 28 April 2006 \\n\\n\\n Counsel for the Applicants: Mr R Blowes SC with\\nMr A Frith \\n \\n Solicitor for the Applicants: Kimberley Land Council \\n \\n Counsel for the State of Western Australia: Ms R Webb QC with\\nMr S Begg \\n \\n Solicitors for the State of Western Australia: Crown Solicitor for the State of Western Australia \\n \\n Counsel for the Commonwealth of Australia: Mr A Rorrison \\n \\n Solicitors for the Commonwealth of Australia: Australian Government Solicitors \\n \\n Counsel for the Western Australian Fishing Industry Council (Inc): Mr M McKenna \\n \\n Solicitors for the Western Australian Fishing Industry Council (Inc): Hunt and Humphry \\n \\n Appearing as a representative of the Walman Yawuru Respondents: Ms R Hanigan \\n \\n Solicitor for Shire of Broome: Mr PL Wittkuhn of McLeods \\n \\n Dates of further hearing: 4, 5, 6, 7 and 27 April 2006 \\n \\n Date of these Reasons: 28 April 2006 \\n\\n SCHEDULE \\n \\n\\n APPLICANTS: \\nCORPUS, Michael \\nDJIAGWEEN, Cecilia\\nDJIAGWEEN, Francis\\nDODSON, Patrick\\nEDGAR, Elsie\\nEDGAR, Felix\\nHUNTER, Richard\\nROE, Joseph\\nROE, Joseph 'Nipper'\\nROE, Teresa\\nSADDLER, Thelma\\nSEBASTIAN, Frank\\n\\n RESPONDENTS: \\n\\n 01 Government Interests State of Western Australia \\nAboriginal Affairs Department\\nAboriginal Lands Trust\\nCommissioner of Main Roads\\nElectricity Corporation\\nMinister for Aboriginal Affairs\\nMinister for Energy\\nMinister for Fisheries\\nMinister for Lands\\nMinister for Mines\\nMinister for Transport\\nMinister for Water Resources\\nState of Western Australia\\n\\n 02 Government Interests Commonwealth of Australia \\nAirservices Australia\\n\\n 02A Government Interests Commonwealth of Australia \\nCommonwealth of Australia\\n\\n 02A Government Interests Local Government \\nShire of Broome\\n\\n 04 Indigenous Interests \\nBilgungurr Aboriginal Corporation\\nKimberley Land Council\\nMATSUMOTO, Peter\\nROBINSON, Margaret Mary\\nROE, Edward Leonard\\n\\n 05 Mining Interests \\nCONNOLLY, Peter Scott\\nCOUNTY, Brian Stanley\\nMaple Oil Exploration NL (Administrators Appointed) (Receivers and Managers Appointed)\\n\\n 06 Pastoral Interests \\nCROOK, Reginald D\\nThangoo Pty Ltd (Thangoo Station)\\n\\n 07 Telecommunications Industry Interests \\nTelstra Corporation Limited\\n\\n 08 Tourism Interests \\nBroome Crocodile Park\\nCable Beach Jet Boat Charter\\nDampier Creek Boat Tours\\nKimberley Birdwatching\\nThe Kimberley Connection Pty Ltd\\n\\n 09 Fishing Interests \\nAustralian Ocean Exporters Pty Ltd\\nBLATCHFORD, Kevin\\nBroometime Charters\\nCANNEY, Pam\\nFRASER, Alan John\\nIGNOTI, Les\\nIGNOTI, Peter\\nIGNOTI, Russell\\nKimberley Fish and Ice Supplies\\nLenden Nominees Pty Ltd\\nLeveque Wilderness Fishing Charters\\nLEW, Ian\\nLITTLETON, Kyran R\\nMOORE, Gary\\nNEWTON, Ross\\nPearl Coast Charters\\nPearl Sea Coastal Cruises\\nWEIR, Neville\\n\\n 09A Fishing Interests \\nWestern Australian Fishing Industry Council (Inc)\\n\\n 10 Pearling Interests \\nAustralian Sea Pearls Pty Ltd\\nBroome Pearls Pty Ltd\\nCygnet Bay Pearls\\nPaspaley Pearling Company Pty Ltd\\nPearls Pty Ltd\\nRoebuck Pearl Producers Pty Ltd\\nWillie Creek Pearl Farm and Broome Coachlines\\n\\n 11 Petroleum Interests \\nE-Com Multi Limited\\n\\n 12 Non Party (For Information Only) \\nNational Native Title Tribunal\\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2006\\/459.html\"}}"
