The issues that separated the parties narrowed considerably during the course of yesterday's hearing. The remaining differences relate to the form of declaratory relief that is appropriate and the costs orders that should be made.\\n\\nAWB submitted that, where I have determined that documents attract privilege, wholly or partly, the Court should make a declaration to that effect. On the other hand, AWB submitted that, where I have determined that documents over which AWB claimed privilege do not attract privilege or that any privilege has been waived, I should not make a declaration to that effect. It submitted that any such declaration was unnecessary and would lack utility. Senior Counsel for AWB said, from the bar table, that the documents in question were being produced to the Commission. The relevance of this is dubious, as it follows the delivery of my reasons for judgment and, presumably, anticipates that final orders will be made that give effect to those reasons. AWB also pointed out that the Commonwealth had not mounted any cross-claim for declaratory relief in its favour.\",\"1\":\"The making of a declaration and the terms in which it should be framed are in the Court's discretion: Forster v Jododex Australia Pty Ltd [1972] HCA 61 ; (1972) 127 CLR 421 at 437-439 per Gibbs J; and Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission [1992] HCA 10 ; (1992) 175 CLR 564 ( 'Ainsworth' ) at 581-582 and 596-597. As a matter of substance, the dispute that AWB submitted to the Court for its adjudication was whether legal professional privilege did, or did not, attach to the documents in AWB's further revised list of privileged documents dated 7 August 2006 (as supplemented by letters from AWB's solicitors to the Court dated 25 August 2006 and 5 September 2006). In my opinion, any declarations made by the Court should reflect the final outcome of this case with certainty and precision. Moreover, it is desirable that there should be an authoritative resolution of the dispute presented to the Court.\",\"2\":\"The making of a declaration and the terms in which it should be framed are in the Court's discretion: Forster v Jododex Australia Pty Ltd [1972] HCA 61 ; (1972) 127 CLR 421 at 437-439 per Gibbs J; and Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission [1992] HCA 10 ; (1992) 175 CLR 564 ( 'Ainsworth' ) at 581-582 and 596-597.

Declaratory relief in this form is appropriate because it determines the legal controversy that was before the Court: see Ainsworth at 582 and 596-597; and Bass v Permanent Trustee Co Ltd [1999] HCA 9 ; (1999) 198 CLR 334 at 355-356. As AWB's application makes clear, the controversy includes the question whether the documents at issue are protected from production to the Commission by legal professional privilege. This controversy is only likely to be quelled, completely and finally, by making a declaration in the form I propose.\",\"3\":\"I have concluded that the Court should make a declaration, reflecting my reasons for judgment, that legal professional privilege attaches to specified documents, and does not attach to other specified documents.

AWB relied in particular on the following passage from Cretazzo v Lombardi (1975) 13 SASR 4 ( 'Cretazzo' ) where Jacobs J said at 16: \\n \\n 'But trials occur daily in which the party, who in the end is wholly or substantially successful, nevertheless fails along the way on particular issues of fact or law. The ultimate ends of justice may not be served if a party is dissuaded by the risk of costs from canvassing all issues, however doubtful, which might be material to the decision of the case. There are, of course, many factors affecting the exercise of the discretion as to costs in each case, including in particular, the severability of the issues, and no two cases are alike. I wish merely to lend no encouragement to any suggestion that a party against whom the judgment goes ought nevertheless to anticipate a favourable exercise of the judicial discretion as to costs in respect of issues upon which he may have succeeded, based merely on his success in those particular issues.' \\n\\n\\nIn short, AWB submitted that it achieved substantial success and that it should have the costs of the proceeding, notwithstanding its failure on the issues of waiver and the fraud exception.\\n\\nThe Commonwealth submitted that AWB should pay its costs of the proceedings. It argued that success in this case cannot be measured purely in numerical terms; rather a judgement ought to be made as to which party has had substantial success in the case, having regard to the significance of the issues decided by the Court in favour of one or other party. It added that a finding that privilege subsists in a large number of technical or peripheral documents cannot be weighed in the same scale.\\n\\nThe Court's discretion to order costs under s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) is unfettered, except that it must be exercised judicially. The usual order as to costs is that a successful party will have its costs paid on a party and party basis by the unsuccessful party: Colgate-Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Ltd (1993) 46 FCR 225 at 232-234. As the passage from Cretazzo indicates, the mere fact that a substantially successful applicant fails on particular issues of fact or law along the way may not afford an adequate ground for depriving that applicant of some or all of its costs. On the other hand, it lies within the Court's discretion to make a costs order that reflects the degree of success attained: Ruddock v Vadarlis (No 2) [2001] FCA 1865 ; (2001) 115 FCR 229 at 234-235 [11] and 236 [15]. Depending on the circumstances, it may be an appropriate exercise of the Court's discretion to deprive a party of its costs in respect of an issue which it lost at trial: Cummings v Lewis (1993) 41 FCR 559 at 599-604; and Dias Aluminium Products Pty Ltd v Ullrich Aluminium Pty Ltd (No 2) [2005] FCA 1400 at [3] . Alternatively, the Court can order a successful party to pay some costs in respect of unsuccessful aspects of the case: Hughes v Western Australian Cricket Association (Inc) (1986) ATPR 40-748 at 48,136; Forster v Farquhar (1893) 1 QB 564; and Inn Leisure Industries Pty Ltd v DF McCloy Pty Ltd (No 2) (1991) 28 FCR 172.\",\"5\":\"The Court's discretion to order costs under s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) is unfettered, except that it must be exercised judicially.

An allocation of costs in a case of mixed results can rarely if ever be done with mathematical precision: Dodds Family Investments Pty Ltd v Lane Industries Pty Ltd (1993) 26 IPR 261 at 272 per Gummow, French and Hill JJ.\\n\\nTaking a broad and overall view of the outcome of this case, I consider that both AWB and the Commonwealth achieved a substantial measure of success. I cannot agree with AWB's submission that, in material respects, it was the successful litigant. The Commonwealth succeeded on a number of very important issues. It established that privilege did not attach to numerous documents that are likely to be material to the issues being investigated by the Commission. AWB did not merely fail 'along the way' to prove particular issues of fact and law which, in the end, did not prevent it achieving substantial success; rather, AWB lost some of the most substantial issues that were litigated. Those issues involved more than half of the hearing time occupied by this case.\\n\\nIn all the circumstances, I consider that the just and appropriate order is that there be no order as to the costs of the proceeding. The result will be that AWB and the Commonwealth must each bear its own costs.\\n\\nI do not consider that there is any substance in the criticisms that AWB directed towards the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth was entitled to put AWB to the proof of its privilege claims. Nor do I agree with AWB's assertion that the description of the documents in AWB's lists was generally sufficient to enable the Commonwealth to form a view about the provenance of each document and the grounds upon which privilege was claimed.\\n\\nAWB also sought the costs of its notice of motion dated 19 June 2006 and the first respondent's notice of motion dated 24 July 2006. I have concluded that there should be no order as to the costs of these notices of motion.\"}}"
