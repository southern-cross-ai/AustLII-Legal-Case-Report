I incorporate that passage in these reasons.\\n\\n5 Mr McGregor identified 10 items where he disagreed with Ms Gourlay's assessment. With one exception, it seemed to me that Ms Gourlay had taken quite a conservative approach and that her opinion should be accepted. The one exception was in relation to expert witness fees where the fees paid were very much in excess of the scale rate. I thought the sum suggested by Ms Gourlay should be reduced by $33,000.\\n\\n6 The net result is that I assess the gross sum at $825,000. By way of a check, this sum is roughly half of the amount actually paid by Black & Decker, so that gives additional comfort that the gross sum assessed is not excessive.\",\"8\":\"10 The respondent, which vigorously prosecuted a cross-claim for revocation of Black & Decker's patents and design, can hardly complain that the present proceeding was commenced in a \\\"prescribed court\\\", being the only court in which a revocation proceeding could be brought: Patents Act s 138 ; see LED Builders Pty Ltd v Hope [1994] FCA 1353 ; (1994) 53 FCR 10 at [17] ; Australasian Performing Right Association Ltd v Metro on George Pty Ltd (2004) 64 IPR 57 at [8]-[9]; Sony Entertainment (Australia) Ltd v Smith [2005] FCA 228 ; (2005) 215 ALR 788 at [203] ; Axe Australasia Pty Ltd v Australume Pty Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 844 at [6] ; Tu v Pakway Australia Pty Ltd (2006) 227 ALR 287 at [32].\",\"9\":\"10 The respondent, which vigorously prosecuted a cross-claim for revocation of Black & Decker's patents and design, can hardly complain that the present proceeding was commenced in a \\\"prescribed court\\\", being the only court in which a revocation proceeding could be brought: Patents Act s 138 ; see LED Builders Pty Ltd v Hope [1994] FCA 1353 ; (1994) 53 FCR 10 at [17] ; Australasian Performing Right Association Ltd v Metro on George Pty Ltd (2004) 64 IPR 57 at [8]-[9]; Sony Entertainment (Australia) Ltd v Smith [2005] FCA 228 ; (2005) 215 ALR 788 at [203] ; Axe Australasia Pty Ltd v Australume Pty Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 844 at [6] ; Tu v Pakway Australia Pty Ltd (2006) 227 ALR 287 at [32].\"}}"
