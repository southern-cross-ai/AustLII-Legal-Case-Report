Alternative means could have been employed by EP. A photocopy of the first e-mail could have been sent by mail or hand delivered or sent by facsimile transmission. Each method is to the same effect: a copy of the original privileged communication would have been delivered to Mr Anderson. The language of s 118(a) is directed to prohibiting evidence being adduced that would result in disclosure of a confidential communication made between a client and a lawyer. To allow, for example, cross-examination of Mr Drummond, by senior counsel for Euroz, utilising the second e-mail, would inevitably result in evidence being adduced which would result in the disclosure, in whole or part, of the privileged communication in the first e-mail.\\n\\nThis reflects the position at common law as noted by the Full Court in Carnell v Mann at 254 when their Honours observed: \\n In principle, whether copies of original documents are privileged at common law should be determined by asking what was the purpose underlying the creation of those original documents , and not what was the purpose underlying the creation of the copies see Carlton Cranes Ltd v Consolidated Hotels Ltd [1988] 2 NZLR 555 at 557 per Tompkins J. ... \\n\\n \\n The better view, we think, is that, at common law, the mere act of copying a privileged document does not lead to loss of privilege in the copy simply because it was not created for a privileged purpose. In an era where so many documents are routinely copied, it would be peculiar to think that the existence of legal professional privilege in any given copy might depend upon the purpose underlying the making of that specific copy. (Emphasis added)\\n\\nIt cannot be said that there was an express obligation. However, the circumstances, in my opinion, give rise to an implied obligation upon Mr Anderson, viewed objectively, not to disclose the contents of the first e-mail contained in the second e-mail. It may be seen that such an obligation need not be one which \\\"arises under law\\\" by virtue of s 117(1). As the Court said in Carnell v Mann at 259 the Parliament must have had in mind relationships broader than those of (for example) solicitor\\/client when it enacted the definitions of \\\"confidential communication\\\", and \\\"confidential document\\\" in s 117(1).\\n\\nThe very content of the first e-mail which was copied in the second e-mail disclosed on its face, so far as Mr Drummond, objectively, might have considered, that it related to legal proceedings, actual or anticipated involving EP, Mr Bruce Drummond as one of its directors and inferentially Mr Graham Anderson as a potential witness or at least someone who might be in a position to assist in various ways with that litigation. Again, self-evidently, the first e-mail was addressed to at least one person at Slater & Gordon, a well-known Australian legal firm. It included information concerning the private financial affairs of EP. Furthermore, the second e-mail in the section directed to Mr Anderson shows the subject as \\\"FW: Addition to witness statement\\\". Accordingly, it was being sent and must be taken to have been received in the context of, at least, anticipated litigation. In my opinion, it is inconceivable that EP and Mr Anderson would have considered the communication of the second e-mail to be other than on a strictly confidential basis. Furthermore, I am satisfied that the relationship between EP and Mr Anderson was of a confidential nature. In addition to the other matters which I have mentioned such is the case generally as between a client and the client's accountant.\\n\\nI do not mention these matters with a view to attributing any particular purpose but rather to characterise the confidential nature of the communication. This is not to say that the purpose of the communication may not be relevant to the question whether it was a confidential communication but merely that it is neither necessary to nor determinative of the resolution of the question.\",\"1\":\"EP instituted proceedings against Euroz on 20 May 2008. The trial of these proceedings was listed to commence before Siopis J yesterday but by reason of this application did not commence until this morning. The privilege issue was referred to me, on an urgent basis, by Siopis J to be dealt with separately. It would have been preferable if an objection to the production of the second e-mail on the ground of privilege had been taken on the return of the subpoena: Hardie Finance Corporation Pty Ltd v CCD Australia Pty Ltd (1995) 67 FCR 594.\\n\\nAt the time that the second e-mail was sent proceedings had not been instituted although legal proceedings against Euroz were in contemplation by EP.\\n\\nThere were in fact two e-mails relevant to this matter which were sent on 17 April 2008. The first e-mail was from Mr Drummond, and was sent on EP's behalf to Ms Carita Kazakoff, a solicitor with Slater & Gordon Solicitors who were acting for EP. It was copied by e-mail to one M. Walter, also a solicitor with Slater & Gordon and P G Willis a barrister then retained on behalf of EP. The \\\"Subject\\\" of the first e-mail was expressed to be \\\"Addition to witness statement\\\".\",\"2\":\"As the majority of the High Court said to like effect in Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1999) 201 CLR 1 at [16] the outcome on the question of privilege did not turn upon the manner in which the content of the privileged communications was disclosed. The privilege attaches to the communications, not to the pieces of paper on which they were written. What was shown were copies of privileged communications. The question is whether the disclosure of the communications resulted in the loss of privilege.\\n\\nThe principal question in this application is, in my opinion, the same question identified by the High Court in Mann v Carnell at [1] namely whether the legal professional privilege was lost by a subsequent disclosure of those communications.\\n\\nThere is no suggestion here of any express waiver, nor would the evidence justify such a finding.\\n\\nSection 122(2) of the Act provides: \\n (2) Subject to subsection (5), this Division does not prevent the adducing of evidence if the client or party concerned has acted in a way that is inconsistent with the client or party objecting to the adducing of the evidence because it would result in a disclosure of a kind referred to in section 118 , 119 or 120 .\",\"3\":\"The second e-mail was no more than a re-communication of the privileged communication contained in the first e-mail. There is no need, in those circumstances, to ask whether the re-communication was made for a privileged purpose. That is the position at common law: Spotless Group Ltd v Premier Building and Consulting Group Pty Ltd [2006] VSCA 201 ; (2006) 16 VR 1 at [20] - [24] per Chernov JA with whom Warren CJ agreed. It also reflects that the proper approach in this case in under s 118 and not s 119.\"}}"
