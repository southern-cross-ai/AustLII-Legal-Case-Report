"{\"id\":{\"0\":\"c0\"},\"class\":{\"0\":\"related\"},\"tocase\":{\"0\":\"Dunstan v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (No 2) [2005] FCA 1885\"},\"text\":{\"0\":\"This application relates to a purported appeal from a decision of Mansfield J delivered on 21 December 2005 ( Dunstan v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (No 2) [2005] FCA 1885).\\n\\nOn 6 November 2006 I struck out the notice of appeal in ACD 4 of 2006 but granted leave to Mr Dunstan to re-plead by filing an amended notice of appeal on or before 2 February 2007, and the matter was stood over until today with costs reserved.\\n\\nI indicated to Mr Dunstan on that occasion that the notice of appeal simply did not comply with the Rules of Court in relation to the form and substance of such a document, and explained that it was fundamental that there be a notice of appeal in proper form. I then adverted to the fact that legal advice in a situation of this kind is very helpful, if not essential. I also mentioned the possibility of some pro bono assistance. I have given some consideration to that again but I do not think that it is appropriate to take any steps in relation to that. This is a very particular case which Mr Dunstan presented himself before the trial judge, and to bring anybody in to deal with this on a pro bono basis is, I think on reflection, not likely to be helpful.\"}}"
