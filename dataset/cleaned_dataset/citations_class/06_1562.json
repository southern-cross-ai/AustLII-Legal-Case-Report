Counsel for the appellants referred to observations of Hayne J in SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 215 ALR 162 at [192] that 'it is not right to see [an] applicant's appearance before the tribunal pursuant to s 425 ... as the focus or culmination of the review process. It is no more than one step in what otherwise is a predominantly documentary process'.\\n\\n43 The appellants also claimed that the Tribunal had breached s 359A of the Act. They rely on VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 206 ALR 471 at [41], in which Finn and Stone JJ said that, under s 424A of the Act, a provision applicable to the Refugee Review Tribunal ('RRT') which is similarly worded to s 359A, information which is integral to the reasoning process rejecting the applicant's claim, as a matter of fairness, must be disclosed to the applicant and the applicant must be told of its relevance to the review. The appellants submitted that the AIRC information fell within this category. The appellants further argued that the decision in SAAP, which also concerned s 424A, established that the duty in s 359A is strict. Therefore, unlike the procedural fairness claim, the appellants submitted that Mrs Lobo is not burdened with showing that she could have answered the material, and the issue of 'practical injustice' is irrelevant to the question of jurisdictional error.\\n\\n48 I assume that the appellants are correct in their submissions as to the denial to them of natural justice in relation to the wages material.
