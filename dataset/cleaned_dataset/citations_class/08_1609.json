The Minister did not oppose this course. It is not considered that such a direction would have facilitated the expeditious hearing and resolution of the proceeding. The matter first came before the Court on 13 October 2008. The Applicant was then in detention at Villawood Detention Centre and it was desirable to have his grievances resolved as quickly as was consistent with a proper resolution of the issues raised in his Notice of Appeal . It is the practice of this Court to hear such cases as quickly as possible: eg, Awan v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 594 at [42] , [2002] FCA 594 ; 120 FCR 1 at 11; SZLMA v Minister for Immigration & Citizenship [2008] FCA 69 at [1] .

That which is decisive against the Applicant is the fact that the Tribunal considered the entirety of the evidence, including the evidence as to the effect that the decision would have upon him. Subject to a proper application of Direction No 21 , the weight to be given to the considerations addressed is a matter for the Tribunal alone: cf Black v Minister for Immigration & Citizenship [2007] FCAFC 189 at [33] [37], [2007] FCAFC 189 ; 99 ALD 1 at 8 9; Tapel v Minister for Immigration & Citizenship [2008] FCA 857 at [27] .\",\"6\":\"16 The task to be undertaken by the Tribunal in the present proceeding -- as in other applications coming before it -- was essentially a consideration of the evidence adduced and the submissions advanced.

That task was one of determining the correct or preferable decision on the basis of the material then before the Tribunal: Drake v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1979) 46 FLR 409.

A comparable argument was advanced and rejected in Cockrell v Minister for Immigration & Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 160. The trial judge had there rejected the argument as follows:\\n [53] I do not think the Tribunal member was bound to consider hardship to the applicant himself.

Gray, Finn and Mansfield JJ relevantly concluded:\\n [31] Counsel for the appellant did not refer the Court to any other document, or transcript of evidence, in which any evidence or submission of hardship to the appellant was put before the Tribunal. Any evidence and submissions in support of the proposition that the appellant would suffer hardship is therefore vague, and is usually found in the context of assertions of hardship to others, particularly [his son]. It is difficult to see how the Tribunal could come to the conclusion that hardship to the appellant was a relevant factor, appropriate for it to take into account under cl 2.17 of Direction No 21. The specific mention in cl 2.17(c) of hardship to immediate family members lawfully resident in Australia tends to make it doubtful that hardship to the person cancellation of whose visa is being considered would be regarded as a relevant matter, at least in most cases. It must be assumed that the cancellation of a visa of a person who opposes that cancellation would cause that person hardship in any event. Unless a case of specific hardship were put before the decision-maker, it can hardly be expected that the decision-maker would take into account such a general consideration. To the extent to which hardship to the appellant by separation from [his son] is implicit in the cancellation of the appellant's visa, it is important that Direction No 21 only makes specific reference (in the circumstances of this case) to hardship to [his son]. It is at least implicit in the Tribunal's finding that the prospects of the appellant and [his son] developing a close relationship were doubtful that the Tribunal's view was that the appellant's removal to the United States would make no significant difference to his relationship with [his son], and therefore to any detriment he suffered from the absence of a such a relationship.\",\"8\":\"5 Although the decision of the Tribunal was not susceptible of appeal, original jurisdiction is conferred on this Court by s 476A(1)(b) and (2) to review the Tribunal's decision.

The Applicant was given an opportunity for the merits of his position to be considered. Regrettably for the Applicant, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal resolved the merits of his claims adversely to him.\\n\\n10 Even if there had been a failure to consider the impact upon the Applicant of a decision affirming the cancellation of his visa, it is not considered that any jurisdictional error would in any event have been committed by the Tribunal.\\n\\n42 Similarly, in Vu v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 12 , 101 ALD 454 Tamberlin J concluded:\\n [13] The second submission involved the assumption, as his Honour pointed out, that it was a relevant fact for the minister to consider whether Mr Vu could receive medical treatment, in particular methadone treatment, for his heroin addiction if he goes back to Vietnam. His Honour found that the minister was aware of that fact and took it into account when making her decision. We have grave doubts that any of the particular matters of hardship identified by Mr Vu, even if not taken into account by the minister, would show jurisdictional error in her decision. The minister clearly addressed both the issue of hardship generally and each of the topics to which the direction issued under s 499(1) of the Act required the decision-maker to consider when exercising discretion. The particular matters of hardship raised by Mr Vu are not matters which, either expressly or by necessary implication from s 501 of the Act, required the minister to have regard to each of them: see Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1981) 162 CLR 24 ; 66 ALR 299 ; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf (2001) 206 CLR 323 ; 180 ALR 1 ; 62 ALD 225 ; [2001] HCA 30. \\nNorth and Mansfield JJ agreed.\",\"16\":\"37 Also relevant to the making of that determination is a proper understanding as to the role played by a statutory requirement to provide reasons. A primary purpose in imposing such a requirement is to inform the parties as to why their evidence or arguments have prevailed or been rejected. Reasons provided by an administrative tribunal, it is well accepted, are not to be read with an eye keenly attuned to the perception of error: Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259. In a passage which is now oft-cited, Brennan CJ, Toohey, McHugh and Gummow JJ there made the following observations as to the proper role of a reviewing court when considering a statement of reasons provided by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal: \\n When the Full Court referred to \\\"beneficial construction\\\", it sought to adopt an approach mandated by a long series of cases, the best exemplar of which is Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic [1993] FCA 322 ; [(1993) 43 FCR 280]. In that case, a Full Court of the Federal Court (Neaves, French and Cooper JJ) collected authorities for various propositions as to the practical restraints on judicial review. It was said that a court should not be \\\"concerned with looseness in the language ... nor with unhappy phrasing\\\" of the reasons of an administrative decision-maker. The Court continued: \\\"The reasons for the decision under review are not to be construed minutely and finely with an eye keenly attuned to the perception of error.\\\" These propositions are well settled. They recognise the reality that the reasons of an administrative decision-maker are meant to inform and not to be scrutinised upon over-zealous judicial review by seeking to discern whether some inadequacy may be gleaned from the way in which the reasons are expressed. In the present context, any court reviewing a decision upon refugee status must beware of turning a review of the reasons of the decision-maker upon proper principles into a reconsideration of the merits of the decision. This has been made clear many times in this Court. ... (citations omitted) \\nSo construed, the reasons of the Tribunal in the present proceeding reveal a careful consideration of the evidence that was presented and a careful consideration of the case being advanced by the Applicant. No doubt because the Applicant was unrepresented, no clear submission was advanced that any particular aspect of hardship to the Applicant was a discrete matter which had to be separately addressed and resolved in any manner different to that set forth in the Tribunal's reasons. \\\" Hardship \\\", it must be recognised, is a matter which may manifest itself in any one of a number of different ways. To that extent, it is a state of indeterminate content. But no particular piece of evidence could be identified which gave rise to any particular aspect of \\\" hardship \\\" which was not addressed by the Tribunal in its reasons.\\n\\n38 Not surprisingly, the reasons of the Tribunal address the terms of Direction No 21. And, even though that Direction does not mention hardship to the Applicant as a matter specifically to be addressed, it was inevitable that a decision affirming the delegate's decision would operate to deny to him an ability to remain in Australia. His desire to remain was presumably the reason why he sought review by the Tribunal. Even though such reference as was made to the effect of the decision upon the Applicant may have been dealt with within the context of the Direction itself, hardship to the Applicant remained a matter taken into account by the Tribunal and adequately addressed by it in the reasons provided.\\n\\n39 The manner in which the Tribunal has resolved the evidence and submissions advanced before it, it is considered, does not expose the Tribunal to any sustainable contention that it failed to consider the hardship that affirming the decision under review would occasion the Applicant, nor to any sustainable contention that it failed to make those findings of fact material to the decision it made.\",\"17\":\"35 Having considered the evidence and the submissions advanced, and extended to the Applicant a \\\" reasonable opportunity \\\" to present his case, the remaining task of the Tribunal was that set forth in s 43(2B) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act , namely to make its findings on material questions of fact and refer to the evidence upon which those findings were based. That sub-section provides as follows:\\n Where the Tribunal gives in writing the reasons for its decision, those reasons shall include its findings on material questions of fact and a reference to the evidence or other material on which those findings were based. \\nThis provision does not require the Tribunal to set forth all findings of fact, but only those findings on \\\" material questions of fact \\\": cf Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 at [67] [68], [2001] HCA 30 ; 206 CLR 323 at 345 6. A more focussed submission in respect to hardship may have led the Tribunal to make a further finding. But the failure to make such a possible further finding does not expose reviewable error on the part of the Tribunal.\\n\\n36 When determining whether the reasons for decision of the Tribunal have adequately dealt with the particular legal and factual issues which were advanced before it, the Court must take into account a variety of factors. These include the comparative importance (or lack of importance) of any particular submission being advanced for determination and whether the evidence being presented raises any issue in need of resolution (even if not expressly the subject of a submission, especially in the case of an unrepresented party). In the present proceeding, and in accordance with Direction No 21, the Tribunal gave consideration to those matters which the Minister and the Government \\\" directed \\\" should be given \\\" particular importance \\\" and those matters which it directed should be given \\\" less individual weight \\\". Relevantly, \\\" hardship \\\" to a party whose visa was cancelled was not a matter specifically addressed by the Direction.\\n\\n42 Similarly, in Vu v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 12 , 101 ALD 454 Tamberlin J concluded:\\n [13] The second submission involved the assumption, as his Honour pointed out, that it was a relevant fact for the minister to consider whether Mr Vu could receive medical treatment, in particular methadone treatment, for his heroin addiction if he goes back to Vietnam.

It makes clear in the preamble that the exercise of the discretion whether or not to cancel the visas will take into account a wide range of factors including the protection and the expectations of the Australian community, the nature of the crimes committed, the non-citizen's links to Australia and any relevant international law obligations of Australia. The preamble went on to say that the purpose of refusing or cancelling a visa under s 501 is to protect the safety and welfare of the Australian community and to exercise a choice on behalf of the Australian community as a whole as to who should be allowed to enter or remain in the community. The task to prepare material for a consideration of such matters, objectively understood, is wide-reaching and significant. \\nGiven the terms of s 499(2A) , it was Direction No 21 which properly provided the structure for the Tribunal's reasons and its consideration of the evidence.\\n\\n24 Relevantly, Direction No 21 provides as follows:\\n 2.1 If a non-citizen does not pass the Character Test, decision-makers must have regard to the following considerations when exercising the discretion to decide whether or not the non-citizen should be permitted to enter or remain in Australia. ... 2.3 In making a decision whether to refuse or cancel a visa, there are three primary considerations: (a) the protection of the Australian community, and members of the community; (b) the expectations of the Australian community; and (c) in all cases involving a parental or other close relationship between a child or children and the person under consideration, the best interests of the child or children. ... 2.5 The factors relevant to an assessment of the level of risk to the community of the entry or continued stay of a non-citizen include: ... (c) whether visa refusal or cancellation may prevent or discourage similar conduct (general deterrence). ... 2.6 It is the Government's view that the following are examples of offences which are considered by the Government to be very serious: ... (f) ... assault or any other form of violence against persons; ... (l) serious theft (including \\\"white collar\\\" crimes): \\u2022 such crimes are of concern because of the amounts of money involved and\\/or the disruption caused to individuals, business and Government ... ... 2.11 General deterrence aims to deter other people from committing the same or a similar offence. While not a conclusive factor in itself, general deterrence is an important factor in determining whether to refuse or cancel a visa. The general deterrence factor may be relevant in a number of ways: (a) the nature of the offence may be such that visa refusal or cancellation may deter others from committing similar offences ... ... \\nThe Tribunal in the present proceeding addressed, as it was required to do, those matters set forth in Direction No 21 .\\n\\n25 Consistent with the Direction , the Tribunal addressed the three \\\" primary \\\" considerations set out in Direction No 21 , being:\\n \\n\\u2022 the protection of the Australian community, and members of the community;\\n \\n\\u2022 the expectations of the Australian community; and\\n \\n\\u2022 the best interests of the child.\",\"29\":\"33 The terms of Direction No 21 , and the requirements of s 39 , it may finally be noted, were considered by the Full Court in Scorgie v Minister for Immigration & Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 101.

And it is no part of the Tribunal's task to make out an applicant's case for him: cf Abebe v Commonwealth [1999] HCA 14 at [187] , [2004] HCA 32 ; 197 CLR 510 at 576 per Gummow and Hayne JJ.\\n\\n17 In determining the \\\" correct or preferable \\\" decision, the Tribunal will ordinarily be best \\\" guided by the parties \\\" in identifying the issues: Sullivan v Department of Transport (1970) 20 ALR 323 at 342. See also: A v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural Affairs [1999] FCA 227 at [36] per Katz J; NADB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCA 200 at [21] , [2002] FCA 200 ; 189 ALR 293 at 298 per Hely J. Deane J, with whom Fisher J agreed, further observed in Sullivan however that \\\"[c] ircumstances may ... arise in which ... a statutory tribunal, in the proper performance of its functions, will be obliged to raise issues which the parties do not wish to dispute \\\": (1978) 20 ALR 323 at 342. It is \\\" the duty of the Tribunal \\\", it has been said, \\\" to satisfy itself whether a decision in respect of which an application for review is duly instituted is a decision which in its view, was objectively, the right one to be made \\\": Drake v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1979) 46 FLR 409 at 429 30. Before the Tribunal there is no requirement that \\\" the point be taken \\\": Kuswardana v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1981) 54 FLR 334 at 348 per Fox J.\",\"32\":\"20 But it is not a line to be drawn so as to impose upon the Tribunal any general duty to itself secure evidence which has not been otherwise adduced or any general duty to pursue submissions not otherwise advanced. The need to inquire into facts not otherwise before the Tribunal may not be confined to those facts going to jurisdiction, as in Kuswardana ; but should be confined to facts of central importance to the decision to be made: cf Prasad v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1985] FCA 47 ; (1985) 6 FCR 155. And the need to consider submissions or issues not raised by the parties may equally normally be confined to those submissions which are submissions of substance which emerge from the factual material before the Tribunal: cf NABE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2004] FCAFC 263 , 144 FCR 1. It was said there that a \\\" judgment that the Tribunal has failed to consider a claim not expressly advanced is ... not lightly to be made. The claim must emerge clearly from the materials before the Tribunal \\\": at [68]. See also: SZITR v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1759 at [50] , [2006] FCA 1759 ; 44 AAR 382 at 397 per Moore J; MZXMG v Minister for Immigration & Citizenship [2007] FCA 1884 at [13] [14] per Middleton J. In MZXLB v Minister for Immigration & Citizenship [2007] FCA 1588 at [14] Finkelstein J referred to NABE and observed that there \\\" is no precise standard for determining when an issue is 'raised squarely', but it is clear the tribunal is obliged to consider any claim that is apparent on the face of the material before it \\\".\",\"33\":\"6 Although the constraint imposed by s 476A(1) cannot be disregarded, it did not appear that anything would have been gained had the Applicant been directed to file an application seeking judicial review as opposed to treating the Notice of Appeal as though it were such an application. The Minister did not oppose this course. It is not considered that such a direction would have facilitated the expeditious hearing and resolution of the proceeding. The matter first came before the Court on 13 October 2008. The Applicant was then in detention at Villawood Detention Centre and it was desirable to have his grievances resolved as quickly as was consistent with a proper resolution of the issues raised in his Notice of Appeal . It is the practice of this Court to hear such cases as quickly as possible: eg, Awan v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 594 at [42] , [2002] FCA 594 ; 120 FCR 1 at 11; SZLMA v Minister for Immigration & Citizenship [2008] FCA 69 at [1] . With the co-operation of those appearing for the Respondent Minister, arrangements were made to have the relevant evidence filed and served by 15 October 2008. The matter was listed for final hearing on 17 October 2008.\",\"34\":\"27 The fact that the Tribunal did not use the language of \\\" hardship \\\" that would be suffered by the Applicant -- as opposed to the \\\" hardship \\\" that would be occasioned to others -- it is considered, is not decisive. That which is decisive against the Applicant is the fact that the Tribunal considered the entirety of the evidence, including the evidence as to the effect that the decision would have upon him. Subject to a proper application of Direction No 21 , the weight to be given to the considerations addressed is a matter for the Tribunal alone: cf Black v Minister for Immigration & Citizenship [2007] FCAFC 189 at [33] [37], [2007] FCAFC 189 ; 99 ALD 1 at 8 9; Tapel v Minister for Immigration & Citizenship [2008] FCA 857 at [27] .\",\"35\":\"18 In determining the \\\" correct or preferable \\\" decision the Tribunal must also be satisfied that there is \\\" enough material \\\" before it on a matter of central importance to the decision to be reached ( Kuswardana v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1981) 54 FLR 334 at 343 per Bowen CJ). And \\\"[t] he tribunal [is] required to make the correct or preferable decision on the material before it, regardless of the form which the parties' submissions [take]\\\": McKeown v Repatriation Commission (1995) 39 ALD 30 at 33 per Jenkinson J. An error of law may be committed if the Tribunal ignores a central issue, even if no submission at all is directed to it: Australian Trade Commission v F & F Asia Pty Ltd (1996) 69 FCR 252 at 266 per Carr J. See also: Transport Accident Commission v Bausch (1998) 4 VR 249 at 263 per Tadgell JA (Batt and Buchanan JJA agreeing).\",\"36\":\"42 Similarly, in Vu v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 12 , 101 ALD 454 Tamberlin J concluded:\\n [13] The second submission involved the assumption, as his Honour pointed out, that it was a relevant fact for the minister to consider whether Mr Vu could receive medical treatment, in particular methadone treatment, for his heroin addiction if he goes back to Vietnam. His Honour found that the minister was aware of that fact and took it into account when making her decision. We have grave doubts that any of the particular matters of hardship identified by Mr Vu, even if not taken into account by the minister, would show jurisdictional error in her decision. The minister clearly addressed both the issue of hardship generally and each of the topics to which the direction issued under s 499(1) of the Act required the decision-maker to consider when exercising discretion. The particular matters of hardship raised by Mr Vu are not matters which, either expressly or by necessary implication from s 501 of the Act, required the minister to have regard to each of them: see Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1981) 162 CLR 24 ; 66 ALR 299 ; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf (2001) 206 CLR 323 ; 180 ALR 1 ; 62 ALD 225 ; [2001] HCA 30. \\nNorth and Mansfield JJ agreed.\",\"37\":\"33 The terms of Direction No 21 , and the requirements of s 39 , it may finally be noted, were considered by the Full Court in Scorgie v Minister for Immigration & Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 101. There was there held to be on the facts of that case no failure to comply with s 39. And in Weti v Minister for Immigration & Citizenship [2007] FCA 1531 there was no breach of s 39 occasioned by the Tribunal adjourning a proceeding on the application of an unrepresented applicant -- but only for one day. The applicant had there known of the unavailability of her solicitor for some time. The factual issues were said not to be complex and there were no legal issues. Edmonds J was there \\\" not persuaded that the Tribunal's decision to limit the adjournment of the proceedings to one day, resulting in the almost inevitable consequence that she would not be legally represented at the hearing on the following day, constitutes a denial of natural justice or procedural fairness in the form of a failure to provide her with a reasonable opportunity to adequately present her case \\\": [2007] FCA 1531 at [38] .\"}}"
