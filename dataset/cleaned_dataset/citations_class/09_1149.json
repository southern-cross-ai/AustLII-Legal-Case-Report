The applicant accepted that the above formulation of the matters which the applicant seeks to raise on appeal from the Tribunal captures the essence of the applicant's case on appeal.\\n\\nSection 14 of the Act provides that Comcare is liable to pay compensation in respect of an injury suffered by an employee if the injury results in death, incapacity for work or impairment.\",\"1\":\"The applicant did argue before the Tribunal that his underlying condition had been aggravated by his employment in the sense contemplated by the definitions in s 4 of the Act.

The Tribunal was obliged to turn its mind to the argument and to deal with the question of aggravation. It was a significant part of the applicant's case before the Tribunal.

At this point in its reasons, it referred to and discussed the judgment of Finn J in Comcare v Sahu-Khan [2007] FCA 15 ; (2007) 156 FCR 536.\\n\\nThe Tribunal then concluded its Reasons with the following (at [60]): \\n \\n After considering all the evidence, in particular the possible factors that may have contributed to the onset or aggravation of the Applicant's psychiatric condition, we find that the circumstances of the Applicant's employment with Centrelink did not substantially contribute to his disease. Mr Nelson is not entitled to compensation pursuant to section 14 of the Act. It follows that he is not entitled to compensation in respect of medical expenses under section 16, nor is he entitled to compensation for incapacity under sections 19 , 20 , 21 or 21A of the Act.\\n\\nThe only places that the concept of \\\" aggravation of an ailment \\\" were mentioned at all in the Tribunal's Reasons was at [5] (when s 4 of the Act was extracted) and at [60].\\n\\nIn the present case, in order to make good the contention concerning aggravation of an existing ailment which the applicant submits was advanced to the Tribunal, the applicant would need to demonstrate that, at the time he commenced his employment with Centrelink, he was suffering an ailment within the relevant definition and that that ailment was aggravated (ie made more severe) by his employment by Centrelink or that the aggravation was contributed to in a material degree by his employment by Centrelink. The notion of material contribution was explained by Finn J in Sahu-Khan [2007] FCA 15 ; 156 FCR 536. In that case, his Honour concluded that, in order to assess whether the aggravation of an ailment was contributed to in a material degree by the employee's employment, the Court was obliged to evaluate all relevant contributing factors in order to determine whether the employment made a contribution which was more than a mere contributing factor. His Honour described the exercise as a matter of fact and degree ( Sahu-Khan [2007] FCA 15 ; 156 FCR 536 at [16] (p 542 543)).\\n\\nThe fundamental premise of the applicant's argument is that the Tribunal simply failed to address his case based upon alleged aggravation of an existing ailment (viz his underlying psychiatric condition).\\n\\nThe Tribunal described the applicant's complaint at [1] of its Reasons as a complaint to the effect that his psychological condition was sustained because of his employment. That language tends to suggest that the Tribunal regarded the applicant's case as being confined to a case based upon the contention that he sustained an ailment as an employee of Centrelink, being an ailment that was contributed to in a material degree by Centrelink. The terms of the general formulation of the issue in [1] of the Tribunal's Reasons tend to suggest that the Tribunal did not regard aggravation of an existing ailment as being an alternative basis for the applicant's claims before it.\",\"4\":\"The applicant did argue before the Tribunal that his underlying condition had been aggravated by his employment in the sense contemplated by the definitions in s 4 of the Act.
