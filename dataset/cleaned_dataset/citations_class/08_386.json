Their Honours quoted from the then current edition of the seminal work on the law of contempt, Borrie & Lowe's Law of Contempt (2 nd ed, 1983): if a court lacked the means to enforce its orders, or if its orders could be disobeyed with impunity, the administration of justice would be brought into disrepute.\",\"4\":\"14 In BHP Steel (AIS) Pty Limited v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2001] FCA 336 , Kiefel J said at [3]:\\n \\n Penalties for contempt of Court orders necessarily recognise that the Court's authority must be vindicated, and that there is a public interest in compliance with all orders of the Court: Witham v Holloway [1995] HCA 3 ; (1995) 183 CLR 525 , 533 . Orders for penalties recognise the need to deter not only the defaulting party, but others who might be like-minded.\\n\\n53 In BHP Steel , Kiefel J observed at [22] that persons who prosecute contempt cases are often recognised as performing a public duty and an order for indemnity costs is made so that they are not out of pocket in taking that role.\\n\\n56 As Sir Robert Megarry VC said in EMI Records at 984, indemnity costs are commonly ordered in contempt cases.

The offence involves interference with the effective administration of justice, by impeding and perverting its course: Johnson v Grant (1923) SC 789 at 790 per Lord President Clyde.

Nevertheless, a number of relevant principles are to be found in their Honours' analysis of the distinction that was previously thought to underlie the difference between the civil and criminal species of contempt.\\n\\n8 First, disobedience to a court order or breach of an undertaking to a court amounts to a criminal contempt if it involves deliberate defiance or is contumacious: Witham v Holloway at 530. A contempt which is characterised in this way is therefore at the more serious end of the spectrum, although any contempt is a serious matter.\\n\\n9 Second, proceedings for breach of an order or undertaking have the effect of vindicating judicial authority, and a remedial or coercive effect: Witham v Holloway at 533.\\n\\n10 Third, as was earlier observed by the High Court in Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union v Mudginberri Station Proprietary Limited (\\\"Mudginberri\\\") [1986] HCA 46 ; (1986) 161 CLR 98 at 108, the punitive and remedial objects of the exercise of the contempt power are inextricably intertwined: Witham v Holloway at 533-534.\\n\\n14 In BHP Steel (AIS) Pty Limited v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2001] FCA 336 , Kiefel J said at [3]:\\n \\n Penalties for contempt of Court orders necessarily recognise that the Court's authority must be vindicated, and that there is a public interest in compliance with all orders of the Court: Witham v Holloway [1995] HCA 3 ; (1995) 183 CLR 525 , 533 .
