That was the case in relation to each of Bartlett and Singh (re Vending Machines) and Bowen (re Swisscom). Bartlett entered into the agreement himself, and the company was collateral to that agreement. Singh initially signed the agreement himself, and the early expenses were paid personally but there was a later novation to Perfect Communications Pty Limited. A second agreement was signed by Singh in person. The Swisscom agreement was signed by the Bowens personally. There is no evidence to suggest that any of the companies involved in these cases included external shareholders or carried on any separate businesses that could not be segregated from the company or of the subject businesses.

Despite submissions to the contrary by counsel for the ACCC, in my opinion that decision settled those questions for the purposes of a single judge, with one possible qualification. The reasoning of the Full Court appears as follows (at [10] [15]):\\n \\n 'From the interaction of these provisions three conclusions emerge. First, s 51A does not detract from the Yorke principle that actual knowledge of the essential elements of the contravention is required if s 75B or s 80 is to apply. Where the contravening conduct involves misrepresentation, whether as to a future matter or not, this principle requires actual knowledge by the accessorial respondent of the falsity of the representation. This is an essential matter which must be alleged and proved: Su v Direct Flights International Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 78 at [38] , Fernandez v Glev Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1859 at [18] . \\n Secondly, the reversal of onus in s 51A(2) does not apply where the accessorial liability of s 75B or s 80 is relied on. \\n ... \\n Thirdly, it is implicit in s 51A(1) that where a corporation does have reasonable grounds for making a representation with respect to a future matter then there will be no contravention of s 52. \\n ... \\n Accordingly, where s 75B or s 80 accessorial liability is in issue in relation to a representation with respect to a future matter, the existence or otherwise of reasonable grounds will be relevant. If reasonable grounds exist, there will have been no contravention and thus no question of accessorial liability will arise. However, as against the accessorial respondent, the onus will be on the applicant to show the respondent had actual knowledge that \\n \\n \\u2022 the representation was made and \\n \\u2022 it was misleading or \\n \\u2022 the corporation had no reasonable grounds for making it \\n \\n (See Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Michigan Group Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 1439 at [303] .)'\\n\\n46 The qualification is that in a case such as the present, where the corporations are parties, there is an argument available that the liability of the corporation should be decided in accordance with s 51A for all purposes including assessment of accessorial liability.\",\"20\":\"47 That does not alter the requirements for proof of accessorial liability (see Yorke v Lucas [1985] HCA 65 ; (1985) 158 CLR 661; Rural Press Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2002] FCAFC 213 ; (2002) 118 FCR 236 at [154] [160]; Medical Benefits Fund of Australia Ltd v Cassidy [2003] FCAFC 289 ; (2003) 135 FCR 1 per Stone J at [66] [93]).

I accept that the conduct did take place, and would infer that the false references were for the purpose of buttressing the representations made. That would assist in drawing the inference that those involved knew that the representations had been made and were false.\",\"24\":\"48 There is surprisingly little authority upon the provision in question.
