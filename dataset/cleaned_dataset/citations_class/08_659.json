Nonetheless, s 85A acknowledges that the Court has an overriding discretion as to costs and does not expressly impose a limit on the scope of the discretion. They said that there was no requirement that a threshold condition be met before the Court is empowered to make a costs order. Thus, the exercise of the discretion under s 85A(1) does not require a finding of a fact or the formation of an opinion that there has been unreasonable conduct or that special circumstances exist.\",\"1\":\"23 However, they held that s 85A(2) of the Act puts beyond doubt the extent of the Court's discretion in cases where a party has acted unreasonably.

He gave that section a wide construction on its plain and natural meaning: Paras 152 FCR at 538 [16]. But Young J held that the applicant for the order had to satisfy the Court that, relevantly, the other party's conduct 'involved unreasonable acts or omissions that caused the [party applying for the order] to incur costs': Paras 152 FCR at 539 [19].\\n\\n28 At the hearing of the costs argument, counsel for the Birri-Gubba People argued that in preparing a matter for trial, the litigious landscape often changes. He pointed to the fact that it could be expected in ordinary litigation that some issues which were hotly contested at an interlocutory stage might fall away by the time of the trial as minds became focused on the real issues. And, he pointed out that since at least March 2007 all parties had been on notice that the description of the claim group would have to change in light of the latest anthropological research obtained by Birri-Gubba People as to the correct identity of the persons who could claim native title over the relevant lands and waters in the vicinity of Cape Upstart. Counsel for the Birri-Gubba People also argued that there were practical problems with the funding available to the land council.\\n\\n29 The land council is presently the representative body under the Native Title Act . It was entitled to prioritise and make determinations as to the funding, staff, resources and complexity of this matter as one of a number for which it was responsible. Counsel argued that there was no basis on which the Court's discretion under s 85A of the Native Title Act was enlivened to warrant the making of a costs order against the Birri-Gubba People. He argued that the jurisdiction to award costs under s 85A should be only be exercised in circumstances where there were special or unusual features of the case, or where there had been conduct in the nature of an abuse of process, improper purpose, contempt or unreasonableness. In essence, that argument sought to confine the Court's power to award costs to circumstances which would warrant an order for costs on an indemnity basis in ordinary civil litigation (that is, in litigation where the Court's power to award costs does not have the constraint of s 85A(1) of the Act).\",\"5\":\"24 It is inappropriate to read a provision, such as s 43(2) of the Federal Court of Australia Act , which confers jurisdiction on, or grants powers to, a court, by making conditions or imposing limitations which are not to be found in the words used: Oshlack v Richmond River Council [1998] HCA 11 ; (1998) 193 CLR 72 at 81 [21] per Gaudron and Gummow JJ; see also Owners of \\\"Shin Kobe Maru\\\" v Empire Shipping Co Inc [1994] HCA 5 ; (1994) 181 CLR 404 at 421.

It is not to punish parties for mistakes they make in the conduct of their cases. Thus, the courts have developed principles as to when amendments may be made to pleadings to raise or change the form of the litigation, even at very late stages, provided that the other party can be compensated by an appropriate order for costs: Queensland v JL Holdings Pty Limited [1997] HCA 1 ; (1997) 189 CLR 146 at 152-155 per Dawson, Gaudron and McHugh JJ.\\n\\n37 I consider that it was unreasonable of the Birri Gubba People to present a total of five lists, none of which, on final consideration, produced even one person whom they wished to call. The Birri Gubba People were represented by lawyers and the land council at all times. They were not in the position of litigants in person unable to make informed forensic judgments or to properly present their case to the Court. On the evidence before me, no proper, considered attention was given to the inclusion of any of the persons in the five lists that were provided by the Birri Gubba People for the purposes of identifying whose evidence ought be preserved. This is evident from the fact that the end result is that no such witness has been identified, although one person who was clearly an appropriate witness, has unfortunately passed away in the meantime.\\n\\n38 On a number of occasions in open court the state of preparation of the land council was disclosed as being in disarray. I have no doubt that there was a sincere attempt to identify persons whose evidence might need to be taken on a number of occasions. But the attempt does not appear to have been undertaken by a lawyer familiar with litigation or with a view to determining whether or not any of those persons ought to be called to give evidence and what evidence he or she could give until, ultimately, the forensic decision was taken not to call any of them.\",\"7\":\"23 However, they held that s 85A(2) of the Act puts beyond doubt the extent of the Court's discretion in cases where a party has acted unreasonably.
