I accept that the language of the Rule allows that additional discovery may be ordered on the basis that it may lead to a train of inquiry: Spyer v Cuddles 'N' Mum (Franchise) Pty Ltd (No 3) [2002] FCA 1563. It is not appropriate, as a matter of routine, to require a wider range of discovery under O 15 r 8. In this respect I do not accept that additional discovery under the so-called Peruvian Guano test is routinely available. By that I refer to the test mentioned in Compagnie Financiere et Commerciale du Pacifique v Peruvian Guano Company (1882) 11 QBD 55.\\n\\n8 The rulings which follow refer to the classes of documents in relation to which discovery has not been given. They are as follows: \\n Paragraph in the Motion Ruling \\n1(a) Discovery allowed. \\n1(c) Discovery allowed.\\n \\n1(d) Discovery declined chain of inquiry justification insufficient. \\n \\n1(e) Discovery declined class of documents not defined by reference to relevance. Chain of inquiry insufficient.\\n \\n2(a) Discovery allowed, limited to documents evidencing the purchase and\\/or payment by the second respondent for product labels for the sale of automotive products exported by the second respondent to the sixth respondent and\\/or Gold Leaf Products Co Ltd for the period 12 February 2004 to 31 January 2005.\\n \\n2(b) Discovery declined relevance not established.\\n \\n2(d) Discovery allowed.\\n \\n2(e) Discovery declined relevance not established. \\n \\n2(f) Discovery allowed, limited to labels proof read at the meeting of 1 March 2004.\\n \\n2(i) Discovery declined class not defined by reference to criteria of relevance.\\n \\n2(j) Discovery declined class not defined by reference to criteria of relevance. \\n \\n2(k)(i), (ii), (viii) to (xi) Discovery declined, relevance not established.\\n \\n2(l) Discovery allowed. \\n \\n2(n) Discovery declined claim not defined by criteria of relevance.\\n \\n3(a) Discovery allowed.\\n \\n3(b) Discovery allowed. \\n \\n3(c) Discovery declined.\\n \\n3(d) Discovery declined. \\n \\n3(e) Discovery allowed.\\n \\n4(a) Discovery allowed.\\n\\n9 I will make orders to give effect to these rulings. I will not direct that the respondents revisit their earlier discovery with separate affidavits. The costs of the motion so far as it related to particular discovery will be costs in the cause. \\n\\n\\n I certify that the preceding nine (9) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice French. \\n\\n\\n Associate:\\nDated: 17 August 2007\\n\\n\\n Counsel for the Applicant: Mr G Rabe \\n \\n Solicitor for the Applicant: Stables Scott \\n \\n Counsel for the Respondent: Mr R Grayden \\n \\n Solicitor for the Respondent: Hammond Worthington \\n \\n Dates of Submissions: 23 and 31 July 2007 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 17 August 2007 \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2007\\/1259.html\"}}"
