Secondly it is necessary to identify a 'distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference' and thirdly to establish that such distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference was 'based upon' race. To prove the last mentioned matter it is essential to determine a causal connection between race and the impugned act: see Aboriginal Legal Rights Movement Inc v South Australia and Another (No 1) (1995) 64 SASR 551 at 553, where Doyle CJ, with whom Bollen J agreed, said:\\n \\n 'The inquiry is into whether the racial distinction is a material factor in the making of the relevant decision or the performing of the relevant act.'\",\"1\":\"64 Whether the discrimination is 'based upon' racial distinction has been held to mean whether the discrimination is ' by reference to ' a person's race: see Macedonian Teachers' Association of Victoria Inc v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and Another (1998) 91 FCR 8 (affirmed by the Full Court: see Victoria v Macedonian Teachers' Association of Victoria Inc and Another [1999] FCA 1287 ; (1999) 91 FCR 47).

His Honour said:\\n \\n 'Section 105 provides a means of bringing about lawful conduct by rendering liable a person who could prevent unlawful conduct from occurring or continuing or who assists, directly or indirectly, in its performance. A person can prevent unlawful conduct by not creating a situation where it will or may take place or altering a situation so it will not continue.'\\n\\n88 Since the President could not have been in a position to prevent any alleged unlawful conduct from occurring, it is apparent that s 105 can have no application in relation to him in resect of his decision to terminate the complaints of Ms Obieta for the reason that they were lacking in substance. Further, the President is not a party to the present proceedings and was not named as a respondent to Ms Obieta's complaint terminated on 3 March 2006. As such a claim made by Ms Obieta against the President cannot be maintained in these proceedings.\\n\\n89 For the above reasons the Court will order that the proceedings be dismissed and that Ms Obieta pay the costs of the Commission.\\n\\n\\n I certify that the preceding eighty-nine (89) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Cowdroy. \\n\\n\\n Associate:\\n\\n Dated: 7 February 2007\\n\\n\\n Counsel for the Applicant The Applicant appeared in person \\n \\n Counsel for the Respondent: Kate Eastman \\n \\n Solicitor for the Respondent: Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission \\n \\n Date of Hearing: 27 October and 3 November 2006 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 7 February 2007 \\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2007\\/85.html\",\"4\":\"64 Whether the discrimination is 'based upon' racial distinction has been held to mean whether the discrimination is ' by reference to ' a person's race: see Macedonian Teachers' Association of Victoria Inc v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and Another (1998) 91 FCR 8 (affirmed by the Full Court: see Victoria v Macedonian Teachers' Association of Victoria Inc and Another [1999] FCA 1287 ; (1999) 91 FCR 47). Findings to the same effect have been made in other courts: see Baird and Others v Queensland (No 1) (2005) 224 ALR 541; Commonwealth v McEvoy and Another [1999] FCA 105 ; (1999) 94 FCR 341.\",\"5\":\"35 An infringement of an Article in an International Convention referred to in Schedules to the RDA, SDA and HREOC Act does not give rise to a breach of the Act: see Minister of State for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Ah Hin Teoh [1995] HCA 20 ; (1995) 183 CLR 273. Accordingly the Court will not refer to the Articles of the International Conventions which were allegedly breached since no enforceable rights are created by them. Similarly, no cause of action arises in respect of alleged breaches of sections which are purely definitional or explanatory relied upon by Ms Obieta. Accordingly the Court will not refer to such sections.\\n\\n36 Ms Obieta claims that Ms Aylett and Ms Toohey rejected her complaint against Ms Fogarty without reviewing and assessing her submission dated 1 September 2005. As such Ms Obieta claims that Ms Aylett and Ms Toohey denied her 'natural justice' in handling her complaint, violated her human right to be heard on an equal footing with other parties or Australian respondents, and that she was treated unfairly. She alleges a breach of s 9 and s 10 of the RDA.\\n\\n37 Ms Obieta submits that the letter of the Commission to her dated 17 January 2006, which addresses her concerns relating to Ms Fogarty, refers to the original complaint relating to Ms Fogarty and submission of 20 July 2005 but does not refer to her letter of 1 September 2005. She submits this further demonstrates that the Commission failed to take into account such letter.\",\"6\":\"81 The Full Court observed in SCAS v Minister for Immigration ad Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 397 at [19] :\\n \\n 'Bad faith in this context implies a lack of an honest or genuine attempt to undertake the task and involves a personal attack on the honesty of the decision maker'. \\n\\nNo evidence has been provided in support of Ms Obieta's allegation of bad faith and the Court is not satisfied that the President handled Ms Obieta's complaint other than in a genuine and appropriate manner. Additionally, no complaint has been accepted by the Commission concerning the President's conduct.\\n\\n82 It follows that this Court has no jurisdiction under Part IIB of the HREOC Act and accordingly the Court upholds the submission that the complaint of race discrimination cannot be substantiated and must be dismissed.\\n\\n83 Ms Obieta claims that the exercise of the President's powers under s 46PH of the HREOC Act included victimisation within the meaning of s 94 of the SDA; and conduct that ' causes, instructs, induces, aids or permits' the respondents in the TAFE proceedings to discriminate against Ms Obieta on the ground of sex within the meaning of s 105 of the SDA.\",\"7\":\"56 The Commission refers to the decision of Kenny J in Spalla v St George Motor Finance Ltd (No 7) [2006] FCA 1177 at [166] which recently considered the general principles for determining whether an action may be done other than in good faith. Kenny J emphasised that an allegation of bad faith is a ' serious allegation involving the imputation of moral turpitude '. At [168], Her Honour said:\\n \\n '...The focus of an inquiry concerning an allegation of bad faith is the state of mind of the decision-maker. The Court is not simply evaluating the wisdom of an impugned decision... \\\"mere error or irrationality does not of itself demonstrate lack of good faith...[b]ad faith is not to be found simply because of poor decision-making\\\": SBBS at 756 [45] . Rather the circumstances must show dishonesty (or capriciousness) on the part of the decision-maker... Something is done in \\\"good faith\\\" when done honestly. Something is done in \\\"bad faith\\\" when done dishonestly.'\\n\\n57 The Commission submits that Ms Obieta's application to the Court under s 46PO of the HREOC Act constitutes 'an action or proceeding'; that all of the alleged acts were done in the performance of functions conferred on the Commission by the HREOC Act in relation to accepting, investigating and terminating complaints; that Ms Obieta seeks damages with respect to the alleged acts of discrimination; that there is no evidence to show that the actions of the Commission, the President or the officers were anything other than honest; and that Ms Obieta has adduced no evidence to demonstrate bad faith on the part of an employee of the Commission or the President.\\n\\n58 In cross-examination Ms Obieta said that she relied on the terms of the letter dated 3 March 2006 from the President of the Commission advising her that the complaints had been terminated, as evidence of bad faith.\",\"8\":\"64 Whether the discrimination is 'based upon' racial distinction has been held to mean whether the discrimination is ' by reference to ' a person's race: see Macedonian Teachers' Association of Victoria Inc v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and Another (1998) 91 FCR 8 (affirmed by the Full Court: see Victoria v Macedonian Teachers' Association of Victoria Inc and Another [1999] FCA 1287 ; (1999) 91 FCR 47).
