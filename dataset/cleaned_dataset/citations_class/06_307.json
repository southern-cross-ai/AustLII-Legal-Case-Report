It was not in dispute that the applicant failed to pass the \\\"character test\\\" because he had a \\\"substantial criminal record\\\": s 501(6)(a) ,(7)(c). The Minister nevertheless had a discretion to refuse to cancel the visa and the delegate was subject to ministerial directions under s 499.\\n\\n2 On 3 December 2003 the applicant was convicted by a jury in the Supreme Court of Tasmania of attempting to murder his wife Ann Flowers. He was sentenced to imprisonment for a period of four and a half years with parol eligibility after two years three months.\\n\\n3 At the trial Mrs Flowers gave evidence that on the evening of 9 May 2003 she returned to the matrimonial home at about 7.55 pm and found her husband waiting inside. He appeared to have been drinking heavily. She went to the bedroom and lay on the bed reading a magazine. Shortly afterwards the applicant entered, picked up a loaded gun which was kept in the bedroom, and said to her\\n \\\"I've been waiting all day for you you bitch you are going to die you bitch.\\\"\",\"1\":\"6 In the context of decisions under s 501 it was not open to the applicant to challenge his conviction or the essential facts giving rise thereto: Luu v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [1998] FCA 1021 , Bridges v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2001] FCAFC 1647.\",\"2\":\"6 In the context of decisions under s 501 it was not open to the applicant to challenge his conviction or the essential facts giving rise thereto: Luu v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [1998] FCA 1021 , Bridges v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2001] FCAFC 1647.\",\"3\":\"20 Senior counsel for the applicant submitted that there was jurisdictional error in that the decision of the Tribunal was so unreasonable that no reasonable decision-maker could make it ( Associated Provincial Picture Houses Limited v Wednesbury Corporation [1947] EWCA Civ 1 ; [1948] 1 KB 223) and that its fact finding process was \\\"tainted by extreme irrationality or illogicality\\\".\\n\\n21 This ground was said to arise because, as expressed in its conclusion quoted above, the Tribunal had formed a \\\"perception\\\" without logically reasoning to it. The decision was arbitrary without a logical course of reasoning.\\n\\n22 This argument is without foundation. Plainly in par 24 of its reasons the Tribunal was using \\\"perception\\\" in the sense of a conclusion or finding, not some idiosyncratic or capricious impression. It was entirely open to the Tribunal to conclude on the evidence, and particularly that relating to the offence itself, that the applicant was a man who was, in the language of the Tribunal, \\\"self-absorbed, emotive and vengeful\\\". There was every reason to think that if released and at large in Australia he might continue to pursue Mrs Flowers. This was a case where even if the risk of re-offending could be assessed as slight, the possible outcome if the risk eventuated would be catastrophic, involving the death of or serious injury to a particular person.\",\"4\":\"24 This was not a relevant consideration in the Peko-Wallsend sense, that is to say it was not a consideration the Tribunal was bound to take into account, having regard to the text of the Migration Act or by implication from its subject-matter, scope and purpose: Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Limited [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 39-41. At best it was evidence. Even if it had been ignored there would have been no legal error by the Tribunal, still less jurisdictional error.\\n\\n25 But in any event there is no reason to conclude that the Tribunal did not pay regard to Dr Sale's report. Moreover, the character and medical problems detailed by Dr Sale are by no means confined to the lymphoma question. It is a considerable distortion to impute to Dr Sale the view that (i) all the applicant's criminal behaviour was due to his fear of lymphoma, (ii) it is now established he does not have lymphoma, (iii) ergo there is now no risk of further criminal behaviour, and in particular, towards his wife.\\n\\n26 The appeal will be dismissed with costs. \\n\\n\\n I certify that the preceding twenty-six (26) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Heerey . \\n\\n\\nAssociate:\\n\\nDated: \\n\\n\\n Counsel for the Applicant: S P Estcourt QC and G J Barns \\n \\n Solicitor for the Applicant: Don Armstrong \\n \\n Counsel for the Respondent: G Livermore \\n \\n Solicitor for the Respondent: Australian Government Solicitor \\n \\n Date of Hearing: 15 March 2006 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 28 March 2006 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2006\\/307.html\"}}"
