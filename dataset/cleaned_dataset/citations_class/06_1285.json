This is not an easy question to answer. The proper approach in arriving at the answer must be based on the principle that the relevant provisions should be construed broadly: Australian Softwood Forests Pty Ltd v Attorney-General (NSW) [1981] HCA 49 ; (1981) 148 CLR 121. Adopting a broad view, it can be said that the investors (the clients) have contributed their homes for them to be used to generate benefits for themselves. The first benefit was the periodic tax free payments extending over many years. The homes were to generate this benefit as they were to be on-sold to investors who would provide the necessary funds. Also, there were benefits, or potential benefits, arising out of the leases. It will be remembered that each lease was for the client's life at what appears to be less than the market rent. This gave rise to two benefits; one actual the other potential. First, there was the low rent which was an immediate benefit. Second, there was the potential benefit that would arise if the client were to live longer than expected according to the life tables. Previously I noted that the consideration for the life tenancy (the amount deducted from the purchase price for the property) was based on life tables. If the client outlived the age prescribed in those tables he would receive a benefit; effectively the right to occupy the home for the additional period at no cost.\\n\\nAssuming these to be relevant benefits for the purpose of the definition of \\\"financial investment\\\" it is still necessary to decide whether the word \\\"gives\\\" in the phrase \\\"gives money or money's worth\\\" includes a sale with a lease-back. Ordinarily the word \\\"gives\\\" would not carry that meaning. I observe, however, that in the note to s 12BAA there are examples of what acts constitute making a financial investment. One example is the subscription of money for shares in a company. In substance this is the acquisition of an asset for its exchange value in the hope of making either a capital profit or receiving income. If \\\"gives\\\" includes the purchase of an asset there is no reason why it should not also include a sale.\\n\\nTo this point I have not dealt with whether the statements about the client having a \\\"guaranteed tenancy\\\" or a \\\"guaranteed lifetime tenancy\\\" are misleading. In my view they are not for the reason that the lifetime tenancy which had been granted to the client was in fact \\\"guaranteed\\\" in the only relevant sense, namely that it could not be defeated by MFL, MFLP or any person claiming through them.\",\"1\":\"I base this conclusion on s 42(2)(e) of the Transfer of Land Act 1958 (Vic) and the equivalent provision in the Torrens legislation in other States. The effect of s 42(2)(e) is that the estate of a registered proprietor of land (including the proprietor of a mortgage) is subject to the rights of a tenant in possession. In this area the relevant principles are clearly established. The first is that the possession of a tenant is notice of any right of the tenant affecting the land: McMahon v Swan [1924] VLR 397, 406. The second is that, as Dixon J confirmed in Burke v Dawes [1938] HCA 6 ; (1938) 59 CLR 1, 17-18, s 72 of the Transfer of Land Act 1928 (Vic) (which is the forerunner of s 42) was not intended to apply merely to a tenancy as commonly understood. See also Downie v Lockwood [1965] VR 257, 259 where Smith J said \\\"As appears from the cases the exception in s. 42 (2) (e) is to be widely construed; and it is to be treated as producing the result that \\\"any person in actual occupation of the land obtains as against any inconsistent registered dealing protection and priority for any equitable interest to which his occupation is incident, provided that at law his occupation is referable to a tenancy of sort, whether at will or for years\\\". Thus, for the purposes of the section a purchaser under a contract, who is given possession by the vendor and is only a tenant at will, is protected in respect of his equitable ownership: Robertson v Keith (1870) 1 VLR(E) 11. So, too, is a vendor who remains in possession until the purchase price is paid: he is a tenant \\\"whatever might be the legal denomination of the tenancy\\\": The Commercial Bank of Australia Limited v McCaskill (1897) 23 VLR 10, 12. It has also been held that an equitable life estate will prevail over a subsequent registered interest: Black v Poole (1895) 16 ALT 155.\",\"2\":\"I base this conclusion on s 42(2)(e) of the Transfer of Land Act 1958 (Vic) and the equivalent provision in the Torrens legislation in other States.

By promising to make the payments, the purchaser company was implicitly stating that it had the capacity to meet that obligation: Futuretronics International Pty Ltd v Gadzhis [1992] 2 VR 217. In truth the company had no such capacity.\\n\\nThese conclusions do not, however, establish contraventions of the relevant sections. Those sections proscribe misleading and deceptive conduct \\\"in relation to financial services\\\" (s 12DA), or in connection with the supply or possible supply of \\\"financial services\\\" (s 12DB), or in connection with the sale or grant or the possible sale or grant of a \\\"financial product\\\" that involves an interest in land (s 12DC), or in relation to a \\\"financial product\\\" or a \\\"financial service\\\" (s 1041H). It is therefore necessary to consider whether the conduct which I have found to be misleading concerned a \\\"financial service\\\" or a \\\"financial product\\\".\\n\\nAs we shall see the two concepts, both of which are defined in the statutes, are interrelated. The relevant provisions in the Corporations Act and the ASIC Act are almost the same. For convenience I will refer to the ASIC Act. Section 12BAB(1) of the ASIC Act provides that a person provides a \\\"financial service\\\" if they, among other things, provide \\\"financial product advice\\\" or deal in a \\\"financial product\\\". Section 12BAB(5) defines \\\"financial product advice\\\" to mean a recommendation or statement of opinion or report that is intended to influence a person in making a decision in relation to a particular \\\"financial product\\\" or class of \\\"financial products\\\".\",\"4\":\"I base this conclusion on s 42(2)(e) of the Transfer of Land Act 1958 (Vic) and the equivalent provision in the Torrens legislation in other States.
