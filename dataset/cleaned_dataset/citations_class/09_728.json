Relevantly, in relation to the five categories, the Court observed at [48]: \\n Under the rubric of unconscionable conduct, equity will: \\n\\n \\n (i) Set aside a contract or disposition resulting from the knowing exploitation by one party of the special disadvantage of another. The special disadvantage may be constitutional, deriving from age, illness, poverty, inexperience or lack of education Commercial Bank of Australia Ltd v Amadio [(1983) [1983] HCA 14 ; 151 CLR 447]. Or it may be situational, deriving from particular features of a relationship between actors in the transaction such as the emotional dependence of one on the other Louth v Diprose [(1992) 175 CLR 62]; Bridgewater v Leahy [1998] HCA 66 ; (1998) 194 CLR 457. \\n (ii) Set aside as against third parties a transaction entered into as the result of the defective comprehension by a party to the transaction, the influence of another and the want of any independent explanation to the complaining party Garcia v National Australia Bank Ltd [1998] HCA 48 ; (1988) 194 CLR 395. \\n (iii) Prevent a party from exercising a legal right in a way that involves unconscionable departure from a representation relied upon by another to his or her detriment Waltons Stores (Interstate) Ltd v Maher [(1988) [1988] HCA 7 ; 164 CLR 387] ; Commonwealth v Verwayen [(1990) [1990] HCA 39 ; 170 CLR 394]. \\n (iv) Relieve against forfeiture and penalty Legione v Hateley [(1983) [1983] HCA 11 ; 152 CLR 406] ; Stern v McArthur [(1988) [1988] HCA 51 ; 165 CLR 489]. \\n (v) Rescind contracts entered into under the influence of unilateral mistake Taylor v Johnson [(1983) [1983] HCA 5 ; 151 CLR 422]. \\n\\n \\n Each of these categories of case (the list may not be exhaustive) involves the identification of unconscionable conduct, albeit its content and degree will vary according to the category. It is a term which has various shades of meaning according to its context. There are different thresholds of conduct in various categories, all of which may be described as unconscionable G Dal Pont, \\\"The Varying Shades of 'Unconscionable' Conduct Same Term, Different Meaning\\\" (2000) 19 Aust Bar Rev 135 at p 165.\\n\\nI am of the view that the Access Agreement did not result from the knowing exploitation by Telstra of any special disadvantage of Optus whether constitutional or situational: the first category referred to in Samton Holdings ([48]). I am also of the view that this is not a case where equity needs to intervene to prevent Telstra from exercising a legal right in a way that involves unconscionable departure from a representation relied upon by Optus to its detriment: the third category referred to in Samton Holdings ([48]). The other categories there referred to are irrelevant.\\n\\nWhile the Full Court itself acknowledged the list may not be exhaustive, the fact that the terms of the Access Agreement were ultimately concluded in the way they were such that the conduct of Telstra which is impugned in this case was found to be a breach of contract would suggest that Optus was not only aware, which it undoubtedly was, that Telstra would have access to Optus' traffic information but that its disadvantage in this respect it did not have access to Telstra's traffic information was nevertheless counter-balanced by the restrictions on the use and disclosure of such information. The fact that Telstra acted in contravention of those restrictions does not make its conduct unconscionable.\\n\\nIt follows that I also decline to find that Telstra engaged in unconscionable conduct in contravention of s 51AA of the TPA.\\n\\nI will direct the parties to bring in short minutes of order to give effect to these reasons and the reasons published on 30 April 2009, as well as to move the proceeding to its next phase.\\n I certify that the preceding sixteen (16) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Edmonds. \\n \\n Associate:\\n \\n \\nDated: 10 July 2009\\n \\n Counsel for the Applicant: Mr RM Smith SC and MR C Dimitriadis \\n \\n Solicitor for the Applicant: Baker & McKenzie \\n \\n Counsel for the Respondent: Mr CRC Newlinds SC and Mr IR Pike \\n \\n Solicitor for the Respondent: Mallesons Stephen Jaques \\n Date of Hearing: 7, 8 and 10 October 2008 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 10 July 2009 \\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2009\\/728.html\",\"1\":\"As the learned authors of Meagher, Gummow and Lehane's Equity, Doctrine and Remedies , 4 th ed., observe at 41-025 it may be accepted that, since Moorgate Tobacco Co Ltd v Philip Morris Ltd (No. 2) [1984] HCA 73 ; (1984) 156 CLR 414 , there exists a general equitable jurisdiction to grant relief against actual or threatened abuse of confidential information not involving any tort or breach of contract (at 438 per Deane J in delivering the judgment of the High Court). But where there exists a contract, the position is not as clear. The learned authors had earlier said (at 41-020): \\n Where there is a contract then it is to the contract that the court should look to see from express words or necessary implication what the obligations of the parties are and the introduction of equitable concepts should be resisted. \\n\\n \\nOn the other hand, as the learned authors go on to acknowledge, there have been a number of cases involving a contractual nexus where judges have nevertheless treated equitable principles at length as if they overlapped or were concurrent with the common law.\\n\\nNevertheless, where, as here, there is not only a contract between the parties, but a contract which, in its terms, defines 'Confidential Information' on an exhaustive basis (cl 1.1 of the Access Agreement) and regulates the obligations of each party in relation to the Confidential Information of the other party on a comprehensive basis (cl 15 of the Access Agreement), there is, in my view, no reason for the intervention of equity for the simple reason that there is no need for its intervention to achieve justice between the parties for conduct which is common to both the finding of breach of contract and the ground relied on for equitable intervention.\\n\\nMoreover, the conclusion expressed in [4] above is reinforced where, as here, the contract contains a provision such as cl 16.1 which provides: \\n Save to the extent that another provision of this agreement expressly provides for (or expressly excludes or limits) a remedy, a liability or a form of compensation in relation to an act, omission or event, this clause 16 shall regulate the liability (whether arising in contract, in tort, under statute or in any other way and whether due to negligence, wilful or deliberate breach or any other cause) of a party to each other party under and in relation to this agreement and in relation to any act, omission or event relating to or arising out of this agreement.\"}}"
