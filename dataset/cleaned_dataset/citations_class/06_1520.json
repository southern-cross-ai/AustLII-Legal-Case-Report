The Tribunal member said that, in the appellant's circumstances, the consequence of the compensation legislation was as intended, that is to say, that neither the appellant nor Mrs Ilba should retain compensation and compensation effected Centrelink payments. He noted that the appellant argued that in some way Centrelink had foregone its right to retain the recovered moneys through what he considered to be Centrelink's harassment of himself. The Tribunal member said that on the evidence before him he was unable to conclude that the appellant had been harassed by Centrelink, but he said that in any event, he considered that any such harassment was unrelated to Centrelink's decisions in 1989, that is at least 14 years prior to the date the appellant suggested his harassment by Centrelink commenced. For these reasons, the Tribunal decided that the decision under review should be affirmed.\",\"1\":\"9 The Tribunal member referred to two authorities which had considered the nature of this discretion.

The operation of the recovery provisions did not produce anything unfair, unintended or unjust in the relevant sense (see Groth v Secretary, Department of Social Security (supra) at 545). In fact, I did not understand the appellant to put his case in this way. His complaint was that some time after the respondent's predecessor had decided to recover the relevant amount, he had been harassed by the respondent's predecessor and that this harassment was a sufficient basis for an order that the amount recovered be repaid to him. The acts constituting the alleged harassment were not identified by the appellant. Even if they had been, harassment some time after the recovery of the money by the respondent could not constitute special circumstances within the provisions of s 156 of the Social Security Act 1947 (Cth) or s 1184K of the Social Security Act 1991 (Cth). In my opinion, the appeal is clearly unarguable and it is an appropriate case for me to exercise the power in O 20 r 2 of the Federal Court Rules .\\n\\n14 The appeal is dismissed.\\n\\n I certify that the preceding fourteen (14) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice BESANKO. \\n\\n\\n Associate:\\n\\nDated: 15 November 2006\\n\\n\\n The Applicant: The applicant appeared in person. \\n \\n Counsel for the Respondent: J Abbott \\n \\n Solicitor for the Respondent: Sparke Helmore \\n \\n Date of Hearing: 23 October 2006 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 15 November 2006 \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2006\\/1520.html\"}}"
