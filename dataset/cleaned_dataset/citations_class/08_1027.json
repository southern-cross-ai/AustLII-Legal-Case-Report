Primus says that in New South Wales it relied on the release provisions to defeat an argument by Kooee that Primus had been negligent in the provision of information required under the Separation Deed. Primus says that, in this Court, it wishes to allege that the release provisions are ineffectual to protect Kooee from allegations that it misled and deceived Primus, and made misrepresentations which led to Primus entering into the Separation Deed. It relies on the principle referred to in Henjo Investments Pty Ltd v Collins Marrickville Pty Ltd (No 1) (New York Deli case) [1988] FCA 40 ; (1988) 39 FCR 546 at 560-561 to the effect that exclusion clauses can't operate to defeat claims made under s 52 of the Trade Practices Act . Primus contends that a ruling to that effect would not lead to a judgment inconsistent with that in New South Wales which concerned an examination of entitlements under the Separation Deed itself and not any claims based on a statutory remedy or allied contractual claims.\\n\\n22 The application and statement of claim in the current proceeding came to Kooee's attention in January 2008. In a letter to Primus' solicitors dated 30 January 2008, the solicitors for Kooee said that the Federal Court proceeding came as a surprise to Kooee as it arose out of the same series of transactions that were the subject of the New South Wales case. The letter asked for the reasons why the subject matter of the \\\"Victorian proceeding\\\" was not raised in the \\\"NSW proceedings\\\". In a reply letter, dated 15 February 2008, the solicitors for Primus took issue with the suggestion that the current proceeding arose out of the same series of transactions as in the New South Wales litigation. After identifying the different nature of the two sets of proceedings, the letter said:\\n The quantification of loss in the current proceedings will have regard to the amount of the debt recovered (and not recovered) in the NSW proceedings, but there is no question of double recovery.\\n\\n23 The letter also stated, no doubt on instructions, that:\\n Our client [Primus] was unaware of the potential availability of the causes of action which found the present proceedings at the time the NSW proceedings were instituted. Having sought and received legal advice as to its rights, our client determined to initiate the current proceedings promptly.\",\"5\":\"5 The invocation of the Anshun principle is a serious step and a power which should not be exercised without a scrupulous examination of all the circumstances.

However, the fact that the New South Wales litigation and this proceeding are closely related is insufficient to invoke the Anshun principle. The question remains whether it was unreasonable for Primus to defer reliance on its current claims.\\n\\n26 Based in large part on the inadequacy of the response of Primus' solicitor when asked why he did not raise the current issues earlier, the subject matter of the current claims could have been raised in the New South Wales Supreme Court at first instance. This may have been done by way of an amendment to that proceeding; with the original New South Wales claims raised in addition or in the alternative.\\n\\n30 The alleged unreasonableness is not manifest. No doubt it would have been more convenient for the issues raised in the current proceeding to have been advanced in New South Wales, but that is not the question. It is not appropriate when considering the Anshun principle to say what a party could reasonably have done. The proper question is, was it unreasonable to do as that party did?

It would still be open to Kooee to advance its submissions based on the Anshun principle at the trial of the proceeding when the issues will be more clearly defined.\\n\\n31 This is not a clear case for the invocation of the Anshun principle. The critical facts will differ substantially from the essential facts which were relevant in New South Wales, where the Separation Deed was the main focus of the Court's analysis as distinct from the conduct of Kooee over a confined period. There is no risk of inconsistent judgments or orders. It was not unreasonable for Primus to refrain from advancing its current claims before the Supreme Court of New South Wales.\",\"7\":\"28 There is a further consideration in support of the view that Primus did not act unreasonably in not raising the issues in the current application in the New South Wales Supreme Court proceeding. That reason would defeat the current motion even if the view that the facts are not substantially the same is in error. The reason is that no judgment or order can be made in the current proceeding which will conflict with any judgment or order made in New South Wales. The judgments in New South Wales give effect to the Separation Deed by interpreting the rights of the parties under it. Any judgment in this proceeding will focus on the conduct of Kooee in the six month or so period leading up to the termination of the VSPA to examine whether Kooee engaged in conduct of the kind which caused compensable damage to Primus. As Einstein J said at [10] in Primus Telecommunications Pty Ltd v Kooee Communications Limited [2007] NSWSC 91: \\n The VSPA received only minimal attention during the hearing. It is likely sufficient for present purposes to do no more than to set out the recitals and some detail from the schedules.\\n\\n29 An examination of the entirety of those reasons gives no cause for concern of any likely embarrassment in the sense that this Court will be required to consider taking a contrary view on any issue to that taken by Einstein J or the Court of Appeal. On this ground alone the motion must be dismissed. It is not unreasonable to defer the bringing of a claim which could have been brought in an earlier proceeding if there is no likelihood of inconsistent orders or judgments. In this context the submissions of Primus on the deed of release issue referred to at [21] above are persuasive.\",\"8\":\"12 A finding of relevant unreasonableness is not to be made lightly. It is a severe test different from a test of severe inconvenience. The starting point should be free access to the courts: R & J Lyons Family Settlement Pty Ltd v 155 Macquarie Street Pty Ltd [2008] NSWSC 232 per Bryson JA.\\n\\n13 Primus, from 2000 until 2005, supplied telecommunications carriage services to Kooee for re-sale to customers of Kooee. Primus carried out functions in Kooee's name such as billing, revenue collection, call centre support and customer relations. A written agreement known as the Virtual Service Provider Agreement or the VSPA regulated the commercial relationship between Primus and Kooee. Amongst other things, the VSPA provided for the distribution of revenue collected by Primus between Primus and Kooee resulting from the re-sale of telecommunications services to Kooee's customers. The parties entered into the VSPA in July 2000. A \\\"letter agreement\\\" dated 14 April 2003 extended the operations of the VSPA until 1 August 2006.\\n\\n14 During the operation of the VSPA, Primus and Kooee had a difference of opinion about the operation of the provisions of the VSPA which dealt with the distribution of income between Primus and Kooee and, in particular, the amounts owing to Kooee by Primus out of the revenue collected by Primus.\",\"9\":\"32 Kooee also submitted that the current proceeding is an abuse of process. It based that submission on the judgment of the High Court in Walton v Gardiner [1993] HCA 77 ; (1993) 177 CLR 378 where at 392-393 Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ held that it would be an abuse of process to allow a party to litigate afresh a matter which has already been disposed of in earlier proceeding. That is because it would be manifestly unfair to do so. No such abuse of process arises here. The matter sought to be now litigated is entirely different in character to that disposed of in the earlier proceeding. The earlier litigation resolved a dispute about the meaning of the Separation Deed. This proceeding concerns a dispute about the circumstances which led to its making.\\n\\n33 The Court will order as follows:\\n \\n1. The respondent's motion of 3 March 2008 is dismissed.\\n \\n2.
