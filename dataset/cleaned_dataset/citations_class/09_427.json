His Honour said that that is the maximum which should ordinarily be allowed.\\n\\nSection 439B(2) now states that the period of the adjournment, or the total periods of adjournment, must not exceed 45 business days. Here, the section 439A meeting was convened on 20 February 2009 and there have been further adjournments as mentioned above.\",\"1\":\"In Re LOCM Pty Ltd (Administrators Appointed) (1997) 79 FCR 35 , Goldberg J came to the view that the court has power under section 447A to make an order extending the time fixed by section 439B(2). His Honour was of the view that the effect of the authorities was that it was not appropriate to extend the period for more than the 60 days which was then the maximum provided under section 439B(2). Goldberg J considered in some detail the authorities which have dealt with the power under section 447A.\\n\\nThe adjournment which is now sought is 40 business days from 20 April 2009. It may be argued that this period is a significant extension of the period of 45 business days from the date of the meeting prescribed by s 439B(2) , but even if that is so, it is my view that the authorities to which Goldberg J referred in Re LOCM are wide enough to permit the order which is sought. His Honour observed that the power under section 447A is not limited to the operation of filling in gaps in the legislative scheme but that its operation enables the alteration of the operation of a provision in Part 5.3A in relation to a particular company, in particular circumstances.\",\"2\":\"It is true, of course, as the authorities have established, that the legislative intention is that administrations under Part 5.3A are to proceed expeditiously and that the spirit of Part 5.3A is to prevent administrations from being unduly extended. Nevertheless, that needs to be balanced against the policy expressed in a number of the leading authorities that the court ought also to bear in mind the interest of the creditors in obtaining the possibility of a greater dividend than that which would follow from a making of a winding-up order; see for example Mann v Abruzzi Sports Club Ltd (1994) 12 ACSR 611 at 613.\\n\\nHere, the creditors have requested the administrator to grant an extension up to 1 June but for reasons mentioned above, the administrator has taken the view that a slightly longer period may be required. In the particular circumstances of this case, it seems to me to be appropriate to exercise the power conferred under 447A to make the order which is sought.\\n\\nI will therefore make orders in accordance with the draft orders provided to me. I will sign and date the orders, in accordance with the draft dated 27 April 2009 and that will be placed with the court papers. \\n I certify that the preceding eighteen (18) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Jacobson. \\n \\n Associate:\\n \\n \\nDated: 30 April 2009\\n \\n Solicitor for the Plaintiff: Shaw Reynolds Bowen & Gerathy \\n Date of Hearing: 27 April 2009 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 27 April 2009 \\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2009\\/427.html\"}}"
