That view is consistent with the approach to the notion of \\\"reasonable grounds\\\" in George v Rockett (1990) 93 ALR 483 and Rema Industries and Services Pty Ltd v Coad & Ors (1992) 107 ALR 374. In determining whether reasonable grounds for a belief exist, there is a relationship between the objective facts that must engender such a belief and the role, standards and duties of the person confronting the relevant facts. In this case, the officials are permit holders under the Act and Mr Dettmer is an experienced State Secretary of the AMWU. In the face of an employer's objection to entry in the manner of 19 November 2008 and correspondence from the employer pressing that objection, a permit holder and the Unions as organisations, must necessarily give consideration to the merits of the employer's claims and form a view as to whether the claims are well placed or not. If the Unions and the permit holders are satisfied that the claims are misplaced , the demonstrated consideration of the claims is very likely to suggest that the relevant person when seeking to enter the site had reasonable grounds for believing that entry was authorised even though events may subsequently demonstrate that entry was not authorised. Persons in the position of permit holders or officers of Unions cannot be said to have acted reasonably in the absence of reasonable investigation and enquiry into objections made and strongly pressed denying the very right of entry relied upon by those seeking entry. That follows because statutory rights of entry to premises carry with the exercise of those rights corresponding duties of enquiry to be reasonably satisfied that entry is authorised in the context of the facts and circumstances before the entry seeker. That corresponding duty is not only a function of a balance between rights and obligations but derives from Part 15 of the Act, the objects recited in s 736 of the Act and the regime established for granting permits to enter.\",\"11\":\"Whether a person has reasonable grounds to believe that entry is not authorised involves an objective assessment of whether facts were before that person sufficient to induce a reasonable person to believe that grounds existed for denying authority to enter.
