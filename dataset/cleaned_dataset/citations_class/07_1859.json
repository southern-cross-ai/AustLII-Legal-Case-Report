As Merkel J said in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Humax Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 706 (\\\" Humax \\\") at [5], engaging in resale price maintenance is a serious offence. This is apparent from the magnitude of the pecuniary penalties that corporations, and those through whom they act, may face for contravention of s 48 of the Act .\\n\\n11 The consent orders proposed by the parties include:\\n \\n \\n (a) declarations under s 21 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) that the particular conduct in which each of the respondents engaged constituted a contravention of the Act ;\\n (b) injunctions restraining each of the respondents from engaging in proscribed conduct for a period of three years from the date of the order;\\n (c) orders requiring TEAC to establish an education and compliance programme for its employees; \\n (d) an order that TEAC pay a pecuniary penalty of $175,000 in four instalments; and \\n (e) an order that Mr Allison pay a pecuniary penalty of $15,000 in four instalments. \\n \\n\\nThere is to be a further order, providing for what is to happen in the event of default in the payment of any instalment of penalty.\\n\\n14 The proposed probation order in this case is very like the probation orders made by Merkel J in Humax and by Tracey J in Digital Products.

The constellation of circumstances, essential character of the conduct and the factors to be weighed by the Court are inevitably sufficiently different in each case that previous determinations ultimately provide little utility in precisely informing the appropriate pecuniary penalty to be imposed in any particular contravention. \\n \\n However, an assessment of previous determinations in relation to resale price maintenance conduct may provide a high level broad range within which an appropriate pecuniary penalty may be imposed having regard to the character and content of the contravention and other considerations reflecting some elements broadly consistent with the evidence in the particular case. \\n\\n\\nAfter making these observations, the Court undertook an analysis of several cases with sufficiently similar facts to provide a high level broad range of comparison.
