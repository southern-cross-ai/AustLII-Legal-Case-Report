In that case their Honours stipulated that, in order for information to fall within s 424A(3)(a) and therefore be excluded from the application of s 424A(1) , it must be information not specifically about the applicant or another person. The further reference to information that is \\\"just about a class of persons of which the applicant or other person is a member\\\" is not a second criterion to be met, but is designed to underline the specificity required by precluding any argument that reference to a class could be taken as reference to all individuals (including, for example, an applicant) falling in it ( NAMW 140 FCR at 599-600). The reasoning in NAMW [2004] FCAFC 264 ; 140 FCR 572 was also adopted by the Full Court in WAJW v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 330.\\n\\n35 Accordingly, examples of information excluded by section 424A (3)(a) are:\\n \\n\\u2022 country information: NAMW [2004] FCAFC 264 ; 140 FCR 572, SZBJQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1346 and SZGQZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1091 \\n \\n\\u2022 information from a university website as to the content of a marketing degree course SZFLL v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 355 \\n \\n\\u2022 information from Canadian source material, telephone interviews, DFAT and UK Home Office material that it would be difficult to leave the relevant country if one was wanted by the authorities: WAJW [2004] FCAFC 330.\\n\\n37 I do not accept the submission of Mr Young that the relevant information upon which the Tribunal was relying in its decision of 8 February 2007 pertained only to whether people could fly directly from Australia to India if they were in possession of a valid Nepalese passport. From the material I have set out above it is clear that there exists information in the public domain concerning the lack of restriction on persons holding Nepalese passports to enter India, and although not identified as such as it was in the decision of the Tribunal as first constituted, it was upon this information that the Tribunal was clearly relying in both its letter to the appellant and its decision of 8 February 2007. This was information not specifically about the appellant or another person. It concerned a class of persons, of which the appellant was a member, namely all Nepalese citizens with passports. Although not specifically identified as such, it was information akin to country information.

(2001) 113 FCR 396 at 428)\\n \\n\\u2022 a determination of the Tribunal that the information provided by the applicant in the original application lacks specificity and detail: VAAM v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCAFC 120 \\n \\n\\u2022 a view taken by the Tribunal as to the unsatisfactory nature of answers provided by an applicant: NADH of 2001 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 328.\\n\\n31 The statements of the Tribunal in this case with respect to the ability of the appellant to leave Nepal and go to another country such as India without a visa appear to refer to \\\"information\\\" upon which the Tribunal was relying, rather than constituting \\\"subjective appraisals, thought processes or determinations.\\\" The Tribunal was relying on what it understood to be a fact - namely that it was legally possible for the appellant to have left Nepal once she obtained her passport, and, irrespective of having a visa, gone immediately to another country such as India. In my view this was clearly \\\"knowledge of relevant facts or circumstances\\\" as explained by the Full Court in VAF 206 ALR 471, not a view taken by the Tribunal based on facts. The conclusion which was reached by the Tribunal, based on what it understood to be the fact that the appellant was entitled to leave Nepal and, without needing a visa, go to India, was that because the appellant had not done so she did not have a well-founded fear of serious harm from the Maoists or from any other source.\\n\\n32 Accordingly, the Tribunal was relying on \\\"information\\\" for the purposes of s 424A(1). \\n Did the information upon which the Tribunal relied fall within the exception in section 424A(3)(a)?\\n\\n33 The first respondent submitted that, if the findings of the Tribunal were based on \\\"information\\\", it was information falling within s 424A(3)(b) in that it was information not specifically about the applicant or another person, but was about a class of persons of which the applicant or other person was a member.\",\"14\":\"30 It is not in dispute that \\\"information\\\" for the purposes of s 424A(1) does not include \\\"subjective appraisals, thought processes or determinations\\\" of the Tribunal: SZBYR 235 ALR 609. \\\"Subjective appraisals, thought processes or determinations\\\" include for example:\\n \\n\\u2022 the Tribunal's disbelief of an applicant's evidence arising from inconsistencies in the applicant's evidence ( SZBYR 235 ALR at 616, Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Applicant A125 of 2003 [2007] FCAFC 162 , VAF 206 ALR at 476, WAGP of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 266 ; (2002) 124 FCR 276)\\n \\n\\u2022 a determination by the Tribunal that the applicant's account is or may not be credible ( Tin v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1109 , Paul v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1196 ; (2001) 113 FCR 396 at 428)\\n \\n\\u2022 a determination of the Tribunal that the information provided by the applicant in the original application lacks specificity and detail: VAAM v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCAFC 120 \\n \\n\\u2022 a view taken by the Tribunal as to the unsatisfactory nature of answers provided by an applicant: NADH of 2001 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 328.\",\"15\":\"34 The background to the enactment of s 424A(3)(b) was considered at length by Merkel and Hely JJ in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v NAMW [2004] FCAFC 264 ; (2004) 140 FCR 572. In that case their Honours stipulated that, in order for information to fall within s 424A(3)(a) and therefore be excluded from the application of s 424A(1) , it must be information not specifically about the applicant or another person. The further reference to information that is \\\"just about a class of persons of which the applicant or other person is a member\\\" is not a second criterion to be met, but is designed to underline the specificity required by precluding any argument that reference to a class could be taken as reference to all individuals (including, for example, an applicant) falling in it ( NAMW 140 FCR at 599-600). The reasoning in NAMW [2004] FCAFC 264 ; 140 FCR 572 was also adopted by the Full Court in WAJW v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 330.\\n\\n35 Accordingly, examples of information excluded by section 424A (3)(a) are:\\n \\n\\u2022 country information: NAMW [2004] FCAFC 264 ; 140 FCR 572, SZBJQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1346 and SZGQZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1091 \\n \\n\\u2022 information from a university website as to the content of a marketing degree course SZFLL v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 355 \\n \\n\\u2022 information from Canadian source material, telephone interviews, DFAT and UK Home Office material that it would be difficult to leave the relevant country if one was wanted by the authorities: WAJW [2004] FCAFC 330.\\n\\n37 I do not accept the submission of Mr Young that the relevant information upon which the Tribunal was relying in its decision of 8 February 2007 pertained only to whether people could fly directly from Australia to India if they were in possession of a valid Nepalese passport. From the material I have set out above it is clear that there exists information in the public domain concerning the lack of restriction on persons holding Nepalese passports to enter India, and although not identified as such as it was in the decision of the Tribunal as first constituted, it was upon this information that the Tribunal was clearly relying in both its letter to the appellant and its decision of 8 February 2007. This was information not specifically about the appellant or another person. It concerned a class of persons, of which the appellant was a member, namely all Nepalese citizens with passports. Although not specifically identified as such, it was information akin to country information. It is at least analogous to the information the subject of the decision in WAJW [2004] FCAFC 264 ; 140 FCR 572.\"}}"
