Neither of the limbs in Decor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc (1991) 104 ALR 621 has been made out in the present case.\\n\\nIn summary, there is not sufficient doubt about the Federal Magistrate's decision to warrant it being reconsidered by the Federal Court. The applicant, apart from evincing her unhappiness that the Federal Magistrate's decision was adverse to her, has not identified any error in that decision. It is plain also that no substantial injustice will result from the refusal of leave.\\n\\nIn those circumstances the application for leave should be dismissed with costs to be taxed, if not agreed. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n I certify that the preceding twelve (12) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Spender. \\n\\n\\n Associate:\\n\\nDated: 11 August 2006\\n\\n\\n\\n The Appellant appeared in person \\n \\n \\n Solicitor for the Respondent: Ms Therese Quinn, Phillips Fox \\n \\n Date of Hearing: 7 August 2006 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 7 August 2006 \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2006\\/1044.html\"}}"
