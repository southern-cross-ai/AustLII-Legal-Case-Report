The \\\" reason \\\" for the Tribunal's decision was simply the inadequacy of any of the materials provided by the now Appellant. The Tribunal thus concluded: \\n \\n The mere fact that a person claims a fear of persecution for a particular reason does not establish the genuineness of the asserted fear or that it is \\\"well founded\\\" or is for the reason claimed. It remains for the first named applicant to satisfy the Tribunal that all of the statutory elements are made out. Although the concept of onus of proof is not appropriate to administrative inquiries and decision-making the relevant facts of the individual case will have to be supplied by the applicants themselves in as much detail as is necessary to enable the decision maker to establish the relevant facts. The Tribunal is not required to make the applicants' case for them. Nor is the Tribunal required to accept uncritically any and all of the allegations made by applicants.

The Tribunal was unable to explore with the first named applicant who the \\\"antisocial elements' were that threatened him, when he was threatened, how he was threatened, whether he reported the threats to the police and, if so, what action the police took, who the people were he suspects attacked him, when he was attacked, how he was attacked, whether there were any witnesses present, whether he reported the attack to the police and, if so, what action the police took, whether he had considered relocation within India and what is likely to happen to him if he were to return to India in the foreseeable future.\\n The information that the first named applicant has submitted does not provide the necessary detail for the Tribunal to be satisfied as to the veracity of his claims or that he has a well founded fear of persecution.\\n Further the Tribunal has not been able to discuss with the first named applicant independent country information which may be relevant to his particular claims. In these circumstances the Tribunal is unable to be satisfied that the first named applicant has a well founded fear of persecution for reasons of his political opinion or any other Convention based reason.\",\"1\":\"9 First, the \\\" certain adverse information used by the Tribunal \\\" has not been identified. The proceedings before the Tribunal did not involve, as do many applications for review, an assessment of competing accounts of factual events. The Tribunal in the present proceedings had limited information available to it and, recognising that there was no onus of proof upon the now Appellants, simply concluded that:\\n \\n ...The information that the first named applicant has submitted does not provide the necessary detail for the Tribunal to be satisfied as to the veracity of his claims or that he has a well founded fear of persecution. \\n\\n Section 424A , it may be accepted, imposes a mandatory requirement: SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 at [77] per McHugh J, at [173] per Kirby J, at [208] per Hayne J, [2005] HCA 24 ; 228 CLR 294. But no breach can be established unless the particular \\\" information \\\" which it is claimed needs to be the subject of an invitation to comment upon or respond to can be first identified.\\n\\n10 The First Appellant appeared unrepresented before this Court this morning but did have the benefit of an interpreter. Other than expressing a desire to stay longer in Australia, he provided no assistance as to the \\\" certain adverse information \\\" to which his Notice of Appeal refers. Indeed, it was unclear whether the complaint was directed to the use of information already provided or whether the complaint was more directed to the lack of an opportunity to provide further information. If the latter, it is considered that adequate opportunity has already been extended in which to provide information.\\n\\n11 Second, the \\\" information \\\" considered by the Tribunal and the \\\" information \\\" which it ultimately considered did not make out the Applicant's case was that in fact supplied by the Applicant. Such \\\" information \\\" is not \\\" information that the Tribunal considers would be the reason, or part of the reason, for affirming the decision that is under review \\\" within the meaning of s 424A(1)(a).\",\"2\":\"12 The contents of such \\\" information \\\", as was observed in SZBYR v Minister for Immigration & Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 at [17] , [2007] FCA 26 ; 235 ALR 609 at 615 by Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ, \\\" if ... believed ... would, one might have thought, have been a relevant step towards rejecting, not affirming, the decision under review .\\\" Moreover, it was the inadequacy of the materials provided by the now Appellants that was the \\\" reason \\\" for the Tribunal's decision. Where it is the Tribunal's \\\" disbelief of the appellant's evidence arising from inconsistencies therein, it is difficult to see how such disbelief could be characterised as constituting 'information' within the meaning of para (a) of s 424A(1) \\\": SZBYR v Minister for Immigration & Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 at [18] , [2007] FCA 26 ; 235 ALR 609 at 616.\",\"3\":\"14 No question of any breach of s 424A , in such circumstances, arises for resolution: SZIDH v Minister for Immigration & Citizenship [2007] FCA 369.

Allsop J there concluded:\\n \\n [29] ...The reason for the decision was simply (and no more than) the evaluative conclusion founded on the perceived inadequacy of the information, in the sense of an absence of detail and extrinsic explanation which had been invited. It would be an inadequate and misleading statement to say that the information was the reason or part of the reason for the decision. It was the lack of the requested further assistance and explanation that was the reason. \\n\\nThe same comment may be made in the present appeal.\\n\\n16 The appeal should thus be dismissed.\\n\\n17 The orders of the Court are:\\n \\n1.
