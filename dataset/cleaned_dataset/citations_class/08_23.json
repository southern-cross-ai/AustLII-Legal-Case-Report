Thus the requisite connection or relationship between the outgoing and the earning of assessable income \\\"was not to be inferred but must be positively established\\\". However, in the present case SBAF certainly had an external role. It was a trading entity in its own right, albeit an unsuccessful one, and used the borrowed funds for working capital to pay the expenses of its business.\",\"3\":\"42 The relevant taxpayer is the applicant. The focus is upon it and the use to which it put the borrowed funds. The Court is not concerned with SBC's purpose in advancing funds: GP International Pipecoaters Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1990] HCA 25 ; (1990) 170 CLR 124 at 136-137.\\n\\n43 I conclude the answer to Issue 2 is: yes.\\n\\n44 Section 245 - 35 (1) provides that a debt is forgiven if the debtor's obligation to pay the debt \\\"is released or waived, or is otherwise extinguished\\\".\",\"4\":\"51 In my opinion, the words of s 245-35(1) cannot be read down so as to require some express forgiveness. Waiver, for example, may be by conduct; it is an intentional act done with knowledge whereby a person abandons a right by acting in a manner inconsistent with that right: Craine v Colonial Mutual Fire Insurance Co Ltd [1920] HCA 64 ; (1920) 28 CLR 305 at 326, Grundt v Great Boulder Gold Mines Ltd [1937] HCA 58 ; (1937) 59 CLR 641 at 658. The expression \\\"or otherwise extinguished\\\" is wide and would cover an agreement, enforceable in equity, not to set up the cause of action in debt: McDermott v Black [1940] HCA 4 ; (1940) 63 CLR 161. SBAF was of course a party to the sale of shares agreement. After settlement of the sale of shares agreement and SBC's receipt of the purchase price from Tasman Group there is no way in which SBC could have recovered the debts previously owing by SBAF.\",\"5\":\"51 In my opinion, the words of s 245-35(1) cannot be read down so as to require some express forgiveness.

This approach is consistent with the classic definition of solvency in Sandell v Porter [1966] HCA 28 ; (1966) 115 CLR 666 at 670.\\n\\n67 I would therefore not accept Mr Hodgkinson's going concern basis.\\n\\n68 Mr Hodgkinson argued that a creditor valuing a debt in its own hands on a going concern basis will apply any payment against its oldest debt first. Therefore, he said, on Mr Meredith's figures, totalling SBC advances outstanding prior to each new advance meant that the distribution would be insufficient to repay any further advance after 31 January 1997.\"}}"
