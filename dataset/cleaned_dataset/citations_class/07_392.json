This does not mean that a party before it can simply present the facts and leave it to the tribunal to search out, and find, any available basis which theoretically the Act provides for relief. This Court has rejected that approach to the tribunal's duties. The function of the Tribunal, as of the delegate, is to respond to the case that the applicant advances.' (Footnotes omitted)\",\"1\":\"43 In SCAL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 548 , von Doussa J said that the Tribunal was not obliged to consider claims that have not been made.\",\"2\":\"44 The Tribunal's duty in respect of claims of this kind was further considered by the Full Court of this Court in NABE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 263 ; (2004) 219 ALR 27 (' NABE '). In that case the Full Court at 44 approved a statement by Selway J in SGBB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2003) 199 ALR 364 where his Honour said that:\\n \\n ' 18 The question, ultimately, is whether the case put by the appellant before the Tribunal has sufficiently raised a relevant issue that the Tribunal should have dealt with.'\\n\\n45 The Full Court in NABE went on to say at 44:\\n \\n 'This does not mean that the Tribunal is only required to deal with claims expressly articulated by the applicant. It is not obliged to deal with claims which are not articulated and which do not clearly arise from the materials before it.'\\n\\n46 The appellants' case was based upon a claim of political persecution. Whilst the Tribunal found that a number of threats had been made by particular persons, some of whom were politicians, it found that the motivation for the persecution was a desire to protect 'their own business interests from competition'. There was evidence to support that finding.\\n\\n47 In any event, the Tribunal found that the threats did not amount to serious harm within the meaning of s 91R of the Act. In view of the fact that the Tribunal rejected the appellants' claim that the senior political figure visited his home and carried out the threats and the attack on his father-in-law, such a finding was open to the Tribunal.\",\"3\":\"50 The appellants have argued that the Tribunal did not 'alert them' or 'canvass fully' the appellants' claimed link between membership of the social group of businessmen and membership of the political entity. However, the Tribunal did not have the responsibility of advancing a case for the appellants: Abebe v The Commonwealth [1999] HCA 14 ; (1999) 197 CLR 510; Re Ruddock; ex parte Applicant S154\\/2002 (2003) 201 ALR 437.\",\"4\":\"50 The appellants have argued that the Tribunal did not 'alert them' or 'canvass fully' the appellants' claimed link between membership of the social group of businessmen and membership of the political entity.

The applicant's evidence in that case was contradicted by a witness who the applicant asked to be called in a letter written to the Tribunal. Bennett J contrasted that situation where evidence was 'called by the Tribunal as part of its inquisitorial function (cf SAAP)'.
