As Tracey J observed in Stuart-Mahoney at [40], the relevant considerations include:\\n\\nThe respondents' conduct consisted of a brief stop work meeting and a short-lived ban on crane work. Crane work at the Site was only affected for 90 minutes and during this time the Sergi employees continued to perform other work at the Site. The ban and stop work meeting did not significantly disrupt work at the Site and any loss or damage caused was minimal.\\n\\nGiven the brief period of time in which the ban and stop work meeting occurred, and the interrelationship between the two events, it is appropriate to regard the stop work meeting and subsequent ban as a single course of conduct giving rise to a single contravention; see s 36(3) of the Act.\",\"2\":\"There are three instances of similar previous conduct by the Union involving breaches of s 38 ; see Stuart-Mahoney, Temple v Powell [2008] FCA 714 ; (2008) 169 FCR 169 and Duffy v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 2) [2009] FCA 299.

In contrast to the circumstances in Stuart-Mahoney, Temple and Duffy (No 2) , the respondents' conduct on 6 October 2006 was of limited duration and impact and penalties at the lower end of the scale are appropriate.\",\"3\":\"In light of the parties' agreement as to the appropriate penalties to be imposed, the relevant question for this Court is whether the agreed penalty is \\\"appropriate in all the circumstances\\\"; see Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd [2004] FCAFC 72 per Branson, Sackville and Gyles JJ at [51]. The penalties are not inappropriate merely because I would have imposed different figures. Rather, the penalties agreed by the parties must be within the permissible range of penalties for such a contravention; see Mobil Oil at [51] and [54]. The Court must still consider the factors relevant to the contraventions by the respondents to determine the permissible range of penalties for the contraventions.\\n\\nAn agreed penalty must adequately give effect to general and specific deterrence; Mobil Oil at [69]. Despite the limited duration and impact of the ban and stop work meeting, the imposition of penalties is appropriate in order to provide general and specific deterrence. Although the respondents may have held legitimate health and safety concerns, other avenues were available to the respondents to address these concerns in a lawful manner; see Duffy (No 2) at [18]. In light of these factors, I am satisfied that the agreed penalties proposed by the parties are sufficient to provide both general and specific deterrence.\\n\\nIn view of considerations discussed, I consider that the appropriate range of penalty is in the lower to medium range for the contravention of the Union and that the penalty agreed by the parties is appropriate in all the circumstances. I do have some concerns about imposing a monetary penalty on the second respondent for performing his job in accordance with the approach to industrial relations taken by his employer, the first respondent, in circumstances where that respondent has had a monetary penalty imposed on it. The penalty on the second respondent is within the permissible range, albeit at the upper end of that range. That is especially so where no prior contravention is alleged against the second respondent. Absent the parties' agreement I would not have imposed a penalty in that amount on the second respondent but as the agreed penalty is within the permissible range, albeit barely, I will order accordingly.\\n\\nThe parties have agreed that each should bear his and its own costs of the proceeding.\\n I certify that the preceding twenty-three (23) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Marshall. \\n \\n Associate:\\n \\n \\nDated: 29 July 2009\\n \\n Counsel for the Applicant: Mr J Bourke \\n \\n Solicitor for the Applicant: DLA Phillips Fox \\n \\n Counsel for the Respondents: Mr C Dowling \\n \\n Solicitor for the Respondents: Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union \\n Date of Hearing: 15 July 2009 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 29 July 2009 \\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2009\\/787.html\"}}"
