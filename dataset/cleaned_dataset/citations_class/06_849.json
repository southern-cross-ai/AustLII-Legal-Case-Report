The appeal for which s 46(1) provides is a proceeding that comes before the Court for hearing and determination in the exercise of its original, rather than its appellate, jurisdiction: see Employers First v Tolhurst Capital Ltd [2005] FCA 616 ; (2005) 143 FCR 356 (' Employers First ') at 357-358 [1] per Branson J. The subject matter of an appeal brought pursuant to s 46(1) is the question or questions of law on which the appeal is brought: Employers First at 357-358 [1]; and see generally TNT Skypak International (Aust) Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 19 ATR 1067 at 1070 per Gummow J.\\n\\n39 Section 14(1) is directed to the nature of the trustee's decision, whereas s 14(6) is concerned with the nature of the complaint: see Employers First at 372-373 [74]. For the Tribunal to have jurisdiction, the decision complained of before the Tribunal must be one made 'in relation to a particular member' and the complaint must not 'relate to the management of a fund as a whole'. The Tribunal determined that it had jurisdiction on the basis that 'the Complaints relate to whether the [applicant] has acted appropriately in relation to these [respondents'] accounts, not to members' accounts generally'. The applicant contends that, by mistakenly asserting the existence of its jurisdiction, the Tribunal erred in law: Craig v South Australia [1995] HCA 58 ; (1995) 184 CLR 163 at 177.\\n\\n43 The applicant also submitted that the Complaints were excluded from the Tribunal's jurisdiction by s 14(6), as they were not relevantly distinguishable from a complaint concerning the investment policy being adopted by the trustee of a fund. It relied on the statement by Branson J in Employers First at 372-373 [74] that '[a] clear example of a complaint that relates to the management of a fund as a whole would be a complaint concerning the investment policy being adopted by the trustee of the fund'.\\n\\n44 For the reasons set out below, I am satisfied that the Tribunal had jurisdiction to make the Determinations.\\n\\n45 Most, if not all, of the applicant's arguments on jurisdiction depend on the actions it took, adversely to the respondents, being characterised as a single decision in respect of all members of Division C of the Fund to set an interest rate applicable to members' account balances. The applicant denies that any implementation decisions were taken in relation to each member's account balance; rather, it asserts that the interest rate was applied to each member's account balance by a process more accurately described as an administrative or mechanical function. The necessary factual or evidentiary basis for these contentions is entirely absent.\\n\\n53 These conclusions are supported by the analysis in Employers First . In Employers First , the trustee issued member statements to a particular member, Mr Barratt, for the years ended 30 June 1995, 1996 and 1997 in which it calculated his retirement benefit by aggregating the defined benefit calculated under r 4 of the trust deed and the superannuation guarantee contributions that had been paid in respect of his membership of the fund. However, on Mr Barratt's retirement, the trustee notified him that the only lump sum retirement benefit to which he was entitled was that calculated under r 4 of the trust deed. In the course of her reasons, Branson J concluded that the retirement benefits to which Mr Barratt was entitled were only those prescribed by r 4: at 370 [60]-[61]. But, in the result, Branson J remitted the matter to the Tribunal for rehearing and determination on the ground that Mr Barratt had been denied procedural fairness in the course of the review process.\\n\\n54 Branson J held that the Tribunal's jurisdiction was not excluded by s 14(6). Her Honour said at 372-373 [74]-[76]:\\n 'It appears that there is no judicial authority on the proper interpretation of s 14(6) of the [ROC Act]. It seems clear, however, that the subsection is concerned with the nature of the complaint made under the section, rather than with the nature of the determination reached by the Tribunal on that complaint. A clear example of a complaint that relates to the management of a fund as a whole would be a complaint concerning the investment policy being adopted by the trustee of the fund. \\n \\n In this case Mr Barratt complained about the amount of the lump sum retirement benefit to which the Trustee had decided that he was entitled on his retirement. Mr Barratt founded his complaint upon the Member Statements. The Member Statements were concerned with his particular entitlement under the Plan. \\n \\n I conclude that, on its proper construction, s 14(6) of the [ROC Act] did not prohibit the Tribunal from dealing with Mr Barratt's complaint. It is not necessary for me to hazard a comprehensive definition of a complaint that relates to the management of a fund as a whole within the meaning of s 14(6) of the [ROC Act].'\\n\\n55 Before me, the applicant submitted that Employers First is distinguishable. Alternatively, it submitted that I should find that Branson J's observations concerning s 14(6) were wrong or need not be followed on the grounds that they were unnecessary to her decision. I reject these submissions.\\n\\n56 According to the applicant, Employers First can be distinguished on the basis that the gravamen of Mr Barratt's complaint was that he was entitled to receive a lump sum retirement benefit that was consistent with the information previously provided to him in member statements (at 364 [35]); whereas the gravamen of the respondents' Complaints is that the word 'interest' in cl C.4.10 of the Deed bears a particular meaning such that it can only be positive. The applicant also submitted that it is unrealistic to characterise each respondent's Complaint as one relating to the debit applied to his or her individual account.\\n\\n57 In my opinion, the supposed distinctions are fallacious. Each respondent sought to review the applicant's decision to reduce his or her benefits by an amount that was variously said to be a negative investment return or negative interest. Each such decision related to the particular member and to his or her entitlements. That position is not altered or denied by the fact that the respondents argue that the applicant had no power under cl C.4.10 of the Deed to effect the debits to their accounts, or to apply a negative investment return or negative crediting rate to all deferred benefit members. Like Mr Barratt, the respondents complain about the amount of their benefits, as notified by member statements. More particularly, they complain that the applicant unlawfully reduced the amount of their benefits.\\n\\n58 The contention that Branson J's observations need not be followed because they were obiter dicta is unsound. Her Honour's conclusions concerning jurisdiction were integral to her decision and to the order she made remitting the matter back to the Tribunal for hearing and determination according to law.\\n\\n59 Another reason why s 14(6) is inapplicable is that, in my opinion, a Complaint that the Deed has been contravened in a way that directly and adversely affects the financial position of the particular member lodging the Complaint cannot be described as a complaint about 'the management of a fund as a whole'. This is so even if it be assumed that the Complaints should be characterised in the way the applicant contends, ie as relating only to the question whether the debiting of interest contravened cl C.4.10 of the Deed. If the Complaints are upheld and if the applicant has in fact debited interest in contravention of cl C.4.10 of the Deed, that action could hardly be described as one relating to the management of the Fund as a whole. The Complaints are substantive and genuine and the applicant did not suggest otherwise. It follows, in my view, that the nature of the Complaints is such that they fall squarely within the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\\n\\n60 The Tribunal concluded that the word 'interest' in cl C.4.10 of the Deed does not, on its proper construction, contemplate 'negative interest'. It was common ground that this construction involves a question of law.\",\"1\":\"2 Section 46(1) of the ROC Act empowers a party to appeal to this Court, on a question of law, from a determination of the Tribunal.

Secondly, by virtue of s 37(5), the Tribunal must not do anything under s 37(3) that would be contrary to law or to the governing rules of the fund concerned. Thirdly, in accordance with s 37(6), the Tribunal must affirm the decision if it is satisfied that the decision, in its operation in relation the member bringing the complaint, was fair and reasonable in the circumstances.\\n\\n33 The Tribunal made Determinations pursuant to s 37(3) of the ROC Act in relation to the Complaints that:\\n (a) the Complaints related only to whether the applicant treated the respondents fairly and reasonably and were therefore within the Tribunal's jurisdiction;\\n (b) the decision of the applicant was unfair and unreasonable in its operation in relation to the respondents in the circumstances; and\\n (c) the decision under review would be set aside and the Tribunal would substitute its own decision for that of the applicant, namely that the applicant repay to the respondents' deferred benefit accounts all amounts of 'negative interest' deducted and interest calculated at the trustee's reasonable determination of the rate obtainable from investment in cash and bank bills from the date the deduction was made to the date of repayment.\",\"5\":\"31 The Tribunal conducts a form of administrative review.

The primary object of statutory construction is to construe the relevant provision so that it is consistent with the language and purpose of all the provisions of the statute: Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Association [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at 381 [69] - [70] per McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ.\",\"17\":\"68 In Collector of Customs v Agfa-Gevaert Ltd [1996] HCA 36 ; (1996) 186 CLR 389 at 398, Brennan CJ, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ cited with approval the statement of Lord Simon of Glaisdale in Maunsell v Olins [1975] AC 373 who said at 391:\\n 'Statutory language, like all language, is capable of an almost infinite gradation of \\\"register\\\"- ie, it will be used at the semantic level appropriate to the subject matter and to the audience addressed (the man in the street, lawyers, merchants, etc). It is the duty of a court of construction to tune in to such register and so to interpret the statutory language as to give to it the primary meaning which is appropriate in that register (unless it is clear that some other meaning must be given in order to carry out the statutory purpose or to avoid injustice, anomaly, absurdity or contradiction). In other words, statutory language must always be given presumptively the most natural and ordinary meaning which is appropriate in the circumstances.' \\n\\n\\nThe notion of a practical and purposive approach to construction, rather than a detached and literal one, is entirely compatible with the view that language should be given presumptively the most natural and ordinary meaning which is appropriate in the circumstances. I propose to approach the construction of the Deed, and the meaning of the word 'interest', with these principles in mind.\\n\\n69 It is convenient to commence with the language, structure and purposes of cl C.4.10 of the Deed. Under cl C.4.10, a member who resigns his or her employment before attaining 55 years and who elects to accept a deferred retirement benefit (as each of the respondents did) thereupon becomes entitled to a retirement benefit calculated under cl C.4.2 of the Deed. The structure of paragraphs (a) and (b) of cl C.4.10 makes it plain that the deferred retirement benefit falls 'due' when the employee makes his or her election. However, the benefit does not become payable before the member attains the age of 55 years, unless one of the conditions set out in cl C.4.10(b) is met.

The short point is that the drafters of the Deed could have specifically included a provision in cl C.4.10 entitling the applicant to deduct negative interest (as defined) from a member's deferred retirement benefit, but they did not do so. However, given the history of the LAS Act and the Deed and the way in which different divisions have been introduced at different times to accommodate different sub-schemes, I would treat the point very cautiously.\\n\\n96 The applicant also sought, somewhat inconsistently, to gather some support for its construction of cl C.4.10 from these other provisions. It pointed out that each of cll B.3.2, D.4.5, G.2.2 and H.4.2 provided for a crediting of interest at the declared rate (if positive) and a debiting of interest at the declared rate (if negative). It submitted that these provisions show that the Deed contemplates the concept of negative interest. In my opinion, these provisions do not assist the proper construction of cl C.4.10. They simply show that it is possible to adopt special definitions that alter the ordinary meaning of a word such as 'interest', and to use those definitions for specified purposes.\"}}"
