[[2006] HCA 27 at [69-71]]\\n\\nAlthough as a general rule the applicants are entitled to bring their claims before the Court and have their claims heard, as I have already noted this entitlement is subject to principles in respect of abuse of court process. In reviewing the material before me however, I keep in mind the warning of Dixon J in Cox v Journeaux and approach the matter with caution.\\n\\nKey questions of evidence before the Court, for the purposes of this analysis, may be summarised as follows: 1. What is the likelihood of Mr Allan Hockey giving evidence? 2. To paraphrase Bryson JA in Batistatos , is there useful evidence available upon which to conduct a trial, or is the position that a trial of the proceedings could not rise above a debate about the effect of scraps of information with the result that no more than a formal enactment of the process of hearing and determining the plaintiff's claim could take place? This second question should be particularly considered in light of evidence to which the applicants refer, including: A) Records before the Court, as contained in the affidavit of Mr David Sutton sworn 22 November 2005, and the further evidence given by Mr Sutton arising from cross-examination on 17 July 2006. B) The affidavit of Mr Patrick Killoran sworn 12 May 2006. C) Affidavits of Sir Llewellyn Edwards, Hugh Lionel Fawsett and Sir Leo Arthur Hielscher. d) Queensland Government Cabinet documents from the relevant period. E) Affidavits of Bernadette Irene Albert, Evelyn May Barker, Shane Arthur O'Connor, Eric Michael Porter, Maxwell Athol Smith and Paul Toolis.\\n\\nIt is clear that obtaining evidence from Mr Hockey would be very important to the conduct of this case from the perspective of both the applicants and the respondents. Mr Hockey was appointed Acting Superintendent of the Doomadgee Aboriginal Mission Reserve from 1 November 1958. I understand he remained in that management position until some time in 1983, and that he eventually left Doomadgee on 6 April 1983. His management role means that he would be able to give key evidence as to the role of the respondent in the conduct of the Doomadgee Mission over that period, and to explain relevant documents and records from that period. The importance of that evidence is enhanced by the fact that a number of key witnesses involved in the management of Doomadgee mission, and liaison between the Doomadgee Mission and the respondent during the relevant period have died (for example, Mrs Hockey and Mr Bedford), or are elderly, frail and unable to give evidence (for example, Mr Killoran).\\n\\nIt is clear however that Mr Hockey himself is now elderly, and in frail health.\\n\\nAt the hearing on 14 July 2006 the ability of Mr Allan Hockey to give evidence at a hearing of the substantive matter was in dispute. Counsel for the applicants indicated that he had spoken with a third party who had been in contact with acquaintances of Mr Hockey, and was able to provide evidence that Mr Hockey was capable of giving evidence relevant to the issues in dispute. I indicated that, if this were the case, the best evidence would be that from Mr Hockey himself. I adjourned the hearing to allow the parties the opportunity to contact Mr Hockey and ascertain his ability to give evidence, whether at the hearing itself, by a preservation of evidence hearing, by affidavit or otherwise.\",\"5\":\"As the Court of Appeal of New South Wales pointed out ([2005] NSWCA 20 at [13]): \\u2022 grounds (i) and (iii) were the same in substance, as there was no suggestion that the proceedings in Batistatos were an abuse of process other than because the defendants were irretrievably prejudiced by reason of the delay in the proceedings being brought; and \\u2022 ground (ii) indicated reliance by the defendants on the power of the Court to summarily dispose of proceedings in Pt 13 r 5, the test for which was whether the case was so clearly untenable that it could not possibly succeed (Barwick CJ in General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; [1964] 112 CLR 125 at 129-130).\",\"6\":\"I am not required at this stage to consider whether s 46PR HREOC Act would be of assistance to the applicants, or whether comments of the Full Court in Hagan v Trustees of the Toowoomba Sports Ground Trust (2001) FCA 123 at 20 would be relevant in relation to the evidence which the applicants would seek to elicit from Mr Hockey. However it is, in my opinion, important to consider realistically what evidence is before or likely to come before the Court.\\n\\nFrom the evidence of Dr Illes, it appears that even non-traditional questioning of Mr Hockey could be harmful to his health. On the facts before me I am of the view that Mr Hockey would not be able to give evidence in any form capable of being used by this Court, whether by affidavit, elicited by examination and cross-examination or otherwise as foreshadowed by Mr O'Gorman, or in person, by telephone or otherwise.\\n\\nThe ability of Mr Hockey to give evidence could be critical in that he could potentially explain such documents as exist relating to the management and operations of Doomadgee Mission. He appears to be the only person living with an intimate knowledge of the management of Doomadgee Mission during the relevant period, or who has the first hand knowledge to be in a position to explain documents relating to management of the Mission during that time.\",\"7\":\"In delivering the lead judgment of the Court of Appeal, Bryson JA noted that, notwithstanding that the relevant limitation periods applicable to the plaintiff had not expired, it was nonetheless competent for the Court to entertain an application for a permanent stay on the proceedings due to effluxion of time ([2005] NSWCA 20 at 51-52, 57, citing McHugh JA in Herron v McGregor (1986) 6 NSWLR 246 at 253-255).\",\"8\":\"It is clear that superior courts of justice, including the Federal Court of Australia, have the power to control and supervise proceedings brought within their jurisdiction, including the power to stay proceedings which are an abuse of process (cf Jago v District Court (NSW) [1989] HCA 46 ; (1989) 168 CLR 23 per Mason CJ at 25, 28, Deane J at 58, Gaudron J at 74, 76; Williams v Spautz [1992] HCA 34 ; (1991-1992) 174 CLR 509 at 518 per Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and McHugh JJ; Walton v Gardiner [1992] HCA 12 ; (1992-1993) 177 CLR 378 at 393; Lord Diplock in Hunter v Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police (1982) AC 529 at 536; Miller v University of New South Wales [2003] FCAFC 180 at [77-81] ; and note the consideration of this issue by the majority of the High Court in Batistatos v Road Traffic Authority of New South Wales [2006] HCA 27 at [5-8] and by Kirby J at [121-128]).\",\"9\":\"The nature of the power to grant a permanent stay of proceedings itself reveals an important principle which confines its exercise namely that the power is, in essence, a power to refuse to exercise jurisdiction.

Bryson JA considered that the information in the affidavits of the three 'new' witnesses was 'extremely slight and goes no real distance at all to establishing in any concrete way the state of affairs in which the accident happened in 1965...

Development continues.' \\n\\n\\n(Note similar comments of Lord Diplock in Hunter v Chief Constable of West Midlands Police at 536, Richardson J in Reid v New Zealand Trotting Conference [1984] 1 NZLR 8 at 9.)\\n\\nIn Batistatos , their Honours considered earlier decisions where abuse of process in the sense of abuse of court process was discussed, and observed that circumstances where courts have formed the view that conduct constituted abuse of process included where: \\u2022 proceedings were pending in another forum \\u2022 proceedings were instituted for an improper or illegitimate purpose \\u2022 proceedings were seriously and unfairly burdensome, prejudicial or damaging, including where there had been an unreasonable delay in commencing proceedings \\u2022 proceedings were of serious and unjustified trouble and harassment \\u2022 the use of the court's procedures would bring the administration of justice into disrepute \\u2022 proceedings were frivolous or vexatious \\u2022 there was no triable issue \\u2022 it was impossible for the defendants to obtain a fair trial in the circumstances of the case.\",\"17\":\"Whether an employer\\/employee relationship exists between parties is determined by the nature of their relationship and whether indicia of employment are evident. This issue has been the subject of much judicial comment. The leading Australian case on the topic is Stevens v Brodribb Sawmilling Company Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 1 ; (1986) 160 CLR 16 per Mason J at 24 and Wilson and Dawson JJ at 36, recently considered by the Full Court of the Federal Court in ACT Visiting Medical Officers Association v Australian Industrial Relations Commission [2006] FCAFC 109 at [19-21] , where incidents of the employment relationship were identified as: \\u2022 the measure of control that the putative employer is entitled to exercise over the worker \\u2022 the mode of remuneration \\u2022 the provision and maintenance of equipment \\u2022 the obligation to work \\u2022 the hours of work \\u2022 the provision for holidays \\u2022 the deduction of income tax \\u2022 the delegation of work \\u2022 the right to have a particular person do the work \\u2022 the right to suspend or dismiss the person engaged \\u2022 the right to the exclusive services of the person engaged \\u2022 the right to dictate the place of work.\",\"18\":\"The reference to 'contract for services' in s 3(1) is to the traditional distinction at common law between an 'employee' who was employed under a 'contract of service', and an independent contractor who was engaged under a 'contract for services'. Historically, employers could be liable for wrongs inflicted on a third party by an employee, but not where the worker was an independent contractor (see for example B Creighton and A Stewart Labour Law: An Introduction (The Federation Press, 2000) pars 7.02-7.06 and the recent discussion of these principles by the High Court in Sweeney v Boylan Nominees Pty Ltd [2006] HCA 19 ; (2006) 227 ALR 46 at 49). This distinction is not relevant in the case before me the only point is whether the applicants were employees of the respondent at the relevant time.\",\"19\":\"This comment appears equally relevant today: one of the few cases considering s 9 in isolation is Macedonian Teachers' Association of Victoria Inc v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (1998) 91 FCR 8 per Weinberg J, confirmed on appeal as Victoria v Macedonian Teachers' Association of Victoria Inc [1999] FCA 1287 ; (1999) 91 FCR 47. In that case, Weinberg J at first instance found inter alia that: \\u2022 'based on' in s 9(1) encompasses the broader, non-necessarily causative, relationship expressed in the phrase 'by reference to' \\u2022 motive, intention or purpose are irrelevant under s 9(1).\",\"20\":\"It is clear that superior courts of justice, including the Federal Court of Australia, have the power to control and supervise proceedings brought within their jurisdiction, including the power to stay proceedings which are an abuse of process (cf Jago v District Court (NSW) [1989] HCA 46 ; (1989) 168 CLR 23 per Mason CJ at 25, 28, Deane J at 58, Gaudron J at 74, 76; Williams v Spautz [1992] HCA 34 ; (1991-1992) 174 CLR 509 at 518 per Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and McHugh JJ; Walton v Gardiner [1992] HCA 12 ; (1992-1993) 177 CLR 378 at 393; Lord Diplock in Hunter v Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police (1982) AC 529 at 536; Miller v University of New South Wales [2003] FCAFC 180 at [77-81] ; and note the consideration of this issue by the majority of the High Court in Batistatos v Road Traffic Authority of New South Wales [2006] HCA 27 at [5-8] and by Kirby J at [121-128]).\\n\\nApplications for permanent stay based on effluxion of time appear to be rare (note comments of Bryson JA in Newcastle City Council v Batistatos [2005] NSWCA 20 at 56). The issue has however been the subject of comment by the High Court of Australia in the context of criminal proceedings ( Jago ), in relation to tribunal deliberations ( Walton v Gardiner ), and recently in relation to civil proceedings ( Batistatos ).\",\"21\":\"It is clear that superior courts of justice, including the Federal Court of Australia, have the power to control and supervise proceedings brought within their jurisdiction, including the power to stay proceedings which are an abuse of process (cf Jago v District Court (NSW) [1989] HCA 46 ; (1989) 168 CLR 23 per Mason CJ at 25, 28, Deane J at 58, Gaudron J at 74, 76; Williams v Spautz [1992] HCA 34 ; (1991-1992) 174 CLR 509 at 518 per Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and McHugh JJ; Walton v Gardiner [1992] HCA 12 ; (1992-1993) 177 CLR 378 at 393; Lord Diplock in Hunter v Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police (1982) AC 529 at 536; Miller v University of New South Wales [2003] FCAFC 180 at [77-81] ; and note the consideration of this issue by the majority of the High Court in Batistatos v Road Traffic Authority of New South Wales [2006] HCA 27 at [5-8] and by Kirby J at [121-128]).\"}}"
