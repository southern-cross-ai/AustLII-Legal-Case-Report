In particular, \\\"capitalists\\\" could no longer take an interest in a patent, save as assignee. Nor could a patent be granted to the \\\"importer\\\" of an invention unless he had the consent of the inventor. Moreover, one necessary consequence of the adoption (with the limited exception of the importer with consent) of the US model was that a patent that was granted to one of two inventors was not granted to the \\\"actual inventor\\\". Nor was a patent granted to the \\\"actual inventor\\\" if it was granted jointly to two or more persons one of whom was not the inventor. The position must be the same under the 1990 Act for there is no material difference in language. This conclusion accords with the result in Davies Shephard Pty Ltd v Stack [2001] FCA 501 ; (2001) 51 IPR 513, although I have reached it by a different process of reasoning.\\n\\n17 The respondents say that even if the grant be contrary to s 15, the patents in suit cannot be revoked. They put the argument as follows. First, the power to revoke is to be found in s 138(3). That sub-section provides that the court may revoke a patent on any of the following grounds: \\n \\n (a) that the patentee is not entitled to the patent; \\n (b) that the invention is not a patentable invention; \\n (c) that the patentee has contravened a condition in the patent; \\n \\n \\n (d) that the patent was obtained by fraud, false suggestion or misrepresentation; \\n (e) that an amendment of the patent request or the complete specification was made or obtained by fraud, false suggestion or misrepresentation; \\n (f) that the specification does not comply with subsection 40(2) or (3). \\n \\n \\n\\nThe next step is that, seeing that it is permissible to issue a patent to joint inventors, the words \\\"the patentee is\\\" in s 138(3)(a) must, in the case of a joint grant, be read as \\\"the patentees are\\\" (see also s 23 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth)). The conclusion that is then said to follow is that a patent can only be revoked under paragraph (a) if all \\\"the patentees [are] not entitled to the patent.\\\"\\n\\n18 I do not agree with this construction of s 138(3)(a). I accept, as I obviously must, that in the case of a joint patent it is proper to read s 138(3)(a) as covering joint patentees. Nonetheless, such a reading does not carry the respondents' argument. If one of several patentees is not entitled to the patent, then it is still correct to say (as it would be in the case where none of the patentees were entitled) that \\\"the patentees are not entitled to the patent\\\".\",\"7\":\"20 In any event, if s 138(3)(a) were not available to the applicant, it might rely on s 138(3)(d) and contend that if its assertions of fact are proven at trial the grant was obtained by \\\"false suggestion or misrepresentation\\\". As to the availability of false suggestion in the circumstances see Minter v Wells (1834) 1 WPC 127; R v Mussary (1834) 1 WPC 41; Earl of Devonshire's Case (1687) 11 Co 90.\",\"8\":\"14 The application of these principles leads inevitably to the following rules which, I am entitled to assume, were likely known to Mr Higgins.

They are decisions which consider the Patents clause of the US Constitution , Art I SS 8 , cl 8 (giving Congress the power to secure to \\\"inventors\\\" the \\\"exclusive right to their discoveries\\\") and, in some instances, the early US patent statutes (under which a patent could be granted to the person who \\\"hath or have invented or discovered\\\" (1790), or had \\\"invented\\\" (1793), or had \\\"discovered or invented\\\" (1836), a new and useful art). There are three decisions of the US Supreme Court that are likely candidates. The first is Gibbons v Ogden , 22 US 1 (1824). This was not a patent case but it did discuss the Patents clause in the following passage from the judgment of the court (at 58-59) delivered by Chief Justice Marshall: \\n \\n \\\"The power, as granted in the constitution, is a limited power. It is a clear principle, that when the means of executing any given power are specified in the grant, Congress cannot take, by implication, any other means, as being necessary and proper to carry that power into execution. This power, then, is limited: (1) As to the persons and objects in regard to which it may be exercised: these are, 'authors and inventors, writings and discoveries.' This enumeration excludes all right in Congress to legislate on the subject of any improvement, which is not an 'invention', either domestic or foreign. It excludes also all right to legislate for the benefit of any person who is not himself 'the inventor'. (2) As to the means of executing the power, and the time during which those means may be exercised. They are by 'securing the exclusive right for limited times.'\\\"\",\"10\":\"14 The application of these principles leads inevitably to the following rules which, I am entitled to assume, were likely known to Mr Higgins.

I am far from persuaded that this construction is correct and it seems to be contrary to the views of Cooper J in Stack v Brisbane City Council (1999) 47 IPR 525, 536 and Crennan J in JMBV Enterprises Pty Ltd v Camoflag Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1474 , [130]-[131].
