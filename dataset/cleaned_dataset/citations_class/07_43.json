There is a constructional question whether the time limits for seeking quotations referred to in ss 723 and 724 are time limits which can be extended by the court under s 1322(4)(d). The power conferred by s 1322(4)(d) is to make an order 'extending the period for doing any act ... under the Act or in relation to a corporation'. Section 723(3) does not in terms impose an obligation to apply for quotation within 7 days after the date of the prospectus. Rather, it conditions the validity of the share issue or transfer in response to an application under the prospectus upon the application for quotation having been made within that time. I am satisfied, however, that the ordinary meaning of the words of s 1322(4)(d) can readily accommodate the extension of the period for making an application for quotation. The same is true in my opinion of the 7 day period referred to in s 724(1)(b).
