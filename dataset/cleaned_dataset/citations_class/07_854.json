Judges regularly refer to authoritative dictionaries such as the Macquarie Dictionary for the purpose of determining or confirming the meaning of English words. Indeed, the common law rule is that evidence is not admissible for the purpose of interpreting ordinary English words ( Camden v Commissioners of Inland Revenue [1914] 1 KB 641; Cross on Evidence , 6 th Australian Edition at [11010]). It is unnecessary to give consideration here to whether this rule has survived the enactment of the Evidence Act .\\n\\n28 It was open to the Federal Magistrate to refer to the above definitions. It goes without saying that it has always been open to the Minister's legal representatives to refer to them.\\n\\n29 The above definitions of 'Sindh' and 'Sindhi' confirm that an assertion by a citizen of India that he is a Sindhi is an assertion of geographic significance; it is a statement that his, or his family's, geographic origin is in Sindh province which now forms part of Pakistan. The above definition of 'caste' confirms that an assertion by a Hindu that he is of a particular caste is an assertion of social significance; it is a statement as to the social class into which, as a Hindu, he was born. The Tribunal plainly understood that the appellant claimed to be of the Dalit caste and that Dalit is a low caste.\",\"1\":\"47 Order 52 r 36 of the Federal Court Rules , subject to any dispensation from compliance (see O 1 r 8), governs the practice of the Court where further evidence is sought to be adduced on appeal. Ordinarily the Court requires an application to adduce further evidence on appeal to be supported by an affidavit that explains why the further evidence was not adduced below ( Fodare Pty Limited v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy [2000] FCA 1721). However, I accept the submissions of the appellant's legal representative that the circumstances in which this Court, in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction, may receive evidence not adduced below are to be determined as a matter of statutory construction rather than by reference to common law principles ( CDJ v VAJ [1998] HCA 76 ; (1998) 197 CLR 172 per McHugh, Gummow and Callinan JJ esp at [100]-[102]). The interests of justice must always be the paramount consideration ( State of Queensland v JL Holdings Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 1 ; (1997) 189 CLR 146 at 155).\",\"2\":\"51 In the circumstances the Tribunal was required to determine whether low caste Hindus (ie Dalits) were capable of constituting a social group for the purposes of the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees 1951 as amended by the Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees 1967 (together 'the Convention'). If it answered that question affirmatively, it was required to determine whether the appellant was a member of that social group. If it answered that question affirmatively, it had then to deal with the questions whether the appellant feared persecution if he returned to India, whether his fear was well-founded and whether his fear was by reason of his membership of the social group constituted by Dalits ( Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 26 ; (2003) 197 ALR 389 per Gummow and Callinan JJ, with whom Hayne J agreed, at [26]).\\n\\n52 The reasons for decision of the Tribunal reveal that it did not follow the above process of reasoning. Rather it either accepted or assumed that the appellant was a member of a social group for the purposes of the Convention. It seems that the social group that it had in mind was either constituted by, or included in its membership, both Sindhis and Dalits as it proceeded on the basis that it was essentially the same to be a Sindhi and a Dalit. It then had regard to information concerning the treatment in India of members of the Sindhi community, including information which suggested that, generally speaking, the Sindhi community in Maharashtra State is not ill-treated. It thereafter noted, and apparently accepted, an Amnesty International report that Dalits 'are routinely subjected to beatings, mutilation, murder, rape, and destruction of property' . It then concluded, consistently with its assumption that it was essentially the same to be a Sindhi and a Dalit, that it was:\\n \\n 'not satisfied that being low caste (Dalit and Sindhi), without more, means that there is a real chance of the [appellant] being persecuted as contemplated by the Convention, by the Shiv Sena, and\\/or the Indian authorities, and\\/or upper caste people.'\\n\\n53 In my view, it is plain that because the Tribunal proceeded on the basis that it was essentially the same to be a Sindhi and a Dalit, it took into account material concerning the treatment in India of Sindhis when determining whether the appellant had a well-founded fear of persecution for reason of his membership of a particular social group. In doing so the Tribunal misunderstood and failed properly to deal with the claim advanced by the appellant. The social group of which the appellant is to be understood to have claimed membership was constituted by Dalits only; it did not include all Sindhis. Dalits and Sindhis are not the same and, as I have concluded above, the appellant did not assert that they are the same. In proceeding as it did the Tribunal constructively failed to exercise its jurisdiction because it did not address the claim advanced by the appellant ( Dranichnikov 197 ALR at [25]-[32]).\\n\\n54 In retrospect it can be seen that both the Minister and the appellant could have provided greater assistance to the Federal Magistrate. His Honour would almost certainly have benefited from evidence of the kind now contained in the affidavit of Professor Jayaraman. However, more informal ways of clarifying the meaning of the terms Sindhi and Dalit were open to the parties.\\n\\n55 For the reasons outlined above his Honour erred in concluding that the Tribunal addressed the claim advanced by the appellant. The first ground of appeal is made out.\\n\\n56 The second ground of appeal is properly understood, it seems to me, as an alternate ground to the first ground of appeal. On the assumption, which is contrary to my finding, that the Tribunal did recognise that being a Sindhi and being a Dalit was not essentially the same, it made no finding as to why, having regard to the Amnesty International report which it apparently accepted, the appellant did not have a well-founded fear of persecution as a member of the social group constituted by Dalits. The explanation for its apparent failure to apply the real chance test in this regard is to be found, in my view, in its failure to distinguish between the two social groups, Sindhis and Dalits.\\n\\n57 The appeal will be allowed and the orders made by the Federal Magistrates Court on 18 January 2007 set aside. In lieu thereof it will be ordered that orders issue in the nature of certiorari quashing the decision of the Tribunal and in the nature of mandamus requiring the Tribunal to determine the appellant's application for review of the decision of the delegate of the Minister according to law. The first respondent will be ordered to pay the appellant's costs in the Federal Magistrates Court and on appeal.\\n\\n I certify that the preceding fifty-seven (57) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Branson. \\n\\n\\n Associate:\\n\\nDated: 8 June 2007\\n\\n\\n Counsel for the Appellant: Mr T Silva \\n \\n Solicitor for the Appellant: Silva Solicitors \\n \\n Counsel for the First Respondent: \\n Ms SA Sirtes \\n \\n Solicitor for the First Respondent: \\n Clayton Utz \\n \\n Counsel for the Second Respondent: \\nThe Second Respondent filed a submitting appearance \\n \\n Date of Hearing: 2 May 2007 and 28 May 2007 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 8 June 2007 \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2007\\/854.html\",\"3\":\"47 Order 52 r 36 of the Federal Court Rules , subject to any dispensation from compliance (see O 1 r 8), governs the practice of the Court where further evidence is sought to be adduced on appeal.
