In the exercise of the power conferred by s 25(2B)(b)(ii) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) (\\\"Federal Court of Australia Act\\\"), I thereupon dismissed the appeal : SZKRJ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 271. On 4 April 2008, the Appellant filed a notice of motion by which she sought that the orders made on 4 March 2008 be set aside and that appeal proceed. She filed an affidavit in support of that application that same day.\\n\\n3 The order which I made on 4 March 2008 was entered on 12 March 2008.\\n\\n4 The nature of today's application therefore is, in effect, for the reopening of the appeal as a consequence of a requested setting aside of an order of dismissal.\",\"1\":\"5 In SZHFE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2006] FCA 648 , Jacobson J had occasion to consider the power of the court to entertain a notice of motion to set aside an order dismissing an appeal where an Appellant had failed to appear. The circumstances of that case were slightly different to the present in this sense, in the proceedings before Jacobson J the application to set aside the dismissal order was filed before the entry of the dismissal order. As it happened, his Honour considered that there were two sources of power to set aside the dismissal order. One related to the fact that the application had been made before the formal entry of the order. That need not be explored further in the circumstances of this case. The nature of the other basis of power is neatly summarised by the following quote from his Honour's decision at para 4:\\n The second is an implied power under section 23 of the Act to overcome the court's failure to provide a party with a hearing; see Yevad Products Pty Limited v Brookfield [2005] FCAFC 263 at [26] - [33] and the authorities there cited; see also DJL v Central Authority (2000) 201 CLR 226 at [189].\\n\\n6 It was accepted by counsel appearing for the Minister that the Court has power to set aside the orders made by me on 4 March 2008. Having regard to the passage which I have quoted from Jacobson J's judgment and the authorities mentioned by his Honour, I am quite satisfied that this concession was appropriately made in law.\\n\\n7 The principles to be applied in relation to the consideration of an application of this kind are, in my opinion, as follows: \\n \\n1. is there a satisfactory explanation in respect of the failure to attend at the time and place appointed for the hearing of the appeal; \\n \\n2. what are the merits of the prospective appeal in the sense that, does it enjoy at least a reasonable prospect of success.\\n\\n8 Though separate, those considerations are not unrelated in the sense that a case which had patent merit might well attract a favourable exercise of the power to set aside a dismissal order, even though one might have reservations as to whether the explanation for absence was satisfactory. The prejudice occasioned by the initial failure to attend in such circumstances to the Respondent party could be ameliorated by an appropriate order in respect of costs, were the appeal successful. I proceed then to consider the application having regard to each of the considerations that I have mentioned.\"}}"
