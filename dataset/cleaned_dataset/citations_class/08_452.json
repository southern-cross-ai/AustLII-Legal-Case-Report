An order was also made for payment by Mr Croker of the costs of the Commonwealth.\",\"3\":\"46 The written submissions include reference to the Legal Services Directions 2005 , Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) and to the 'Model Litigant' responsibility referred to in Re Summers and Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2005] AATA 125. Mr Croker submits that the standard of fair dealing which was referred to in such authorities applies to the Commonwealth as a model litigant.\\n\\n47 The facts giving rise to Mr Croker's claim and the relief claimed in the current proceedings are, subject to the increase in damages claimed from $100,000 to $200,000, the same as those referred to in NSD 2478 of 2006 which were transferred to the Federal Magistrates Court and became proceedings SYG 548 of 2007.
