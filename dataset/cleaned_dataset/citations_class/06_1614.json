The Tribunal is entitled to form adverse conclusions as to the appellant's credibility on the evidence that the appellant presented. The finding of the appellant's credibility is a finding of fact, and it is well established that the Court cannot review the merits of the Tribunal's decision: Minister for Immigration & Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 272. In any event, there is no error of law, let alone a jurisdictional error, in the Tribunal making a wrong finding of fact: see Abebe v Commonwealth [1999] HCA 14 ; (1999) 197 CLR 510 at 560, [137] .\",\"1\":\"15 In my view, the evidence sought to be adduced would not be admissible in this proceeding, and in the course of the proceeding I so ruled. In an appropriate case it may well be permissible to tender evidence on review. However, whether it is an appropriate case will depend upon the grounds of review and the circumstances of the case. I refer to the judgment of Weinberg J in Australian Retailers Association v Reserve Bank of Australia [2005] FCA 1707 ; (2005) 148 FCR 446 where at 564, [454] he stated:\\n \\n I accept that, ordinarily, material not before the decision-maker at the time of the making of the decision will not be admissible in proceedings for judicial review.\",\"2\":\"9 In relation to the claim that the Tribunal was biased, there is no evidence to support such a finding.

The appellant's complaints do not rise above criticisms of the Tribunal's fact finding process. As such, these complaints cannot succeed: see NAMM of 2002 v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 32 at [46] .\\n\\n11 The affidavit in support of the notice of appeal seeks to make unparticularised complaints about the Tribunal's decision. It appears that the appellant is alleging, consistent with the only ground advanced before the Federal Magistrate, that the Tribunal breached s 424A of the Act when deciding his application.\\n\\n12 It is clear that the Tribunal considered and rejected the appellant's claims. It was satisfied that the appellant was not a Christian. The Tribunal specifically found that the appellant did not face any chance of persecution for reasons of his religion.\"}}"
