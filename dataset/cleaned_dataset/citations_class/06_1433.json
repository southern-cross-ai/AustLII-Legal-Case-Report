However, for my part, a surer foundation for dismissing the application is found in s 5 and not s 24. The DD Act is beneficial legislation. As Dawson and Gaudron JJ observed in IW v The City of Perth and Others [1997] HCA 30 ; (1997) 191 CLR 1 at 22:\\n \\n In construing legislation designed to protect basic human rights and dignity, the courts \\\"have a special responsibility to take account of and give effect to [its] purpose\\\". For this reason, the provisions of the Act concerned with discrimination in the provision of goods or services, including s 66K(1), should be construed as widely as their terms permit.\"}}"
