The appellant relied upon the transcript of the Tribunal hearing, noting in particular that the Tribunal questioned a witness relating to his impartiality. The appellant claimed that the issue of impartiality was not translated by the interpreter. His Honour found that there was no evidence to support such claim. His Honour referred to Tin v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1109 in finding that the Tribunal's view of the impartiality of a witness is part of the Tribunal's reasoning process and does not constitute information within the meaning of s 424A(1) of the Act. His Honour found that there was no obligation to provide the appellant with particulars of its opinion of the impartiality of a witness and dismissed this ground of appeal.\\n\\n12 The fifth ground of review arises out of an interview which was held between Australian officials in Beijing and the appellant's wife. The appellant had claimed that he was not married when he obtained his Preferential Relative (Migrant) visa. However, such claim was shown to be false during the subsequent interview with his wife. The Tribunal drew the inference that the details of such interview would have been conveyed to the appellant by the wife. The appellant challenged the drawing of such inference.\\n\\n13 Lloyd-Jones FM accepted that the Tribunal could draw the inference contained in the fifth ground of review, and that such inference was reasonably open to the Tribunal on the material before it. There was no need for direct evidence of specific communication before such an inference could have been drawn.\\n\\n28 The assessment of the credibility of a witness is a matter entirely for the determination of the Tribunal: see Tin [2000] FCA 1109 and does not form information for the purposes of s 424A(1) of the Act. The provisions of the Act are an exhaustive statement of the principles of natural justice and there is no scope for the application of any residue common law principles: see s 422B of the Act.\\n\\n29 There is no error as claimed, and Lloyd-Jones FM was correct in his conclusion that there was no denial of natural justice.\\n\\n30 The Tribunal accepted that the appellant engaged in some political activities in Australia but found that any such activities were engaged in for the purpose of enhancing his refugee claim. The Tribunal would pay no regard to such activities because they were activities which were excluded pursuant to s 91R(3) of the Act. The appellant submits that s 91R(3) does not exclude the possibility that an applicant may act with more than one purpose, so that if he or she engages in conduct to which s 91R(3) applies, there may be another purpose which has resulted in the conduct. It is alleged that the Tribunal failed to exclude such possibility of more than one purpose in its determination.\",\"13\":\"35 The Tribunal did not accept that the appellant did not know of the interview on 7 May 2003 between Australian Embassy officials in Beijing and the appellant's wife. Lloyd-Jones FM noted the evidence upon which the Tribunal could reach such conclusion, which included the sponsorship of the wife and child by the appellant. Contrary to the claim of the appellant, there was sufficient factual circumstances to warrant the inference by the Tribunal in making such finding: see Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321 at 356; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Al-Miahi (2001) 65 ALD 141 at [34]-[35]; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Rajamanikkam [2002] HCA 32 ; (2002) 210 CLR 222 at 232-233, 236, 240 and 259; VAAW of 2001 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 202 at [33] - [35] .
