He said, however, that where the parties are trade rivals, different considerations arise.\\n\\n15 What underlies Hayne JA's analysis is his statement that the principles of a trade rival cannot forget the secret information once it is revealed. Thus, the value of the commercially sensitive information will be lost unless it is protected by an appropriate access regime. The implied obligation not to use the documents other than for the purpose of the proceedings is thought to be insufficient, as between trade rivals, to permit unrestricted access.\\n\\n16 The balancing exercise to which Hayne JA referred in Mobil Oil at 39-40 involves weighing the needs of a party to litigation against the \\\"legitimate concern\\\" of a trade rival.\\n\\n17 The principal factors which inform the exercise of the discretion have been stated in the authorities.
