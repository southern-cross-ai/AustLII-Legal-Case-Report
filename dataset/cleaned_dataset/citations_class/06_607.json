I was not previously aware that the Queensland Police were investigating any threat made to or about me. It is not appropriate for me to disqualify myself in those circumstances. I need not disqualify myself because the applicant has brought to my attention the allegation that she has previously made a threat to me. As Mason J said in Re JRL; ex parte CJL [1986] HCA 39 ; (1986) 161 CLR 342 at 352:\\n \\n 'Although it is important that justice must be seen to be done, it is equally important that judicial officers discharge their duty to sit and do not, by acceding too readily to suggestions of appearance of bias encourage parties to believe that by seeking the disqualification of a judge, they will have had their case tried by someone thought to be more likely to decide the case in their favour.'\\n\\n7 I decline to disqualify myself for bias.\\n\\n8 The application for judicial review was listed for hearing today. There has been no appearance of the applicant. As I have said, there is no contradictor. Order 32 rule 2(1)(d) of the Federal Court Rules allows the Court to proceed in the absence of a party. In my opinion, it is appropriate that I proceed in this matter in the absence of the applicant. My reasons for judgment will show that, in my opinion, this application on any understanding is doomed to fail. It therefore should be disposed of as soon as possible.\",\"1\":\"37 Whether this application is brought under the Judiciary Act 1903 or the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 a grant of a remedy is discretionary.
