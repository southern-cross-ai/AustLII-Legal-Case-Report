See also s 163A of the TP Act.\\n\\nPlainly enough, for conduct to contravene s 52, it must convey a representation which is misleading or deceptive, or is likely to mislead or deceive. Putting aside the issue concerning the ticket machines, the council asserts that each of the ACF Notices conveyed the following representations: that the ACF Notices were issued or authorised by the Council, or that ACF was associated or affiliated with the Council; that the ACF Notices were issued for the recovery of a fine, expiation fee or other penalty imposed by law; that ACF was authorised by law to recover a fine, expiation fee or other penalty imposed by law; and that the claim in the ACF Notice was not in respect of an alleged contractual debt.\\n\\nAs the above discussion indicates, the dispute in this case turns upon whether those alleged representations were made. Neither ACF nor Park Fast have contended that the ACF Notices, if they conveyed those representations, were true. The case therefore is whether or not those representations were made.\",\"1\":\"Whether or not a representation is made, and is misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive, is a matter to be determined objectively by the Court.

The objective judgment is made in relation to the persons or class of persons who may be mislead by the relevant conduct. In Parkdale Gibbs CJ said at 199: \\n Section 52 does not expressly state what persons or class of persons should be considered as the possible victims for the purpose of deciding whether conduct is misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive. It seems clear enough that consideration must be given to the class of consumers likely to be affected by the conduct. Although it is true, as has often been said, that ordinarily a class of consumers may include the inexperienced as well as the experienced, and the gullible as well as the astute, the section must in my opinion by [sic] regarded as contemplating the effect of the conduct on reasonable members of the class.

The person in receipt of the representation must labour under some error: Taco at 200 . In reaching such a conclusion, it is appropriate to ignore assumptions that a member of the public may make which are extreme or fanciful. It is necessary to consider the likely reaction to the representations by ordinary or reasonable members of the class of persons to whom the representation is directed: Campomar Sociedad, Limitada v Nike International Ltd [2000] HCA 12 ; (2000) 202 CLR 45 ( Campomar ).

But here, ACF or its promoters selected a name which had those words and a descriptive noun in its name which carries particular connotations, but did so to enter a field of activity in which the Council for many years had carried on the function of imposing fines by its Expiation Notices: cf Aerospatiale Societe Nationale Industrielle v Aerospatiale Helicopters Pty Ltd (1986) 11 FCR 37.

There is no other explanation for the choice of the general layout and presentation of the first ACF Notice.
