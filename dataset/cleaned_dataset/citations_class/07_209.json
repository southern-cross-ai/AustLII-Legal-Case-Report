Rather, the grounds are directed to the decision of the Tribunal.\\n\\n13 The applicant alleges that the Tribunal failed to comply with sections 424A and 441A of the Act . This ground is unparticularised. The Tribunal as first constituted wrote to the applicant inviting his comment on two occasions. The Tribunal was not required to write to the applicant, as reconstituted, in respect of any information upon which it relied as its findings relied on the applicant's evidence given to the Tribunal, both as originally constituted and as reconstituted and the documents provided by the applicant to the Tribunal. Accordingly, there is no merit to this ground.\",\"1\":\"19 The fourth ground alleges that the Tribunal failed to consider evidence in favour of the applicant and that it only considered evidence which was not in favour of the applicant. To the extent that this is an allegation of bias the applicant has not met the requirement that such an allegation be firmly and distinctly made and clearly proved: Minister for Immigration & Multicultural Affairs v Jia Le Geng [2001] HCA 17 ; (2001) 205 CLR 507 at [530] .\\n\\n20 To the extent that the Tribunal, upon considering the evidence as a whole (which it expressly stated it had done) gave no weight to evidence on its face favourable to the applicant it did so because it found the applicant not to be a credible witness. No error and in particular no jurisdictional error arises by reason of that approach which was clearly open to it.\\n\\n21 Accordingly I am of the opinion that the Federal Magistrate's decision is not attended by sufficient doubt to warrant it being reconsidered by the Federal Court. Whilst the applicant disagrees with the decision below he has been unable to point to any relevant error. It is evident that no substantial injustice would result from my refusal of leave.\"}}"
