This conduct constituted more than simply taking advantage of a superior bargaining position but involved an unconscientious exploitation of another's inability or diminished ability to conserve his or her own interests. Dangling the 'employment carrot' in return for a fee in circumstances in which the applicant faces having to leave Australia, constitutes a high level of moral obloquy especially where the promised employment does not exist: Australian Competition & Consumer Commission v Chats House Investments (1996) 71 FCR 250.\\n\\nIn the circumstances, the ACCC submitted the Court should make a declaration in terms of para 1 of the amended application.\",\"2\":\"The power to make a declaration is a discretionary one and the basis upon which it should be exercised is conveniently summarised by Kenny J in Australian Competition & Consumer Commission v Henry Kaye and National Investment Institute Pty Limited [2004] FCA 1363 at [200] [201].
