Neither of these issues was referred to by the appellant. The first issue raised was whether the decision in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Al Shamry [2001] FCA 919 ; (2001) 110 FCR 27 applied in the present circumstances. Having regard to the cases referred to by counsel for the respondent, including the decisions of Gray J in M55 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 131 (\\\" M55 v MIMIA\\\") and the decision of Jacobson J in NAZY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 744 ( \\\"NAZY v MIMIA\\\") , I am persuaded that in the present case the material in the file which was before the Department was incorporated in the Application for Review to the RRT.\\n\\n6 Counsel has also referred me to the recent decision of the Full Court in a number of cases including SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 2 , which was handed down on 24 February 2006 after the decision of the Federal Magistrate in this matter. In my view, having looked at the reasons for judgment in that case, I am not persuaded that they vary the position in any way from the position taken in NAZY v MIMIA or in M55 v MIMIA . Accordingly, I do not consider that there is any basis for a contention that there has been a breach of s 424A.\",\"2\":\"3 Two other matters were raised by counsel for the respondent.
