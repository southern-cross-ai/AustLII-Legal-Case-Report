Section 131B(2) of the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) (' Copyright Act ') provides that an appeal lies from a decision of a Court of a State under Part V of the Copyright Act to the Federal Court of Australia. Section 39(2) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) provides that 'the several Courts of the States shall within the limits of their several jurisdictions, ... be invested with federal jurisdiction, in all matters in which the High Court has original jurisdiction or in which original jurisdiction can be conferred upon it ...'. The High Court has original jurisdiction in the five matters set out in s 75 of the Constitution . By s 76 of the Constitution , the Parliament may confer original jurisdiction on the High Court in any matter arising under any laws made by the Parliament (s 76(ii)). Additionally, by s 77(iii) of the Constitution , the Parliament may make laws investing any Court of a State with federal jurisdiction in respect of the nine matters identified in ss 75 and 76 of the Constitution . Since original jurisdiction can be conferred upon the High Court in any matter arising under the Copyright Act , s 39(2) invests the Magistrates Court of Queensland with federal jurisdiction in respect of a matter under Part V of the Copyright Act which includes s 115 of the Copyright Act conferring an entitlement upon the copyright owner to bring an action for infringement of copyright. The decision of her Honour was thus a decision under Part V of the Copyright Act and an appeal lies from that decision to the Federal Court of Australia ( Ly and Another v Jenkins and Others [2001] FCA 1640 ; (2001) 114 FCR 237 per Sackville J at [69] and following).\\n\\n6 The exercise of the Court's appellate jurisdiction contemplates applications for leave to appeal or for an extension of time within which to institute an appeal to the Court (s 25(2)(a) and (b)). By s 25(2A) , the rules of Court may make provision for applications to be dealt with of the kind mentioned in s 25(2). Order 52, rule 15(1)(a) provides that a notice of appeal shall be filed and served within 21 days after the date when the judgment appealed from was pronounced. The time limited for filing and serving a notice of appeal, in this case, expired on 10 April 2007. Order 52, rule 15(2) provides that the Court or a judge for 'special reasons' may at any time give leave to file and serve a notice of appeal which, in accordance with Form 54A and Order 52, rule 15(3) involves an application for an extension of time within which, by leave, to file and serve a notice of appeal. The notice of motion seeking an extension of time was filed on 13 December 2007 approximately eight months after the expiration of the time limited for filing and serving an appeal.\",\"1\":\"7 It is entirely uncontroversial that in considering an application to extend time to file and serve a notice of appeal, the Court will have regard to the length of the delay ( Jess v Scott (1986) 12 FCR 187 per Lockhart, Sheppard and Burchett JJ); the explanation for the delay and whether the applicant has contributed to the delay ( Stollznow v Calvert [1980] 2 NSWLR 749, per Moffit P); any prejudice to the respondents arising out of the delay ( Douglas v Allen (1984) 1 FCR 287 per Morling J;
