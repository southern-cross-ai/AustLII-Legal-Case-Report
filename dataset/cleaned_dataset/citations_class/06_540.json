The second agreement, which was said to be partially written, and partially oral, was entered into on or about 28 September 2001. That agreement, between Franklins and the applicant, involved them in jointly bringing proceedings, in the Supreme Court of Victoria, against the Lessor for unreasonably withholding consent to the assignment of the lease of the Mentone store to the applicant.

As advised on Friday, this looks like going full on legal if we don't quash their perceived options. \\n thanks, \\n Alan\\\"\\n\\n166 There is then a handwritten note on the print out of the email saying \\\"John Kop please call\\\". As previously mentioned, Mr Kop was the project manager for Project Lincoln within Coles.\\n\\n167 Under this is another handwritten note which states as follows:\\n \\n \\\"Alan, \\n Mary has spoken to Coles. Coles have done a deal in principle here, based on vacant possession. Mary has told Coles that Franklins is going to litigate & hopefully scared them off with the threat of tortious interference , let alone jeopardising our deal with Coles on the whole . \\n Jo.\\\" (emphasis added)\\n\\n195 Many of the documents upon which the applicant relied in support of its circumstantial case were prepared by people who would not have been directly involved in any negotiations that took place between Franklins and Coles, and may not have known what was happening at the level that counted. For example, the Turner document, though capable of having the sinister connotation that the applicant placed upon it, it also perfectly capable of being read in an innocent light. One interpretation of the document is that Ms Turner did not appreciate that the agreement to sell the first tranche of stores to Coles had already been finalised ten days earlier, and that was the \\\"deal with Coles on the whole\\\" to which she was referring. The fact that Ms Turner was not called to give evidence lends some support to the applicant's case regarding the interpretation to be given to this document. See generally Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298. However, that does not, in my view, override the highly favourable impression that I formed of Mr Cornell as a witness in this proceeding.\\n\\n196 It is arguable that the applicant has a stronger case in relation to its claim that the November 2001 dealings constituted a breach of Franklins' contractual obligations. The real substance of this claim is that Franklins \\\"jumped the gun\\\" in terms of seeking the ACCC's consent to sell the Mentone store to Coles, and in concluding an agreement with Coles to do so. It did both these things, according to the applicant, while it still owed obligations, both contractual and fiduciary, to the applicant.\\n\\n197 The Mentone BSA and the litigation agreement were both still on foot on 23 November 2001. Notice to terminate these agreements was not served until 28 November 2001. The Mentone BSA required seven business days notice to be terminated. Accordingly, the Mentone BSA remained on foot until 7 December 2001. However, in relation to the litigation agreement, the applicant accepts that it came to an end on 28 November 2001.\",\"12\":\"210 Second, the applicant contends that a duty to act in good faith should also be implied into the Mentone BSA generally, or into the right to terminate specifically.

His Honour said, at 255-6:\\n \\n \\\"Questions of construction and different kinds of implication tend to blur together. In recent years terms implied in contracts have been said to fall into two classes the first of which has come to be called, somewhat misleadingly, implication in fact, the second, implication by law. The so-called implication in fact is really implication by judge based on the judge's view of the actual intention of the parties drawn from the surrounding circumstances of the particular contract, its language, and its purposes, as they emerge from the language and in the circumstances. This has been called implication ad hoc (see Professor Lucke \\\"Ad Hoc Implications in Written Contracts\\\" (1973-1976) 5 Adelaide Law Review 32) a usage I will adopt.\\\"\\n\\n210 Second, the applicant contends that a duty to act in good faith should also be implied into the Mentone BSA generally, or into the right to terminate specifically.

The applicant contends that this term is to be implied by operation of law or, alternatively, on an ad hoc basis. It referred to Secured Income Real Estate (Australia) Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Ltd [1979] HCA 51 ; (1979) 144 CLR 596 at 607 per Mason J to support its contention.\",\"16\":\"209 In relation to the implied term not to deprive a party of the benefit of that agreement, the applicant relies upon Shepherd v Felt and Textiles of Australia Ltd [1931] HCA 21 ; (1931) 45 CLR 359 at 378, where Dixon J stated that the express promise of the appellant to use his best endeavours to obtain fabric orders for the respondent fabric manufacturer \\\"necessarily includes an obligation not to hinder or prevent the fulfilment of its purpose\\\". The applicant contends, by analogy, that the express promise of Franklins to use reasonable endeavours to satisfy the condition precedent necessarily includes an obligation not to hinder or prevent fulfilment of it.\",\"17\":\"217 The applicant relied upon the following passage in United Dominions Corporation Ltd v Brian Pty Ltd [1985] HCA 49 ; (1985) 157 CLR 1 at 12 per Mason, Brennan and Deane JJ to support its case:\\n \\n \\\"In particular, a fiduciary relationship with attendant fiduciary obligations may, and ordinarily will, exist between prospective partners who have embarked upon the conduct of the partnership business or venture before the precise terms of any partnership agreement have been settled. Indeed, in such circumstances, the mutual confidence and trust which underlie most consensual fiduciary relationships are likely to be more readily apparent than in the case where mutual rights and obligations have been expressly defined in some formal agreement. Likewise, the relationship between prospective partners or participants in a proposed partnership to carry out a single joint undertaking or endeavour will ordinarily be fiduciary if the prospective partners have reached an informal arrangement to assume such a relationship and have proceeded to take steps involved in its establishment or implementation.\\\"\\n\\n218 The relationship between Franklins and the applicant was not one of \\\"mutual trust and confidence\\\". The arrangements between Franklins and the applicant concerning the efforts to obtain the consent of the Lessor to the assignment of the Mentone store lease had a singularly fragile quality. They could be terminated on short notice. At the first directions hearing in the Supreme Court proceedings on 19 October 2001, counsel then appearing for the applicant and Franklins submitted, in support of the application for expedition, that there was \\\"nothing to stop the parties walking away\\\". When counsel spoke of \\\"the parties\\\" he was referring to the applicant and Franklins. He also said that it was \\\"a fair inference, given the nature of the commercial dealings between the parties, that the matter is quite fragile\\\". That was an accurate statement of the parties' legal position vis-a-vis one another.\\n\\n219 The reality of the litigation agreement was that Franklins lent its name to the Supreme Court proceedings, but the applicant's solicitors, Mason Sier Turnball, and counsel conducted the proceedings, and the applicant funded them. However, at the same time, Franklins retained HWL to maintain what Mr Colbran QC, counsel for Franklins, described as a \\\"supervising brief\\\" over the proceedings.\"}}"
