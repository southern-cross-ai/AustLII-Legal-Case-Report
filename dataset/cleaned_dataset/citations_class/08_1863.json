Specifically, she alleged that she had been dismissed because of a temporary absence from work due to illness and because she had filed complaints against her employer alleging breaches of applicable laws. She commenced a proceeding in the Federal Magistrates Court in which she sought re-instatement to her former position, compensation and costs. At trial, she abandoned her claim for re-instatement and advised the Court that she sought compensation and an apology. The proceeding was dismissed by the Federal Magistrate: see Kang v Attorney-General's Department [2008] FMCA 638.\\n\\n3 The respondent (who was, by order of this Court, identified as the Commonwealth of Australia) opposed the application and sought its costs. The Federal Magistrate did not rule on the costs application.\\n\\n4 Ms Kang lodged an appeal in this Court. The Commonwealth cross-appealed on the costs issue. The Chief Justice directed, pursuant to s 25(1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) (\\\"the Federal Court Act \\\") that the appeal be heard and determined by a single judge.\",\"1\":\"24 The Federal Magistrate accepted that, once Ms Kang had made the allegation that Mr Kennedy had terminated her employment for one or more of the reasons identified in s 659(2)(a) and (e), the onus fell on the Commonwealth, under s 664 , to prove that the termination did not occur for a proscribed reason: see Zhang v The Royal Australian Chemical Institute Inc [2005] FCAFC 99 ; (2005) 144 FCR 347 at 350 [15] .\\n\\n25 The Federal Magistrate did not consider that Ms Kang had been dismissed because of absences due to illness. There was no reason why Mr Kennedy would have been aware of any of Ms Kang's absences because of illness. It had not been put to him that he was aware of any such absences or that he had acted because of them. His Honour rejected the claim, insofar as it was based on s 659(2)(e) on the basis that it was well settled that the paragraph did not apply where all that the employee had done was to make a complaint directly to his or her employer: see Zhang at [19]-[30]; Claveria v Pilkington Australia Ltd (2007) 167 IR 144 at [110]-[112]. All of Ms Kang's complaints about her treatment were directed to other officers within the Attorney-General's Department.\\n\\n38 In dealing with s 664 the Federal Magistrate directed himself consistently with the decision of a Full Court of this Court in Zhang at 350 [15], and the decision of O'Loughlin J in Robertson v South (2000) 140 IR 169 at 173 [16]. No error in his Honour's application of s 664 has been demonstrated.\\n\\n39 It is well established that s 659(2)(e) \\\"is directed to the making of complaints to outside authorities, either by way of instituting proceedings against an employer, or by way of making allegations to officials who are empowered to investigate such allegations. The ground would not be established by the making of complaints directly to the employer alone\\\": He v Lewin [2004] FCAFC 161 ; (2004) 137 FCR 266 at 280 [44] (per Gray and Mansfield JJ); Zhang at 350-352 [19]-[33].\",\"2\":\"25 The Federal Magistrate did not consider that Ms Kang had been dismissed because of absences due to illness.

The respondent contended that the proceeding in the Federal Magistrates Court had been instituted without reasonable cause and that it had no real prospects of success or was doomed to failure: see Council of Kangan Batman Institute of Technology and Further Education v Australian Industrial Relations Commission (2007) 237 ALR 672 at 685. This was because Ms Kang did not produce any evidence capable of supporting her application and because the case she presented to the Court amounted to a mere allegation which could be rebutted by a simple denial by the respondent.\\n\\n62 Ms Kang's application to the Federal Magistrates Court, insofar as it alleged a contravention of s 659(2)(e) , was bound to fail. Her own evidence established that she had not made any complaint to any external authority. In the absence of such a complaint, for reasons already given, she could not succeed.\\n\\n63 It cannot, however, in my opinion, be said that her complaint alleging a contravention of s 659(2)(a) had no prospects of success or was doomed to fail. Ms Kang gave undisputed evidence about a series of absences from work which commenced in mid February 2007. She was absent when the decision was made to terminate her employment. She had provided the Attorney-General's Department with medical certificates to explain her absences. This evidence alone was, of course, not sufficient to make good a claim of contravention of s 659(2)(a). It was, however, sufficient, having regard to the provisions of s 664(b) , to require more than a mere denial on the part of the respondent. The respondent did not, apparently, consider that a mere denial would suffice. It accepted that it was necessary to call Mr Kennedy to give evidence about when he made his decision, why he made it and his knowledge (or lack of it) of the medical certificates and Ms Kang's absences prior to his making the decision.\"}}"
