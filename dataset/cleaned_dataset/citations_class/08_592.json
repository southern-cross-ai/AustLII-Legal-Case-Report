A stay is an interlocutory order and a court must remain in control of its own interlocutory orders: Adam P Brown Male Fashions Proprietary Limited v Philip Morris Incorporated (1981) 148 CLR 170 at 178.\\n\\n118 There are two matters which have troubled me in exercising my jurisdiction to grant a stay. The first is the ordinary vicissitudes of litigation in another country. It may therefore be that, despite the views of Mr Smith, the US District Court will decline to apply the Trade Practices Act . If that were to occur, it may be appropriate to lift the stay. There may be other circumstances existing in the litigation in the United States which would also make it appropriate to consider such an application.\\n\\n119 The second is that, in my view, Smurfit is in clear breach of the Agreement in two respects. First, it has refused to submit to the jurisdiction of New South Wales by filing an appearance in this proceeding. On any view, it was bound to do so.\",\"1\":\"53 I also accept that it is entirely possible that at the final hearing the alleged representations will add little if anything to the claim for breach of contract: see Apscore International Pty Ltd v Grand Canyon Technologies Pty Ltd [1996] FCA 1089.\\n\\n54 However, the short answer to these submissions is to be found in Dr Bell's concession that the trade practices claim is not colourable. It follows from this that the Court has subject matter jurisdiction over the trade practices claim which has more than a trivial connection with the overall controversy. That is sufficient to warrant the grant of leave under O 8 r 3. The motion to set aside service thus ought to be refused.\\n\\n55 Whether there ought to be a stay depends upon the answers to the remaining questions.\",\"2\":\"17 The fifth issue is, whether in the event that Smurfit is unsuccessful on its motion, I ought to grant Armacel's motion for an anti-suit injunction. The principal question which arises under this issue is the stage that the US District Court proceeding has reached and whether to restrain it:\\n \\n ...would be not only invidious but the reverse of comity: Aggeliki Charis Compania Maritima SA v Pagnan SpA (\\\"the Angelic Grace\\\") [1995] 1 Lloyd's Rep 87 at 95.\\n\\n18 In early 2004 a representative of Smurfit made contact with Armacel in an email requesting information about Armacel's technology. At that time, Mr Frank Matich of Armacel was in discussion with a number of other American companies that were interested in licensing the technology.\\n\\n19 The background to Armacel's discussions with potential American licensees appears to be that in late 2003 it won an award from an American association as technology innovator of the year in the United States. Details were published in various magazines and journals, as a result of which Armacel received enquiries from countries in North and South America for the exploitation of the technology.\",\"3\":\"120 Second, Smurfit is in breach of the Agreement to attempt to mediate the dispute in Sydney. In my view, that was an agreement to embark upon a process of dispute resolution and is enforceable as such: Aiton Aust Pty Ltd v Transfield Pty Ltd (1999) 153 FCR 236 at [59]. I accept that the Agreement does not nominate a particular person to be the mediator, nor does it establish the machinery for the appointment of such a person. However, the better view in this case is that if the parties cannot agree the identity of a mediator, the Court can do so with the assistance of its powers under s 53A of the Federal Court Act 1976 (Cth) and O 72 of the Federal Court Rules : see Booker Industries Proprietary Limited v Wilson Parking (Qld) Proprietary Limited [1982] HCA 53 ; (1982) 149 CLR 600 at 614-615.\",\"4\":\"58 The first requirement draws attention to the need to identify with precision the issue which was necessarily decided in the earlier proceeding to see whether it is identical with an issue sought to be raised in the later proceeding: Blair v Curran (1939) 62 CLR 464 at 531; Makhoul v Barnes (1995) 60 FCR 572 at 579.\\n\\n59 The observations of Dixon J in Blair v Curran at 531 make it plain that the question which is the subject of the first requirement may be one of fact or law.\",\"5\":\"120 Second, Smurfit is in breach of the Agreement to attempt to mediate the dispute in Sydney.

Ultimately, Dr Bell conceded that this was so.\",\"8\":\"56 The High Court has adopted the formulation of Lord Guest in Carl Zeiss Stiftung v Rayner & Keeler Ltd (No 2) [1967] 1 AC 853 at 935, of three requirements for the creation of an issue estoppel: Kuligowski v Metrobus [2004] HCA 34 ; (2004) 220 CLR 363 at [21] . The requirements are: first, that the same question has been decided; second, that the decision was final; and third, that it was in proceedings between the same parties or their privies.\",\"9\":\"60 The second requirement may be satisfied even if the earlier judgment is interlocutory: Castillon v P&O Ports Ltd [2007] QCA 364 at [49] ff. The requirement of finality has been broken down into two separate conditions, namely that the decision must be \\\"final and conclusive\\\" and \\\"on the merits\\\": The Sennar (No 2) [1985] 1 WLR 490 (HL) at 499.\\n\\n62 This passage from Lord Brandon's speech was referred to with apparent approval in Schnabel v Lui [2002] NSWSC 15 at [112] ; Castillon v P&O Ports Ltd at [54]; and Prestige Property Services Pty Ltd v Madzoski [2008] WASCA 58 at [66] .\\n\\n63 The need for caution in the application of the doctrine of issue estoppel is well established, especially where the estoppel is said to arise from a judgment of a foreign court, and in an interlocutory context: The Sennar (HL) at 500; Castillon v P&O Ports at [55]; Desert Sun Loan Corp v Hill [1996] 2 All ER 847 at 858.\\n\\n65 The Sennar is also authority for that proposition as was accepted by Holmes JA in Castillon v P&O Ports at [54].\\n\\n66 Having approached the present matter with what, I hope, is the requisite degree of caution, I have come to the view that the present case is indistinguishable from The Sennar and that, accordingly, Armacel is barred by an issue estoppel from contending that cl 21.3.1 is an exclusive jurisdiction clause. In coming to this view, I have considered the decisions of the House of Lords, and the Court of Appeal in that case. The Court of Appeal decision is cited as \\\"The Sennar\\\" (No 2) [1984] 2 Lloyd's Rep 142.\\n\\n67 It seems to me that the reasons for judgment of Kerr LJ and Sir Denys Buckley (Cumming-Bruce LJ concurring) make it clear that it is not possible to avoid the consequence of issue estoppel by simply re-characterising the issue as one which is sought to be litigated in accordance with the law of a different jurisdiction.\\n\\n68 As Kerr LJ said at 149, it was not open to the plaintiffs to say, simply:\\n \\n What we seek to litigate here are issues under English law, and it does not matter that we litigated precisely the same issues under other systems of law in Holland.\\n\\n69 The facts of The Sennar are of some importance. The plaintiffs, who were the holders of a bill of lading, invoked the jurisdiction of a Dutch Court by arresting a sister ship of The Sennar in Rotterdam. They brought an action for damages in the Dutch Court which held that their only cause of action lay in contract and that the Dutch court was bound to decline jurisdiction because the contract contained a clause under which the parties submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Sudan.\\n\\n70 The plaintiffs then began an action in the Admiralty Court of England. However, although they succeeded on the jurisdictional question at first instance, the Court of Appeal held that they were barred from suing in the English Court by reason of an issue estoppel arising from the determination of the Dutch Court as to the construction and effect of the exclusive jurisdiction clause.\\n\\n71 Kerr LJ observed at 148 that the classification of the plaintiffs' claim, as a matter of private international law, fell to be decided by Sudanese law as the proper law of the bill of lading. He said at 149 that by applying Sudanese law, the Dutch Court of Appeal had adopted the correct approach under the English rules of private international law.\\n\\n72 However, as I have said, Kerr LJ at 149 also rejected the proposition that it was open to the plaintiffs to seek to re-litigate under English law the same issue that had been litigated under other systems of law in Holland.\\n\\n73 His Lordship observed at 150 that to accept this proposition would altogether remove the possibility of an issue estoppel arising \\\"from any decision by any Court\\\" on the jurisdiction clause. It would permit uncontrolled forum shopping and run directly counter to the policy behind the doctrine of issue estoppel.\",\"10\":\"46 The Court should not grant leave unless it is positively persuaded that it should do so: Voth at 564. However, the threshold is not high. The Court is not required to trawl through the material to determine the strength of the case. Rather, the Court's task is to determine whether the material presented shows that a controversy exists which warrants the use of the Court's processes in respect of litigation that brings a foreign respondent before an Australian court: Merpro Montassa Limited v Conoco Specialty Products Inc [1991] FCA 70 ; (1991) 28 FCR 387 at 390; State of Western Australia v Vetter Trittler Pty Ltd (In Liq) (1991) 30 FCR 102 at 109-110; Century Insurance Limited (In Prov Liq) v NZ Guardian Trust Limited (unreported, FCA, Lee J, 16 May 1996); Clough at [13]-[14].\",\"11\":\"97 Plainly, the fact that the United States proceedings were first in point of time is a relevant consideration. Moreover, for the reasons referred to by Lord Woolf in Messier Dowty at [34]-[42], I do not consider that I should approach the question with an adverse pre-disposition to the claim for negative declaratory relief: Challenger Group Holdings Ltd v Concept Equity Pty Ltd [2005] NSWSC 374 at [42] [43]. This issue in the US District Court is not hypothetical. Our courts should be slow to criticise the approach of the foreign court to the question of negative declaratory relief. It must be a matter of discretion in all the circumstances. Moreover, the US District Court has held that it does have jurisdiction and no point was raised in the Pennsylvania proceeding about negative declaratory relief.\",\"12\":\"44 The rehearing is conducted on the basis that the respondent should have the opportunity to put before the Court any additional material which may suggest that leave ought not to have been granted under O 8 r 3: Bray at [53]; Clough v Oil & Natural Gas Corporation Ltd [No 3] [2007] FCA 2082 at [12] .\\n\\n45 The onus remains on an applicant to satisfy the Court in light of the additional materials, facts and arguments that leave ought to have been granted: Voth at 564; Clough at [12].\\n\\n46 The Court should not grant leave unless it is positively persuaded that it should do so: Voth at 564.

The absence of the word \\\"exclusive\\\" is not determinative. Other language in the jurisdiction clause and the overall nature and effect of the contract are to be considered.\\n\\n88 However, cl 21.3.1 falls to be construed against the background that this was a contract made between business people negotiating at arms' length who must be presumed to have intended some certainty as to where their disputes would be litigated. The relevant courts, ie the courts of New South Wales or, subject to what I say below, the Federal Court, would have jurisdiction by reason of the choice of law clause. The parties agreed to mediate in Sydney. It is therefore difficult to see why they would not have intended that all their disputes be resolved in New South Wales: Sohio Supply Co v Gatoil (USA) Inc [1989] 1 Lloyd's Rep 588 at 591-592, cited in FAI at 121-122 and 127.\",\"17\":\"10 The effect of Smurfit's submission on the first issue is that, no prima facie case having been established under the Trade Practices Act , the claim for breach of contract does not fall within the accrued jurisdiction of the Court under the principles stated in Fencott v Muller [1983] HCA 12 ; (1983) 152 CLR 570 at 608-609.\\n\\n11 The second issue is whether the decision of the US District Court was final and conclusive and \\\"on the merits\\\", so as to give rise to an issue estoppel precluding Armacel from contending that cl 21.3.1 is an exclusive jurisdiction clause.\\n\\n12 The third issue is the proper construction of cl 21.3.1. That is to say, the question is whether that clause provides for the exclusive jurisdiction of New South Wales. Also falling within this issue is the subsidiary question of whether a submission to the jurisdiction of New South Wales is a submission to the jurisdiction of the New South Wales Registry of the Federal Court. Senior Counsel for Smurfit submits that it is not. This issue only arises if Armacel is not bound by an issue estoppel .\\n\\n50 Nor am I satisfied that the Trade Practices Act claims are \\\"trivial or insubstantial\\\" in their relationship to the overall controversy: Fencott v Muller at 609; Johnson Tiles Pty Ltd v Esso Australia Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1572 ; (2000) 104 FCR 564 at 597-599.\\n\\n93 Nevertheless, in certain circumstances the Federal Court picks up the laws of the States under s 79 of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) in the exercise of federal jurisdiction: John Robertson & Co Ltd v Ferguson Transformers Pty Ltd [1973] HCA 21 ; (1973) 129 CLR 65 at 95. Thus, a matter heard in the New South Wales Registry of the Federal Court would pick up the rules of State law, at least in those instances in which the laws of New South Wales apply generally eg to matters of procedure. The federal jurisdiction also includes accrued jurisdiction over non-federal matters as referred to in Fencott v Muller . In addition, the Federal Court has jurisdiction in associated matters under s 32 of the Federal Court Act .\",\"18\":\"2 Alternatively, Smurfit seeks a stay of this proceeding on the ground that the Federal Court is a clearly inappropriate forum in accordance with the principles stated by the High Court in Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Proprietary Limited [1990] HCA 55 ; (1990) 171 CLR 538 and Henry v Henry (1996) 185 CLR 571.\\n\\n13 The fourth issue, which only arises if I am satisfied that the jurisdiction of New South Wales is non-exclusive and that Armacel is not bound by an issue estoppel, is whether this Court is a clearly inappropriate forum, ie. whether this proceeding is vexatious or oppressive in the strict sense: Voth at 564-565; Henry v Henry at 587, 591-592.\\n\\n95 It is prima facie vexatious and oppressive to commence a proceeding in an Australian court if another action is already pending between the same parties, raising the same issues in another country. The existence of simultaneous proceedings with respect to the same controversy is a highly relevant consideration but it does not necessarily follow that there should be a stay of the Australian proceedings: Henry v Henry at 591-592; CSR v Cigna at 389ff .\\n\\n96 The test to be applied is whether having regard to the controversy as a whole, the Australian proceedings are vexatious or oppressive in the Voth sense: CSR v Cigna at 401. The considerations include which forum can provide more effectively for complete resolution of the matters in controversy, which proceeding was commenced first and the stage that each of the proceedings has reached: Henry v Henry at 592.\\n\\n123 The problems which arise if the same controversy is to be litigated in different countries which have jurisdiction with respect to the same matter are such that, prima facie , the continuation of one or other of them must be seen as vexatious or oppressive in the sense stated in Voth : see Henry v Henry at 591.\",\"19\":\"93 Nevertheless, in certain circumstances the Federal Court picks up the laws of the States under s 79 of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) in the exercise of federal jurisdiction: John Robertson & Co Ltd v Ferguson Transformers Pty Ltd [1973] HCA 21 ; (1973) 129 CLR 65 at 95.

Rather, the Court's task is to determine whether the material presented shows that a controversy exists which warrants the use of the Court's processes in respect of litigation that brings a foreign respondent before an Australian court: Merpro Montassa Limited v Conoco Specialty Products Inc [1991] FCA 70 ; (1991) 28 FCR 387 at 390; State of Western Australia v Vetter Trittler Pty Ltd (In Liq) (1991) 30 FCR 102 at 109-110; Century Insurance Limited (In Prov Liq) v NZ Guardian Trust Limited (unreported, FCA, Lee J, 16 May 1996); Clough at [13]-[14].\",\"26\":\"86 These principles reflect the ordinary rules of construction of contracts which are to be found in the observations of the High Court in Pacific Carriers Ltd v BNP Paribas [2004] HCA 35 ; (2004) 218 CLR 451 at [22] , as reaffirmed in Toll (FGCT) Pty Ltd v Alphapharm Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 52 ; (2004) 219 CLR 165 at [40] .\",\"27\":\"52 I accept that at a final hearing, reliance upon these representations may not be made out having regard to the \\\"entire agreement\\\" clause contained in cl 21.1 of the Agreement: Leda Holdings Pty Limited v Oraka Pty Limited (1997) ATPR 41-601 at [40,517] [40,518]; see also Poulet Frais Pty Ltd v The Silver Fox Company Pty Ltd [2005] FCAFC 131 ; [(2005) 220 ALR 211 at [75] - [76] , [81]; and see Equuscorp Pty Ltd v Glengallan Investments Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 55 ; (2004) 211 ALR 101 at [35] .\",\"28\":\"62 This passage from Lord Brandon's speech was referred to with apparent approval in Schnabel v Lui [2002] NSWSC 15 at [112] ; Castillon v P&O Ports Ltd at [54]; and Prestige Property Services Pty Ltd v Madzoski [2008] WASCA 58 at [66] .\",\"29\":\"110 The position seems to me to be unlike that which existed in Reinsurance Australia Corporation Ltd v HIH Casualty & General Insurance Ltd (in Liquidation) [2003] FCA 56. There, it was established on the evidence that the trade practices claims could not be maintained in the United States and that the remedies which would have been available in the English court were more restricted than those that were available under the Trade Practices Act : see at [217]-[218], [322].\\n\\n111 Accordingly, I am not satisfied that Armacel is deprived of a legitimate forensic disadvantage in being forced to bring its claim in the United States.\\n\\n112 There is some force in Dr Bell's submission that the dispute has a closer factual connection with the United States than it does with Australia. The principal issues in the contract claim appear to be the reasonableness of Smurfit's efforts to exploit the technology in the United States and whether it was entitled to disconnect Armacel's machine. The latter question may raise the application of United States environmental law issues including a complaint filed with the Occupational Health & Safety Administration: see Smurfit's Complaint in the US District Court [26].\",\"30\":\"62 This passage from Lord Brandon's speech was referred to with apparent approval in Schnabel v Lui [2002] NSWSC 15 at [112] ; Castillon v P&O Ports Ltd at [54]; and Prestige Property Services Pty Ltd v Madzoski [2008] WASCA 58 at [66] .\",\"31\":\"88 However, cl 21.3.1 falls to be construed against the background that this was a contract made between business people negotiating at arms' length who must be presumed to have intended some certainty as to where their disputes would be litigated. The relevant courts, ie the courts of New South Wales or, subject to what I say below, the Federal Court, would have jurisdiction by reason of the choice of law clause. The parties agreed to mediate in Sydney. It is therefore difficult to see why they would not have intended that all their disputes be resolved in New South Wales: Sohio Supply Co v Gatoil (USA) Inc [1989] 1 Lloyd's Rep 588 at 591-592, cited in FAI at 121-122 and 127.\",\"32\":\"46 The Court should not grant leave unless it is positively persuaded that it should do so: Voth at 564.
