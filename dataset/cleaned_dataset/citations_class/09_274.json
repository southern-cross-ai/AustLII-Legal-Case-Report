The outline must be sufficient to show that there is a genuine dispute about facts that are material to the outcome of the case. That will enable the judge to make some assessment of the merits . It would not, of course, be necessary, in most cases, to require the party to do more than provide an outline, because that would turn the summary judgment application into a trial. \\n\\n \\n [emphasis added]\\n\\nJustice Gordon in Jefferson Ford at [126] suggested that an assessment of whether a proceeding has no reasonable prospect of success requires an analysis of the pleadings, an assessment of the facts and, in part at least, a review of some of the evidence.\\n\\nIn the present proceeding, there has been no engagement by the respondents with the amended pleading. That partly arises because the respondents contend that the amended pleading fails to plead material facts which establish, if proved, a cause of action based on accessorial liability on the part of Mr Sasse. Therefore, there can be no relevant engagement or an assessment in terms of the methodology contemplated by either Gordon J or Finkelstein J. Moreover, there can be no proper assessment of whether there is a genuine dispute as to factual matters as the material threshold facts have not been pleaded.\\n\\nThe applicants say that the pleading properly asserts material facts from which, if proved, accessorial liability in Mr Sasse can be established. Nevertheless, the applicants say that the application by the respondents is premature and, in any event, the application should be treated as an application going to the adequacy of the amended pleading. If the Court is not satisfied that the amended pleading properly frames material facts establishing a cause of action in accessorial liability, the relevant paragraphs of the pleading ought to be dismissed and the applicants ought to be given leave to re-plead the claims.\\n\\nThe first question then is whether the amended pleading properly frames a cause of action in accessorial liability on the part of Mr Sasse.

It is not said that the conduct of Mr Sasse gave rise to a contravention by John Holland. The pleading asserts that Mr Sasse aided, abetted, counselled and procured the contravention of the sections by John Holland. In order to establish that case, the pleading must assert as material facts that Mr Sasse was sufficiently aware of all of the relevant facts going to the contravention by the company, that is, intentional participation. In this case, it must be established that Mr Sasse had knowledge that the permit holders enjoyed a right of entry and notwithstanding that knowledge, he set about engaging in the contravening conduct.
