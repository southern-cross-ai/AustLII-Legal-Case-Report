Peoplebank points to the fact that the notice of motion was filed some time after the service of the order and after the acknowledgment of liability to pay those costs, as referred to above. As Peoplebank points out, at no time have any objections to the amount sought been notified or formulated. If it had a genuine concern as to the quantification of costs, Cytel had every opportunity to bring an application to set aside the certificate of taxation of which it acknowledged receipt. Cytel did not do so. Peoplebank has been forced to incur unnecessary costs in respect of an obligation to pay costs previously acknowledged. The attempt to avoid that payment and to extend the litigation is without merit and the burden of the solicitor-client costs of the motion should not be borne by Peoplebank ( Yang v American International Assurance Company (Australia) Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 493).\\n\\n32 It is appropriate that Cytel pay Peoplebank's costs of the notice of motion on an indemnity basis.\\n\\n I certify that the preceding thirty-two (32) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Bennett. \\n\\n Associate:\\n\\nDated: 21 April 2008\\n\\n Counsel for the Applicant: B DeBuse \\n \\n Solicitor for the Applicant: Marsdens Law Group \\n \\n Counsel for the Respondent: P R Garling SC, G Lucarelli \\n \\n Solicitor for the Respondent: Thomson Playford \\n\\n Date of Hearing: 9 April 2008 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 22 April 2008 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2008\\/518.html\"}}"
