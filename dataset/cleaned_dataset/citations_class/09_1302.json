In any event, however, it is clear that the Tribunal had provided the appellant with an adequate opportunity to present argument and give oral evidence in that, inter alia :\\n\\nThe appellant failed to appear before the Tribunal at the hearing scheduled on 19 February 2008, and the Tribunal was entitled to make a decision without taking any further action to allow or enable the appellant to appear before it: s 426A.

This deprived the Applicant of a fair opportunity to respond.\\n 2. The Tribunal fell into jurisdictional error in that it failed to disclose adverse findings.\\n Particulars\\n The Tribunal failed to disclose to the Applicant, clear particulars of any information that the Tribunal considers would be the reason, or a part of the reason for affirming the decision under review and ensure that the Applicant fully understands the significance of the review and the consequences of it being relied on in affirming the decision that is under review.\\n 3. The Tribunal fell into jurisdictional error in that it failed to provide adequate opportunity to present arguments and give oral evidence.\\n Particulars\\n The Tribunal had failed to provide the Applicant with an adequate opportunity to respond to the lack of evidence and present his arguments because the Tribunal was \\\"unable to make a favourable decision based on the given materials alone\\\". The letter was itself not in a language understandable by the Applicant which resulted in the Applicant being unable to respond fully and appropriately. As a result, the Applicant was unaware of the nature of the hearing and the consequences it bears on the effect of the decision to refuse his visa thus being deprived of the opportunity to arrive at that understanding to give oral evidence and present his arguments.\\n\\nBefore me both the appellant and the Minister were represented by counsel.\",\"3\":\"Part 7 Division 4 of the Act provides a comprehensive procedural code in respect of the requirements of procedural fairness that must be accorded to review applicants in the conduct of reviews under that Division to the exclusion of the common law natural justice hearing rule: s 422B , SZMKG v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCAFC 99 at [49] - [50] .
