"{\"id\":{\"0\":\"c0\"},\"class\":{\"0\":\"applied\"},\"tocase\":{\"0\":\"Adam P. Brown Male Fashions Pty Ltd v Phillip Morris Inc (1981) 148 CLR 170\"},\"text\":{\"0\":\"3 It is common ground that in ruling upon this application, the Court is to apply the test established by the High Court in Adam P. Brown Male Fashions Pty Ltd v Phillip Morris Inc (1981) 148 CLR 170 which requires the respondent to persuade the Court that the discharge of the undertaking would be appropriate because of the existence of new facts that render the ongoing enforcement of the undertaking unjust.\\n\\n4 The respondent carries the burden of establishing the new facts. Mr McDonald of Senior Counsel, who appeared on behalf of the respondent with Mr O'Grady, argued that there were two material changes in circumstances which rendered it unjust for the Court to maintain the undertaking of the respondent.\\n\\n5 First, Mr McDonald contended that the cause of action under s 1317AA of the Act had been abandoned by the legal representative of the applicant in the course of the trial, which is presently part heard. Reference was made to the transcript at pp 22 and 50 which support the contention that this cause of action was abandoned in the course of the trial.\"}}"
