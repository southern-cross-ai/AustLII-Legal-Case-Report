In reversing the trial Judge's decision, the Full Court considered the scope of the concept of natural justice in relation to such a hearing and said at 590:\\n \\n It is a fundamental principle that where the rules of procedural fairness apply to a decision-making process, the party liable to be directly affected by the decision is to be given the opportunity of being heard. That would ordinarily require the party affected to be given the opportunity of ascertaining the relevant issues and to be informed of the nature and content of adverse material: Dixon v Commonwealth (1981) 61 ALR 173 at 179. However, as Lord Diplock said in F Hoffman-La Roche and Co. A.G. v Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (1975) AC 295 at 369: \\n \\n \\n \\\"... the rules of natural justice do not require the decision maker to disclose what he is minded to decide so that the parties may have a further opportunity of criticising his mental processes before he reaches a final decision.
