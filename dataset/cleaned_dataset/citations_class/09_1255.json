As elaborated, the concept of deterrence is to deter repetition by the contravener and by others who might be tempted to contravene the Act ( TPC v CSR at 52,125 per French J), or to deter others who might be tempted to think that contravention would be of benefit and detection would lead merely to a compliance program for the future ( NW Frozen Foods at 294 295 per Burchett and Kiefel JJ). The need to achieve general deterrence as well as specific deterrence means that a party's capacity to pay must be weighed against the need to impose a sum which members of the public will recognise as significant and proportionate to the seriousness of the contravention ( Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Leahy Petroleum Pty Ltd (No 3) [2005] FCA 265 ; (2005) 215 ALR 301 at [39] per Goldberg J).\",\"2\":\"I note also that, as French J said in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Real Estate Institute of Western Australia Inc [1999] FCA 18 ; (1999) 161 ALR 79 at [18] , it is not sufficient, in making a consent order, that it is within the power of the Court to make the order nor that the parties have privately agreed as to the proposed order. The Court is not merely giving effect to the wishes of the parties. It is exercising a public function and must have regard to the public interest in doing so.\\n\\nAs to the specific matters relevant in the present case, the parties have made submissions on: the nature and extent of the contravening conduct; the amount of loss or damage caused; the circumstances in which the conduct took place; similar conduct in the past whether the contravener has previously been found by the Court to have engaged in similar conduct; the size of the contravening company; the degree of power the contravening company has, as evidenced by its market share and ease of entry into the market; the deliberateness of the contravention and the period over which it extended; whether the contravention arose out of conduct of senior management or at a lower level; whether the company has a corporate culture conducive to compliance with the Code, as evidenced by compliance programs and corrective measures in response to an acknowledged contravention; whether the company has shown a disposition to co-operate with the authorities responsible for the enforcement of the Code in relation to the contravention; the financial position of the respondents; the deterrent effect of the proposed penalty; and totality and parity. Application of the principles\\n The nature and extent of the contravening conduct\\n\\nThe Understanding was reached at the AGM of the AKA, a sporting association whose members are kart racing associations based in NSW and the ACT. Mr Erdmann and Mr Whiting participated in a discussion amongst the representatives of the AKA clubs in attendance at the AGM, that discussion leading to the motion being proposed. The members voted and passed the Resolution which gave rise to the understanding.\\n\\nThe understanding was given effect to on three occasions when Prokart received quotes from the AKA regarding the hire of kart circuits on which to hold its race series.\\n\\nThe conduct ceased once the AKA became aware of the ACCC investigation and the possible contravention of the Code, which was less than three months after the Resolution was passed. The Resolution was subsequently revoked. The amount of loss or damage caused\",\"3\":\"Although the present proceedings concern contraventions of the Code only, the Court has jurisdiction under s 39B(1A)(a) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) which confers original jurisdiction on the Federal Court in proceedings where the Commonwealth seeks an injunction or declaration (similarly to Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v White Top Taxis Ltd [2009] FCA 88 ; (2009) 253 ALR 449). The principles for assessing penalty under the Code are the same as under the TPA ( White Top Taxis at [20] per Finkelstein J).\",\"4\":\"The AKA, Wagga Kart Club, Newcastle Kart Club and Manning Valley Kart Club admit that they made an arrangement or arrived at an understanding in contravention of s 45(2)(a)(i) and (ii) of the Code ( Hughes v Western Australian Cricket Association (Inc) (1986) 19 FCR 10). The AKA, Dubbo Kart Club, Newcastle Kart Club and Manning Valley Kart Club admit that they gave effect to an arrangement or understanding which contained a provision which: \\n(a) was an exclusionary provision; and\\n \\n(b) had the purpose and was likely to have the effect of substantially lessening competition;\\nin contravention of s 45(2)(b)(i) and 45 (2)(b)(ii) of the Code, by the conduct outlined above.\\n\\nEach of Mr Erdmann and Mr Whiting admits that they were knowingly concerned in, or a party to, the making of or the arriving at the Understanding which was in contravention of s 45(2)(a)(i) and 45 (2)(a)(ii) of the Code.\\n\\nI am satisfied that in each case those contraventions have been made out.

The parties in the joint submissions referred to further relevant factors addressed by French J in Trade Practices Commission v CSR Ltd (1991) ATPR 41-076 at 52,152-52,153 and expanded upon in NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [1996] FCA 1134 ; (1996) 71 FCR 285 and J McPhee & Son (Australia) Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2000] FCA 365 ; (2000) 172 ALR 532. It is uncontroversial as between the parties that the total penalty for related offences ought not to exceed what is proper for the entire contravening conduct involved ( Mornington Inn v Jordan [2008] FCAFC 70 ; (2008) 168 FCR 383 at [42] - [45] , [91] per Stone and Buchanan JJ).\",\"7\":\"Bearing in mind the process as set out by the High Court in Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25 ; (2005) 228 CLR 357 for the assessment of criminal sanctions where penalties are not fixed by statute, the ACCC and the AKA jointly submit that a total pecuniary penalty of $10,000 imposed on the AKA is appropriate and within the range of penalties that a Court would order in these circumstances. The parties point out that in considering the proposed agreed penalty, the Court should take into account the fact that a negotiated resolution may be expected to include measures designed to promote, for the future, vigorous competition in the particular market. The imposition of penalty is a matter for the Court ( NW Frozen Foods at 290) and the assessment of the appropriate penalty involves exercising a discretion taking into account all relevant factors ( Markarian at [27]). However, the parties submit that the Court should not depart from an agreed figure merely because it might otherwise have been disposed to select some other figure except in a clear case ( NW Frozen Foods at 291, approved and explained in Minister for Industry, Tourism & Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd [2004] FCAFC 72 ; (2004) ATPR 41-993).\",\"8\":\"Bearing in mind the process as set out by the High Court in Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25 ; (2005) 228 CLR 357 for the assessment of criminal sanctions where penalties are not fixed by statute, the ACCC and the AKA jointly submit that a total pecuniary penalty of $10,000 imposed on the AKA is appropriate and within the range of penalties that a Court would order in these circumstances.

I am mindful of the fact that the AKA has agreed to pay a contribution to the ACCC's costs of the proceedings in an amount to be agreed. I am conscious of the fact that this is a voluntary organisation conducting kart racing in the interests of an interested section of the public. I have taken into account the various factors elucidated in Mobil Oil regarding the public interest in the settlement of litigation.

It is uncontroversial as between the parties that the total penalty for related offences ought not to exceed what is proper for the entire contravening conduct involved ( Mornington Inn v Jordan [2008] FCAFC 70 ; (2008) 168 FCR 383 at [42] - [45] , [91] per Stone and Buchanan JJ).\",\"13\":\"Each of the respondents has consented to the imposition of injunctions. The injunctions are available pursuant to s 80 of the Code and are in the nature of public interest injunctions ( ICI Australia Operations Pty Limited v Trade Practices Commission [1992] FCA 474 ; (1992) 38 FCR 248 at 255 to 256 per Lockhart J; Truth About Motorways Pty Limited v Macquarie Infrastructure Investment Management Limited (2000) 200 CLR 591 at 602 per Gleeson CJ and McHugh J).\"}}"
