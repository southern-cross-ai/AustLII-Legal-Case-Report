One means adopted to achieve this objective is the regime in Pt 9 of the Act for supervision of the transfer or amalgamation of life insurance businesses by the Court (s 3(2)(f) ; Re Royal & Sun Alliance Life Assurance Ltd [2000] FCA 1259 ; (2000) 104 FCR 37 at [3] ).\\n\\nIn exercising its supervisory jurisdiction under Pt 9 of the Act, the Court has a discretion to refuse a scheme or confirm it with or without modification (s 194).
