The Tribunal had affirmed a decision of a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship to refuse to grant a protection visa to the appellant.\\n\\nThe appellant is a citizen of Sri Lanka. The appellant entered Australia on 3 February 1999 on a Student visa. On 12 August 2002 he lodged an application for a protection visa with the (now) Department of Immigration and Citizenship.\\n\\nThe appellant claimed that he had a well-founded fear of persecution on the basis of his political opinion due to his involvement with the People's Alliance (\\\"PA\\\"). The appellant claimed that he supported a PA candidate (\\\"the candidate\\\"), organised the local youth wing of the PA, and attended protests against the United National Party (\\\"UNP\\\"). He claimed that, as a result of his involvement, he was subjected to a number of incidents of persecution from supporters of the UNP. He claimed that he was assaulted by a mob when attending an anti-UNP protest in 1994 and that people later came with weapons to his aunt's house where he was living in hiding and inquired about him. He further claimed that, in June 1994, he was assaulted by a gang, which resulted in him sustaining an injury to his arm and requiring treatment in hospital. He said that the candidate he supported advised him to leave the country because he was being targeted by the UNP.\",\"5\":\"In my view his Honour was correct.

There is no apparent error in the Tribunal's reliance on this report.\\n\\nThe fourth ground is not made out.
