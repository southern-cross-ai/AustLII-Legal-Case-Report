That is to say, the Court does not embark upon a hypothetical trial to determine what the result of the application would have been.

His Honour referred to earlier authority which recognised the need for a relation between the order for production of documents and the purposes of examining persons under the then s 597. His Honour also observed at page 763 that \\\"[an] order for production of documents which had the effect of compelling a production of documents which were not required for the examination would [...] be oppressive\\\".\\n\\n12 At page 766, his Honour remarked that it would not be appropriate in the case of a mandatory order directed to a person to perform stated acts that the validity of the order should be saved by some process of severance. He pointed out that it is unlikely the judicial officer who made the order would have intended that some severable part of the order would be valid if other parts of it were not valid. Thus, the contemplation must be that the whole of the order would stand in view of the consequences of failure to comply with such an order.\\n\\n13 It does seem to me that in light of the observations of Bryson J in Re BPTC there is some force in Mr Thawley's submission that the category of documents sought by [4] was so broad that it could not have been necessary for the proper conduct of the proposed examination of the affairs of Allstate.\\n\\n14 Mr Thawley conceded that [4] included documents relevant to the examinable affairs of Allstate but he submitted that its terms were not confined to relevant documents. I do not accept that the terms of the order were so broad that they extended beyond the examinable affairs of Allstate. Mr Thawley's concession must clearly be correct, particularly in light of the fact that Mr Thawley has not had access to the confidential affidavit which gave rise to the orders of the Registrar made on 1 September 2006.\\n\\n15 Mr Lee, for the applicants, submitted that it is plain from the exchange of correspondence and the concession made on 15 September to which I have referred, that the applicants were prepared to limit the scope of production in a sensible manner. Whilst I think that is correct, nonetheless, it seems to me that in the absence of any actual agreement between the parties to limit the scope of [4] by the deadline of 22 September, Mr Trevor and BankWest had to file their applications on that day.\\n\\n18 In my view, it is plain that Mr Trevor and BankWest needed to obtain an order in terms of [1] of their interlocutory applications. This is because, without access to the confidential affidavit, it would have been difficult, if not impossible, for them to properly address the Court on the question of whether the production order infringed the principles referred to by Bryson J in Re BPTC .\\n\\n19 Thus, whether or not an order for access to the confidential affidavit was the primary relief that was sought, it was an essential part of each of the applications and without determining that issue, I cannot determine what the result would have been. It may well be that the result would have been adverse to Mr Thawley's clients.\",\"2\":\"22 Different considerations seem to me to apply to an application to set aside an examination summons. In Re Struthers, Liquidator of Project Management, Architecture and Construction, Interior (PACI) Pty Ltd in Liquidation (No. 3) [2005] NSWSC 1113 ; (2005) 64 NSWLR 392 at [38] , Brereton J pointed out that an examination summons in analogous to a subpoena; \\\"Both may, in appropriate circumstances, be set aside on the application of the witness or the examinee\\\". The witness or the examinee does not become a party to the proceedings in which the subpoena or the summons is issued. Nonetheless, as his Honour observed at [59], the Court does have power to make a costs order against persons who are not parties to the proceedings.\",\"3\":\"17 It seems to me, therefore, that the principles which were stated by McHugh J in Re The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs of the Commonwealth; Ex parte Lai Qin [1997] HCA 6 ; (1997) 186 CLR 622 at 624-625 apply. That is to say, the Court does not embark upon a hypothetical trial to determine what the result of the application would have been. Whilst it is true that in certain circumstances the Court can make an order for costs where proceedings have not proceeded to trial, the usual rule will be that there be no order as to costs; see also Chapman v Luminis Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 162 at [7] .\\n\\n23 For the reasons that I have given, it seems to me that it is appropriate that the application for the costs of Mr Trevor and BankWest be refused consistent with the principles stated by McHugh J in Ex parte Lai Qin , and applied by the Full Court.\\n\\n24 The appropriate order seems to me to be that there be no order as to costs and I would indicate that I would make the same order in relation to today's application.\\n\\n I certify that the preceding twenty-four (24) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Jacobson. \\n\\n\\n Associate: \\n\\nDated: 5 April 2007\\n\\n\\n Counsel for the Applicant: Mr MBJ Lee \\n \\n Solicitor for the Applicant: Piper Alderman \\n \\n Counsel for the Respondent: Mr TM Thawley \\n \\n Solicitor for the Respondent: Henry Davis York \\n \\n Date of Hearing: 5 April 2007 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 5 April 2007 \\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2007\\/506.html\",\"4\":\"20 The background to these proceedings may be seen in the decision of Gyles J in Ryan v Australian Securities and Investments Commission; in the matter of Allstate Explorations NL (Subject to Deed of Company Arrangement) [2007] FCA 59. It is to be noted that ASIC approved the applicants as persons who could seek examination orders. Nevertheless, in view of what I have said above, these are not matters which I need to consider in determining the costs question.\"}}"
