The debit card would be loaded each week with a nominated amount for purchases. The promise held out was that over a given period participants could receive an effective discount of 50 per cent. For example, for a Plan Fee of $250 the participant was promised $25 worth of fuel per week for 20 weeks.\\n\\n8 The FUELbanc scheme also involves debit cards issued for the purchase of fuel. Its distinguishing feature, however, is the use of a barter system known as \\\"E Banc\\\" in which goods and services are exchanged for barter units known as \\\"trade dollars\\\" as well as ordinary Australian currency.

It is appropriate to make the declarations sought. It is sometimes said that a declaration is an appropriate way of marking the Court's disapproval of the contravening conduct: see eg McDougall at [55]. While certainly the conduct of the corporate defendants and Stephen McDougall has been reprehensible, the actual declarations do no more than declare the bare facts that the defendants operated an unregistered managed investment scheme and carried on a financial services business without a licence. The declarations would be equally appropriate if the defendants' business had been carried on with exemplary prudence and meticulous bookkeeping. A more satisfactory rationale may be that the right declared will be a public right. In Tobacco Institute (at 98) Sheppard J said that the declaration in that case would\\n \\n \\\" ... be a declaration of right because the right which will be declared will be a public right, namely, the right of the public not to be misled or deceived by factual statements in an advertisement concerning the effects of passive smoking.\\\" \\n\\n\\nIn the present case the legislation contravened protects public rights by regulating the conduct of those who seek investment from the public. Declarations as to the contraventions provide a formal vindication of the law's operation.\",\"1\":\"32 The \\\"body corporate\\\" exception (see [25] above) does not apply. The purpose of this exception is to ensure that the ordinary engagement of a company in commercial activities does not come within the managed investment scheme regime. The contract created by a company's constitution (see now Corporations Act s 140(1)) only affords rights or imposes obligations on a member in his or her capacity as a member: Hickman v Kent or Romney Marsh Sheep Breeders' Association [1915] 1 Ch 881 at 897. The essence of the FUELbanc scheme is that a participant provides \\\"trade dollars\\\" and cash in return for a promise to provide credit for the purchase of fuel over a future period. The legal foundation for this arrangement is not membership of the company but the contractual relationship between the company and the participant. Relevantly for present purposes, the participant becomes a member of the scheme whether or not he or she becomes a member of the company. (In any event, ASIC has been unable to discover any membership registers, minutes or other records which might prove that participants in fact became members.)\\n\\n33 Section 763B of the Corporations Act provides:\\n \\n \\\"For the purposes of this Chapter [ie Chapter 7 Financial Services and Markets], a person (the investor) makes a financial investment if: \\n \\n \\n \\n (a) the investor gives money or money's worth (the contribution) to another person and any of the following apply: \\n \\n \\n \\n (i) the other person uses the contribution to generate a financial return, or other benefit, for the investor; \\n (ii) the investor intends that the other person will use the contribution to generate a financial return, or other benefit, for the investor (even if no return or benefit is in fact generated); \\n (iii) the other person intends that the contribution will be used to generate a financial return, or other benefit, for the investor (even if no return or benefit is in fact generated); and \\n \\n \\n \\n (b) the investor has no day-to-day control over the use of the contribution to generate the return or benefit.\\\"\\n\\n34 Participants in the FUELbanc scheme are making a \\\"financial investment\\\" within the meaning of s 763B because they give money to FUELbanc which uses the contribution to generate a financial return or other benefit for the participant. The participant intends that FUELbanc will use the contribution to generate a financial return or other benefit for him or her and FUELbanc intends that the contribution will be used to generate a financial return or other benefit for the participants. In all these respects the contribution is caught even if no return or benefit is in fact generated.\",\"2\":\"42 In respect of the FUELbanc unregistered managed investment scheme, was Stephen McDougall a person \\\"operat(ing)\\\" the scheme within the meaning of s 601EE? As Davies AJ said in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Pegasus Leveraged Options Group Pty Ltd (2002) 41 ACSR 561 at [55]:\\n \\n \\\"The term [operate] is not used to refer to ownership or proprietorship but rather to the acts which constitute the management of or the carrying out of the activities which constitute the managed investment scheme.\\\"\\n\\n60 A number of courts have made declarations in cases involving contraventions which carried criminal penalties, albeit with no express discussion of the point raised in Intertax .

He was thus one of those operating the scheme.\\n\\n45 As to Stephen McDougall's liability for carrying on a financial services business without a licence, the same reasoning applies. In any event he would clearly have aided, abetted, counselled and procured FUELbanc to contravene the Act: s 1324(1)(c).\",\"4\":\"47 Although, as I have already noted, the orders sought by ASIC were not opposed, Mr Scott very properly drew my attention to the decision of Fryberg J of the Supreme Court of Queensland in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Intertax Holdings [2006] QSC 276 , a case which also concerned an unregistered managed investment scheme. His Honour declined to make a declaration against two individuals involved on the ground that the possibility of a prosecution was open and ASIC had refused to give any undertaking that prosecution would not follow. His Honour said (at [4]):\\n \\n \\\"Where the possibility of the prosecution is open, it would, in my judgment, be contrary to the ordinary practice for the authority of this Court to be given to a declaration which, in substance, amounted to a declaration that the defendant had committed a crime. One should not make a declaration which might be falsified by a subsequent acquittal in proceedings between the same parties.\\\" \\n \\n\\nIn the present case ASIC does not rule out the possibility of future criminal proceedings against the defendants.\\n\\n51 While courts are still reluctant to grant declaratory relief on issues which are theoretical or hypothetical (see Zamir and Woolf, op cit, 117 et seq), the Intertax argument against the grant of declaratory relief is based on a hypothetical fact, indeed a hypothesis upon a hypothesis that there will be a prosecution and that such prosecution will result in an acquittal.\\n\\n55 In Intertax Fryberg J (at [8]) distinguished Australian Softwood on the ground that the High Court's approval \\n \\n \\\"... was to the proposition that a declaration could be granted notwithstanding that an injunction would not be granted.\\\" \\n \\n\\nIf by this his Honour meant that the High Court only granted a declaration because, with the consent of the parties, they did not grant an injunction, then I do not agree. Gibbs CJ said (at 125):\\n \\n \\\"With all respect, Hutley JA was not correct in saying that declarations 'are little more than prefatory averments to the grant of an injunction'. In my opinion it was proper to grant a declaration in the present case although it is now agreed that an injunction is not an appropriate remedy.\\\" \\n \\n\\nIn any case, if it were only appropriate to make declarations where injunctions were not granted, that would not get over the supposed problem of possible \\\"falsification\\\" by subsequent acquittal in criminal proceedings.\\n\\n60 A number of courts have made declarations in cases involving contraventions which carried criminal penalties, albeit with no express discussion of the point raised in Intertax .

In Sankey v Whitlam [1978] HCA 43 ; (1978) 142 CLR 1 the High Court, in respect of then current committal proceedings (ie actual, not hypothetical, criminal proceedings) made declarations that (i) certain documents were privileged from production and that (ii) the information laid against Mr Whitlam was bad in law. Gibbs ACJ said at 20-21:\\n \\n \\\"It is well established that the power of the court to make a declaration, under a provision such as s 75 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (N.S.W.), as amended, or O. 26, r. 19 of the Rules of this Court, is a very wide one: Forster v. Jododex Aust. Pty. Ltd . [1972] HCA 61 ; (1972) 127 CLR 421, at pp 435-436 . It is clear enough that the power of the court is not excluded because the matter as to which a declaration is sought may fall for decision in criminal proceedings. Indeed in Dyson v. Attorney-General [1911] 1 KB 410, which is one of the foundations of the law on this subject, it was held that the court had power to make a declaration that the plaintiff was not under any obligation to comply with the requisitions contained in a notice sent to him by the Commissioners of Inland Revenue, notwithstanding that neglect to comply with the notice was an offence see especially per Farwell L.J. [1911]1 KB, at p 422. Since that time there have been many cases in which the courts have made declarations in relation to questions which could have fallen for decision in criminal proceedings.\\\"\\n\\n57 His Honour observed (at 603) that while ordinarily a declaration is not made that a defendant has committed a crime, there was no doubt that there was jurisdiction to make such a declaration in a proper case: Imperial Tobacco Limited v Attorney-General [1981] AC 718 at 750, Sankey v Whitlam . Thus it was appropriate in many cases for a business person who is told by a regulatory authority that he or she cannot do something to apply for a declaration that the view is erroneous. Conversely, the right was mutual; the Crown could also obtain a declaration that the person's conduct contravened the law. That practice, which was common in New South Wales, had been given the \\\"seal of approval\\\" by the High Court in Australian Softwood .\",\"9\":\"53 Of direct application to the present case is Australian Softwood Forest Pty Ltd v Attorney-General (NSW) [1981] HCA 49 ; (1981) 148 CLR 121. The case concerned a pine plantation investment scheme which the Corporate Affairs Commission (NSW) alleged involved the issuing or offering of an \\\"interest\\\" contrary to s 76(1) of the Companies Act 1961 (NSW). The trial judge made a declaration to the effect alleged and granted injunctions. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal but said that it was not a proper case for the grant of declarations, which were \\\"little more than prefatory averments to the grant of an injunction\\\". The High Court dismissed the substantive appeal. The parties accepted that an injunction was no longer necessary since the conduct in question was not continuing. The High Court nevertheless granted a declaration substantially to the effect of that granted by the trial judge.\\n\\n54 The contraventions the subject of the declaration in Australian Softwood carried criminal penalties: Companies Act, s 86(1). Murphy J thought this was a positive reason for the grant of a declaration. Certainly his Honour saw the possibility, indeed desirability, of criminal proceedings as no reason for refusing a declaration. His Honour commenced his judgment as follows at (136):\\n \\n \\\"One of the most widespread and successful of the species of fraud known in Australia and elsewhere as 'the investment racket' is the forest or plantation variety.\\\" \\n\\n \\nLater (at 137) his Honour said that the appellant\\n \\n \\\" ... has already procured signatures and acceptances from more than 4000 persons. This represents more than $200,000 in deposits and promises to pay instalments of well over a million dollars. Presumably all those who have been party to offences against the Companies Act in relation to the issues are liable to criminal proceedings, at least with the consent of the Minister (see s 381). In these circumstances, and because the respondent did not press in this Court for the injunction, I agree the relief should be confined to appropriate declarations.\\\"\\n\\n55 In Intertax Fryberg J (at [8]) distinguished Australian Softwood on the ground that the High Court's approval \\n \\n \\\"... was to the proposition that a declaration could be granted notwithstanding that an injunction would not be granted.\\\" \\n \\n\\nIf by this his Honour meant that the High Court only granted a declaration because, with the consent of the parties, they did not grant an injunction, then I do not agree.

Transphere is to an extent comparable in that the defendant in that case appeared and did not oppose the declaration. However, he we not legally represented. Young J (at 605-608) extensively reviewed the case law. His Honour (at 608) accepted the submission that the law as to declaratory judgments had developed to such a stage that declaration should be made unless there are proper grounds to the contrary, subject to the proviso that a \\\"legitimate and powerful\\\" factor against the grant would be the possibility of embarrassment in a practical sense to a non-party. As has been noted ([58] above) his Honour found that in the circumstances of the case before him such embarrassment did exist and on that ground declined a declaration.\\n\\n68 In the present case, there being no suggestion of any embarrassment to non-parties in the present case, I will follow the principle accepted by Young J in Transphere .\\n\\n69 I will make the declarations referred to above ([46]), and the following orders:\\n \\n 1.

Thus it was appropriate in many cases for a business person who is told by a regulatory authority that he or she cannot do something to apply for a declaration that the view is erroneous. Conversely, the right was mutual; the Crown could also obtain a declaration that the person's conduct contravened the law. That practice, which was common in New South Wales, had been given the \\\"seal of approval\\\" by the High Court in Australian Softwood .\",\"12\":\"60 A number of courts have made declarations in cases involving contraventions which carried criminal penalties, albeit with no express discussion of the point raised in Intertax .

First, declarations will not usually be made when the only material before the Court is the consent of the parties: BMI Limited v Federated Clerks Union of Australia (1983) 51 ALR 401 at 412. As will have been apparent, in the present case ASIC has presented evidence and submissions.\\n\\n65 One of the authorities discussed by Young J was BMI . In that case Keely and Beaumont JJ (at 413), after referring to what was said by Buckley LJ and Scarman J in Wallersteiner v Moir [1974] 1 WLR 991 at 1029 and 1030 respectively, said:\\n \\n \\\" ... we think that it is generally undesirable that the court should grant relief by way of declaratory orders under s 108 [of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904 (Cth)] in the absence of any contest on the question.\\\" \\n\\n\\nTheir Honours acknowledged (at 414) that, if it were demonstrated in a particular case that it were necessary that the question be resolved judicially, it may be appropriate for the court to appoint an amicus curiae to put the contrary view, if any, on the facts and on the questions of law which arise.\\n\\n66 In BMI not only was there no contradictor, but the particular question that was the subject of the proposed declaration had become academic. Moreover, there were a number of contrary arguments on the merits; see 414-415. The Full Court did not propound any binding proposition of law, still less one which would bind single judges deciding cases under investor protection provisions of corporations legislation.\\n\\n67 The suggestion of retaining counsel to put a contrary argument as amicus curiae raises the practical question as to who should foot the bill. Certainly it would be unreasonable to impose on the generosity of counsel who have volunteered for pro bono schemes. It is no function of the Court itself to expend money on filling a supposed gap in the range of arguments presented to it by the parties. And ASIC has limited public funds to spend on its important law enforcement functions.\",\"20\":\"63 Secondly, it is said there must be \\\"a proper contradictor, that is to say, some one presently existing who has a true interest to oppose the declaration sought\\\": Russian Commercial & Industrial Bank v British Bank for Foreign Trade Ltd [1921] 2 AC 438 at 448, Forster v Jododex Australia Pty Limited [1972] HCA 61 ; (1972) 127 CLR 421 at 437, Transphere at 605.\",\"21\":\"52 There is high authority against the supposed limitation on the exercise of the discretionary power to grant declaratory relief. In Sankey v Whitlam [1978] HCA 43 ; (1978) 142 CLR 1 the High Court, in respect of then current committal proceedings (ie actual, not hypothetical, criminal proceedings) made declarations that (i) certain documents were privileged from production and that (ii) the information laid against Mr Whitlam was bad in law. Gibbs ACJ said at 20-21:\\n \\n \\\"It is well established that the power of the court to make a declaration, under a provision such as s 75 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (N.S.W.), as amended, or O. 26, r. 19 of the Rules of this Court, is a very wide one: Forster v. Jododex Aust. Pty. Ltd . [1972] HCA 61 ; (1972) 127 CLR 421, at pp 435-436 . It is clear enough that the power of the court is not excluded because the matter as to which a declaration is sought may fall for decision in criminal proceedings. Indeed in Dyson v. Attorney-General [1911] 1 KB 410, which is one of the foundations of the law on this subject, it was held that the court had power to make a declaration that the plaintiff was not under any obligation to comply with the requisitions contained in a notice sent to him by the Commissioners of Inland Revenue, notwithstanding that neglect to comply with the notice was an offence see especially per Farwell L.J. [1911]1 KB, at p 422. Since that time there have been many cases in which the courts have made declarations in relation to questions which could have fallen for decision in criminal proceedings.\\\"\\n\\n63 Secondly, it is said there must be \\\"a proper contradictor, that is to say, some one presently existing who has a true interest to oppose the declaration sought\\\": Russian Commercial & Industrial Bank v British Bank for Foreign Trade Ltd [1921] 2 AC 438 at 448, Forster v Jododex Australia Pty Limited [1972] HCA 61 ; (1972) 127 CLR 421 at 437, Transphere at 605.\",\"22\":\"65 One of the authorities discussed by Young J was BMI .
