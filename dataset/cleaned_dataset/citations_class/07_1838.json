The Tribunal did not give detailed reasons for its conclusion in that regard. The conclusion is perhaps implicit from the reasoning of the Tribunal regarding the claims and evidence of the appellant. It is not a question of illogical reasoning. Further, mere illogical reasoning does not of itself found jurisdictional error ( NACB v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 235 at [30] ).\\n\\n15 However, the resignation is only relevant if, contrary to the finding of the Tribunal, the resignation did exist. The Tribunal reached a firm conclusion that the resignation did not exist and gave clear reasons for that conclusion. The finding with respect to s 91R(3) of the Act was not the basis for the Tribunal's conclusion.\\n\\n16 The assertion that the Tribunal acted capriciously and arbitrarily was not, according to the appellant, an allegation of denial of procedural fairness or an allegation of bias. The basis for this ground was that the former member of the Chinese Embassy, who had applied for refugee status, had had his application granted.\",\"1\":\"8 On the application for review to the Federal Magistrate ( SZIOY v Minister for Immigration [2007] FMCA 1359) the appellant raised a number of grounds as to why the Tribunal decision was affected by jurisdictional error: \\n \\n (a) that the Tribunal took into account an irrelevant consideration;\\n (b) that the Tribunal failed to afford procedural fairness; and\\n (c) that the Tribunal acted capriciously and arbitrarily and formed its assessment of satisfaction on illogical reasoning (at [6]).\\n\\n9 By way of particulars the appellant said that the Tribunal's conclusion that he had signed the resignation for the purpose of strengthening his claim was illogical (at [8]). A further particular was that the Tribunal had made an incorrect assumption in assuming that the Chinese authorities were unaware of the resignation.\\n\\n10 Federal Magistrate Nicholls considered the appellant's grounds of review at some length. His Honour found that there was no basis for the assertion that the Tribunal had taken into account an irrelevant consideration (at [13] [14]). In the absence of a transcript of the Tribunal hearing, a copy of which the Registrar had directed the appellant to file, but which was not filed (at [17]), his Honour found there was nothing to support an allegation of a denial of procedural fairness (at [18]).\\n\\n11 In coming to that conclusion, his Honour independently considered whether the Tribunal had complied with procedural statutory requirements. His Honour considered that the conclusions of the Tribunal were logical. In coming to that conclusion his Honour put aside the question of whether or not illogical reasoning would be sufficient to reveal jurisdictional error (at [20]).\\n\\n12 In his notice of appeal from the decision of the Federal Magistrate the appellant raises three grounds. In substance, those grounds are: \\n \\n 1. That the Tribunal's conclusions were based on illogical reasoning. \\n 2. That the Tribunal acted capriciously and arbitrarily.\\n 3. That the Tribunal made an incorrect assumption in assuming that the Chinese authorities were unaware of the resignation.\\n\\n13 The appellant appeared in this appeal in person assisted by an interpreter. When asked for particulars of this ground, the appellant raised factual matters centred around what he says is the current position in China regarding freedom of speech. Those matters are not relevant to the appeal.\"}}"
