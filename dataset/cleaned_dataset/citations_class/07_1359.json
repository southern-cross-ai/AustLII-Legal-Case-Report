I agree with that submission in relation to a significant portion of the evidence namely that relating to construction of both the patent in suit and the priority document. In my opinion, that evidence does not supply technical explanations from the deponent's field of expertise that would assist in placing the Court in the position of a skilled addressee of those documents. Rather, they constitute the reading of the documents by the deponent. ( Jupiters Ltd v Neurizon Pty Ltd (2005) 222 ALR 155 at [67].) In my opinion, that evidence is not admissible and, if it were, it would be rejected pursuant to s 135 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) . I do not need to make a formal ruling as to admissibility. I indicate I will not grant leave to read paragraphs 23 39 (inclusive), 46 and 52 56 (inclusive) of the affidavit.\\n\\n4 Paragraphs 40 44 (inclusive) of the affidavit could conceivably be relevant to the issue of inventive step. Standing alone, they would not be sufficient to establish the point. However, the issues raised by s 7(2) and s 7(3) of the Patents Act 1990 (Cth) involve a number of factual aspects that may be proved from a number of sources. As was said in Jupiters 222 ALR 155 at [154]:\\n \\n \\\" Section 7(2) of the Act refers to the hypothetical person 'skilled in the relevant art in the light of the common general knowledge as it existed in the patent area before the priority date of the relevant claim'. That person is wholly hypothetical. Much evidence is admissible from persons none of whom would precisely answer the statutory description. Some may be more skilled in the relevant art than others. Some may be skilled and inventive; some may be brilliant; some may be plodders; some may be aware of particular pieces of art claimed to be part of the common general knowledge and others not. It is for the Court, having admitted relevant evidence, to come to a conclusion as to the application of the section.\\\" \\n \\n\\n(See also, generally, Lockwood Security Products Pty Ltd v Doric Products Pty Ltd (No 2) (2007) 235 ALR 202.) It is not possible to rule in advance as to that issue.\",\"1\":\"7 The role of case management is relevant. The wide scope of O 10 of the Federal Court Rules is well established (eg Lenijamar Pty Ltd v AGC (Advances) Ltd (1990) 27 FCR 388); see also s 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). In my opinion, the effect of the decision of the High Court in State of Queensland v JL Holdings Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 1 ; (1997) 189 CLR 146 on case management has been exaggerated. It dealt with a special situation prevention of litigating a fairly arguable defence some months before a trial date. Even so, it may prove to be the high water mark of anti case-management philosophy, probably as a reaction to some perceived over zealous case management in New South Wales at the time. The decision in Sali v SPC Ltd [1993] HCA 47 ; (1993) 116 ALR 625; (1993) 67 ALJR 841, still needs to be considered. In any event, the evidence of one expert is not necessary to achieve the attainment of justice.\",\"2\":\"4 Paragraphs 40 44 (inclusive) of the affidavit could conceivably be relevant to the issue of inventive step.
