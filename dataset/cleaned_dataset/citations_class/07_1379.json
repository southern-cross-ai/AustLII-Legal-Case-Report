She said (at [35]): \\n \\n Counsel for the First Respondent correctly submitted that the common law principles of procedural fairness identified by the High Court in Kioa are not necessarily applicable to the proceeding before this Court. Section 422B of the Act has the effect that all that is required of the Tribunal in so far as procedural fairness is concerned is to comply with the provisions of the Act ( Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Lay Lat [(2006) [2006] FCAFC 61 ; 151 FCR 214] and SZCIJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 62). Accordingly, the Applicant's written submissions referring to the common law rule of procedural fairness are misconceived in so-far as they relate to the matter before this Court.\\n\\n34 No separate submissions were made in respect of this appeal ground. It appears to be a revisiting of the Kioa [1985] HCA 81 ; 159 CLR 550 point. The scope of the hearing rule aspect of the rules of procedural fairness is limited by s 422B as already discussed. This ground therefore fails.\\n\\n35 No submission was made in support of this ground. No factual basis for it was identified. This ground fails.\\n\\n36 The appellant referred to s 424 empowering the Tribunal to obtain any information that it considers relevant. He contended that this did not authorise the Tribunal to get any information from any source. In this respect there is no basis for the contention that the Tribunal or the learned magistrate erred. In so saying I would express my concern about the quality of some of the information on which the Tribunal acted. A six year old report of a telephone conversation between somebody unknown in a Canadian agency, with somebody unknown in an American University, might not be thought to provide a particularly solid foundation for an important administrative decision which could affect the life or liberty of the person concerned. In fairness however, it must be acknowledged that the independent evidence relating to the treatment of Burghers in Sri Lanka was peripheral to the case and relevant to a matter which the Tribunal raised as a possible basis for the grant of a protection visa. The matter of persecution on the grounds of ethnicity had not been raised by the appellant.\",\"1\":\"28 The grounds of appeal were in the following terms: \\n \\n \\n 1.

Section 51A relates to ministerial grants of visas to non-citizens. Its effect is similar to that of s 422B in its application to Tribunal hearings. Similar provision is made by s 357A in relation to Migration Review Tribunal hearings. The operation of these sections has been considered in a large number of authorities which were referred to by the Full Court in its judgment. The Court said, in relation to Subdiv AB in which s 51A is found: \\n \\n \\n 66. What was intended was that Subdiv AB provide comprehensive procedural codes which contain detailed provisions for procedural fairness but which exclude the common law natural justice hearing rule. \\n \\n 67.
