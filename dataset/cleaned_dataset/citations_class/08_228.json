The words 'casual, accidental or unintentional' do not introduce such an additional requirement. Viewed in the context of the extract from the joint judgment in Mudginberri cited at [30] above, the qualifications are not so much true exceptions to a deliberate act or omission; rather they are by way of contradiction to such an act or omission.\\n\\n35 In this context, his Honour's statement at [65] of the propositions he saw as having been established in relation to the general law of contempt by the reasons of the High Court in Mudginberri and in Witham v Holloway [1995] HCA 3 ; (1995) 183 CLR 525 at 530 534 per Brennan, Deane, Toohey and Gaudron JJ and 538 542 per McHugh J, is instructive:\\n \\n \\n '(a) disobedience of an order of the court, or of an undertaking to the court, is aptly described as a contempt of court; this is so regardless of whether the disobedience is attended by the contumacy previously thought necessary to attract the special description of \\\"criminal contempt\\\";\\n \\n (b) the dichotomy previously recognised between civil contempt and criminal contempt was based, in part at least, on the different rationales which were understood to inform the different kinds of contempt: civil contempt was understood to be concerned with disciplining the party in breach in vindication of the private interests of the parties to civil litigation while criminal contempt was understood to be concerned with the punishment of the offender in vindication of the public interest in the due administration of justice, and, in particular, the maintenance of the authority of the courts;\\n \\n (c) just as the historical differentiation between discipline and punishment and the vindication of the private interest and the public interest can no longer be sustained, so punishment by way of a fine or imprisonment as a remedy for contempt may be imposed where the disobedience of a court order is more than \\\"casual, accidental or unintentional\\\". It is now not essential to show that the disobedience is contumacious or defiant;\\n \\n (d) because the sanction for any contempt is inevitably to some extent punitive, all contempts must be proved beyond reasonable doubt.'\",\"1\":\"31 The applicants submit that it is no answer to proceedings for contempt to say that there was no direct intention to disobey the order. It is enough that the relevant commission or omission was deliberate and not casual, accidental or unintentional. They find support for that in what was said by Jerrard JA in Lade & Co Pty Ltd v Black [2006] QCA 294 at [24] :\\n \\n \\n 'Contempt is established by proof of a deliberate act or omission which breaches an order or undertaking. It is no defence that the party deliberately doing the act honestly believes, or was wrongly advised, that it would not be in breach of the order, if the act was deliberately done.'\\n \\n \\n\\nAnd at [26]:\\n \\n \\n 'I consider it follows that a deliberate act or omission which is in fact in breach of an order will constitute contempt, and to prove contempt it is necessary and sufficient to prove that much. There will be no contempt proved if the act or omission is \\\"casual, accidental or unintentional\\\".'\\n\\n32 It is here where the respondents parted company. They submitted that the Court does not look to whether the act of publication itself was more than 'casual, accidental or unintentional'. These qualifications, they say, are placed upon the disobedience, not upon the 'commission or omission which is in breach'. In order to become contemptuous, Mr Chatham's disobedience to the Orders must have been more than 'casual, accidental or unintentional'. He may have published the material in breach of the Orders deliberately, but if the disobedience was merely 'casual, accidental or unintentional', then he is not guilty of contempt.\\n\\n34 This is not to say that there can be contempt without disobedience. As Keane JA said in Lade at [63]:\\n \\n \\n 'There must, of course, be actual disobedience. There cannot be disobedience if the alleged contemnor does not know of the order which he or she is alleged to have breached. Nor could there be disobedience where the breach of the order occurs by reason of circumstances outside the control of the alleged contemnor. But if the facts of the case enable one fairly to conclude that the alleged contemnor has disobeyed the order or undertaking then that is sufficient to constitute a contempt.'\",\"2\":\"35 In this context, his Honour's statement at [65] of the propositions he saw as having been established in relation to the general law of contempt by the reasons of the High Court in Mudginberri and in Witham v Holloway [1995] HCA 3 ; (1995) 183 CLR 525 at 530 534 per Brennan, Deane, Toohey and Gaudron JJ and 538 542 per McHugh J, is instructive:\\n \\n \\n '(a) disobedience of an order of the court, or of an undertaking to the court, is aptly described as a contempt of court; this is so regardless of whether the disobedience is attended by the contumacy previously thought necessary to attract the special description of \\\"criminal contempt\\\";\\n \\n (b) the dichotomy previously recognised between civil contempt and criminal contempt was based, in part at least, on the different rationales which were understood to inform the different kinds of contempt: civil contempt was understood to be concerned with disciplining the party in breach in vindication of the private interests of the parties to civil litigation while criminal contempt was understood to be concerned with the punishment of the offender in vindication of the public interest in the due administration of justice, and, in particular, the maintenance of the authority of the courts;\\n \\n (c) just as the historical differentiation between discipline and punishment and the vindication of the private interest and the public interest can no longer be sustained, so punishment by way of a fine or imprisonment as a remedy for contempt may be imposed where the disobedience of a court order is more than \\\"casual, accidental or unintentional\\\".
