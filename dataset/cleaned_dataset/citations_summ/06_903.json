    "text": "in accordance with the practice of the federal court in some cases of public interest, importance or complexity, the following summary has been prepared to accompany the orders made today. this summary is intended to assist in understanding the outcome of this proceeding and is not a complete statement of the conclusions reached by the court. the only authoritative statement of the court's reasons is that contained in the published reasons for judgment which will be available on the internet at http://www.fedcourt.gov.au/ together with this summary. put shortly but inexactly, the present application has been made on behalf of torres strait islanders who are descendants of an extensive list of named ancestors who were themselves torres strait islanders. to prevent further delay in the hearing of the application, the original claim area has been divided into parts a and b. my reasons relate only to part a. it encompasses the greater part of the original claim area. the principal respondents in this part are the state of queensland, the commonwealth of australia, a large group of people and companies collectively described as the commercial fishing parties and a small number of parties from papua new guinea. for native title act purposes, torres strait and the torres strait islanders are distinctive in many respects. that this is so, and the consequences of it, are markedly apparent in my reasons. the subject matter of the present proceeding is itself distinctive. it seeks a determination of native title rights and interests in a major part of the sea area of torres strait. the sea in turn is the integral presence in the lives and livelihoods of the islander communities. it has rightly been said that their occupation of the region has had \"an essentially maritime character\". unlike in native title claims in aboriginal australia, the laws and customs advanced by the communities do not reflect an overarching spiritual connection with the waters. there is no creation story. yet there are still some, for the most part minor, traditional spiritual beliefs revealed in the evidence. in consequence, the laws and customs of present concern are informed in quite some degree by considerations of utility and practicality. this has unusual ramifications in the application of accepted native title act jurisprudence. no more is this so than in relation to the \"connection\" requirement of s 223(1)(b) of the native title act 1993 (cth). the applicant's evidence is likewise distinctive. british and then australian sovereignty over the islands of torres strait was acquired for the most part in progressive steps taken, first, in 1872 and then in 1879. by these dates the grandparents of some of the indigenous witnesses were alive and were directly, or via the witness' parents, the sources of oral traditions recounted by those witnesses. from the time of luis baez de torres' passage through the strait in 1606, islander contact with europeans was the subject of recorded account and observation. notable amongst these after cook's rediscovery of torres strait were the writings of british naval officers and other mariners. in 1864 a joint imperial-colonial outpost was established at somerset on the eastern tip of cape york. at much the same time colonial occupation commenced in the strait. it related initially to the establishment of b&ecirc;che-de-mer shore fishing stations. in 1868 the pearl shell industry commenced. in 1871 the evangelisation of the strait began with the advent of the london missionary society. in consequence a significant pre",

    "text": "and early sovereignty literature was generated and is in evidence. the most significant body of works in this are the six volumes of reports of the cambridge anthropological expedition to torres strait. these were based largely on observations made in the strait in 1898 by a.c. haddon (a former zoologist) and six others. the main purpose of the expedition was to assemble a picture of life before colonisation from the memories of the older men. unlike with so much of aboriginal australia, the acquisition of sovereignty over the islands of the strait did not lead to the islanders being dispossessed of their lands or sea domains, or deprived of their traditional means of livelihood. their continuing presence in the strait is self-evident as are their detailed knowledge of, and exploitation of the marine resources of, the strait. as is now well known, native title was first accepted and recognised in relation to the murray islands in torres strait in the decision of mabo v queensland [no 2] [1992] hca 23 ; (1992) 175 clr 1. that decision and the twenty-two consent determinations since made under the subsequently enacted native title act have resulted in the recognition of native title in all of the presently inhabited islands of interest in this proceeding and in most of the uninhabited islands. characteristically the native title holders in these determinations were found to be members of single island communities. in several instances, though, the title is shared by members of several island communities. though the land determinations are of some contextual importance in this proceeding, it is to be emphasised that the present application relates to sea water areas. because of its present importance, i should emphasise that the nt act defines \"waters\" to include not only \"sea ... a tidal inlet, a bay, an estuary\" but also \"the bed or subsoil under ... any waters\" and \"the shore, or subsoil under ... the shore, between high water and low water\": s 253. the term is used with this meaning in my reasons. it also requires emphasis that, to the islanders, land and sea are seamlessly and culturally associated: there is no \"sea-land dichotomy\". i have concluded that the applicant has, for the most part, established its claim. there is a single torres strait islander society to which the native title claim group belongs. under that society's traditional laws acknowledged and traditional customs observed, the claim group in aggregate holds native title rights and interests in the waters of torres strait with which i am presently concerned, save in those parts specified in my reasons. as the present proceeding does not involve the entirety of the native title claim area, it is inappropriate that i make a finding that the claim group alone constitutes the relevant society. it may be the case",
