(\"network\"). the deed provided that in consideration for certain loans by network, the trustees would deliver to network all of the issued shares of wellington on the completion of the scheme. the amounts lent pursuant to the deed were calculated by reference to the value of tax losses confirmed by the deputy commissioner of taxation.  mr. king thereafter co-operated with the scheme trustees in a manner which was inconsistent with his own rights and interest as a shareholder in wellington but which was necessary for the operation of the scheme.",
