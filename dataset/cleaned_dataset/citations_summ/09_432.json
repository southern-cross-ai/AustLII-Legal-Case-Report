    "text": "income tax assessment act 1936 (cth), s. 25. following the judgment on 23 april 1983 of a single judge of the federal court of australia (the court), the trade practices commission had recovered from the appellant company simpson ltd (formerly known as simpson pope ltd) (the appellant) a pecuniary penalty under ss. 76 and 77 of the trade practices act 1974 (cth) (the act) by reason of contraventions by the appellant of the provisions of s. 48 of the act relating to the practice of resale price maintenance. pursuant to s. 82 of the act, the respondent company hubbards pty ltd recovered damages of $52,373 being the sums of $49,477 plus $13,330, totalling $62,807, less a discount in respect of income tax of $10,434.  the appellant appealed and the respondent cross-appealed to the full court against the assessment of damages which had been calculated having regard to the \"lost sales\" of simpson products over a specified period. in calculating the net profit on sales the learned trial judge had made a deduction to allow for an expected increase in bankcard charges and a reduction attributable to notional sales other than simpson products referable to the bankcard component in sales by the respondent. the appellant contended that the overall award was excessive and submitted, inter alia, that the learned trial judge had erred in calculating the net profit on sales; that a reduction attributable to notional sales of other than simpson products referable to the bankcard component had not been allowed; that, while the learned trial judge had correctly made some allowance for income tax in respect of the damages awarded, a full allowance of forty-six per cent should have been allowed, rather than taking into account tax losses; and that the overall award was excessive.  the respondent submitted that the incidence of tax should have been ignored in the award of damages contending that, if the amount was assessable, this could have been determined elsewhere and having regard to the state of profit or losses which existed at the relevant time of receipt.  held: (1) the learned trial judge was justified, on the evidence before him, in treating the damages to be awarded for loss of profit in the calendar year 1979 as probably assessable income within the meaning of s. 25 of the income tax assessment act 1936 (cth). the commissioner of taxation was not a party and, in view of the concession made by the appellant the full court was not required to finally determine the question of liability of tax.  stoke-on-trent city council v. wood mitchell &amp; co. ltd (1980) 1 wlr 254 , referred to.  (2) the basic principle which was applicable was that damages were compensatory. if the damages were taxable in this case it followed that, if forty-six per cent were deducted from the calculation and the balance only awarded as damages, this balance would be taxable in the hands of the respondent at forty-six per cent. in other words, the respondent would in effect, if the damages were taxable, be taxed at twice the rate of forty-six per cent and the commissioner of taxation would be deprived of part of the tax he might have received, the benefit of this being passed to the appellant. in addition, it would have meant that the respondent would not have been properly compensated for its loss.",
