(2) section 74d of the act implied only a condition where the manufacturer supplied the goods to another person who acquired the goods for re-supply, it did not relate to an agreement between the manufacturer and consumer. further, the federal court does not have jurisdiction to grant relief in a claim arising solely pursuant to s.74d.",
