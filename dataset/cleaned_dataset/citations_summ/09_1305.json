(\"canberra abattoir\"), a company which conducted an abattoir in the australian capital territory, held for tillmanns thirty-two cattle awaiting slaughter and the carcasses of twenty head of cattle and seventeen pigs. as a result of the black ban by the union the live cattle were not slaughtered for some weeks and the carcasses were released to tillmanns only about a week later to avoid deterioration. the appellant instituted an action in the federal court of australia seeking an injunction and damages under ss. 80 and 82 in relation to s. 45d of the trade practices act 1974 (\"the act \") alleging that the respondents acted in concert to prevent supplies of meat to tillmanns in breach of s. 45d of the act . the trial judge declined to find that the respondents' conduct had the relevant effect and refused to award damages or to grant an injunction. he stated in his judgment, inter alia, that the plaintiff (appellant) was not entitled to argue that the conduct complained of would be likely to cause substantial loss where the means of proving whether in fact it did cause substantial loss were in its power. the appellant appealed to the full court of the federal court of australia against this judgment claiming that an injunction should have been ordered.  held: per curiam",
