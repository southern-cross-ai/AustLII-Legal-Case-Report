(2) section 135m(1) of the act confers a discretion on the director-general to cancel or suspend a pension of a person; such discretion to be exercised having regard to the age and the mental and physical capacity of that person and to the facilities available to that person for suitable treatment for physical rehabilitation and suitable training for a vocation.  (3) that when s. 135m(1) refers to the director-general having regard to \"the facilities available to that person for suitable treatment for physical rehabilitation and suitable training for a vocation\" it does not refer to the general physical rehabilitation of an ailment; it is limited to rehabilitation for a contemplated vocation.",
