(2) the proceeding would be adjourned to a specified date to deal further with the application by the applicants for inspection of the documents produced to the court by the police commissioner, and with the application by the applicants for production and inspection of the documents subpoenaed from the director-general of a.s.i.o.  (3) the final decision concerning the production of documents by the director-general of a.s.i.o. rested with the court, not with the executive.  haj-ismail v. minister for immigration and ethnic affairs [1981] fca 124 ; (1981) 56 flr 67 ; sankey v. whitlam [1978] hca 43 ; (1978) 142 clr 1 ; united states v. nixon [1974] ussc 159 ; (1974) 418 us 683 ; conway v. rimmer [1968] ukhl 2 ; (1968) ac 910 ; australian national airlines commission v. commonwealth [1975] hca 33 ; (1975) 132 clr 582 ; lanyon pty. ltd. v. commonwealth [1974] hca 11 ; (1974) 129 clr 650 ; re grosvenor hotel london (no. 2) (1965) ch 1210 ; burmah oil co. ltd. v. governor and company of the bank of england [1979] ukhl 4 ; (1980) ac 1090 , referred to.  per lockhart j.",

(no. 2) (1981) nzlr 153 ; sankey v. whitlam [1978] hca 43 ; (1978) 142 clr 1 , referred to.  (4) the court's power to inspect documents should be exercised only if, after considering the affidavits or certificates of the acting attorney-general or the director-general of a.s.i.o., the issues in the case and the relevance of the documents, the court was in doubt whether they would be likely to contain material helpful to the case of the applicants as the parties seeking production of the documents.  sankey v. whitlam [1978] hca 43 ; (1978) 142 clr 1 , referred to.  (5) having inspected the documents the court was satisfied that the interests of justice did not require the disclosure to the applicants of the documents or parts of documents where objection was taken to their being inspected by the applicants, and the applicants would suffer no injustice by non-disclosure.  r. v. debic unreported (new south wales court of appeal, 27th may, 1982), referred to.  (6) as neither the acting attorney-general nor the director-general of a.s.i.o. swore that he had personally examined the documents which he objected to producing, nor were the documents identified with any precision, the acting attorney-general and the director-general should be afforded an opportunity to reconsider the matter of the production of the documents, including the swearing of further affidavits. further consideration might then be given to the inspection of the documents by the court and submissions may be made by the parties and the director-general of a.s.i.o.",
