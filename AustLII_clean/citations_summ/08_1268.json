(for ease of reference, both the application and appeal may be collectively referred to as \" the appeal \"). the consequence of this finding was that the commission had jurisdiction to hear and determine the respondent's application for a remedy in respect of his alleged unfair dismissal. it was not in contest between the parties at first instance or on appeal that if the appellant was a trading corporation the commission would not have jurisdiction because of the contents of s5 , s 6 and s 16 of the workplace relations act 1996 (cth) ( the wra ) and s109 of the constitution .

    "text": "cti logistics (2006) 86 waig 3278 per kenner c at paragraphs [15]-[19]).  the proceedings at first instance the application was filed on 18 august 2006, pursuant to s29(1)(b) of the industrial relations act 1979 (wa) ( the act ). it contended that on or about 21 july 2006 the respondent's employment as a solicitor with the appellant was terminated harshly, oppressively and unfairly. the appellant filed a notice of answer and counter proposal which opposed the respondent's claim. the answer did not raise any objection to jurisdiction. this occurred subsequently following a change in the appellant's solicitors. the appellant's new solicitors, who remained their solicitors for the appeal, advised the commission that the appellant intended to raise as a preliminary issue, that it is a trading corporation for the purposes of s51(xx) of the commonwealth constitution and s4 of the wra . as a result, the original dates listed to hear the application at first instance were vacated and directions were made to hear the objection to jurisdiction. this included the service of notices pursuant to s78b of the judiciary act 1903 (cth). the evidence before the commission on the preliminary issue, was primarily in the form of affidavits filed by the parties which annexed relevant documents. for the appellant, affidavits were sworn/affirmed by mr dennis eggington, the chief executive officer of the appellant, and mr andrew grist, the in-house accountant of the appellant. the respondent also affirmed an affidavit. the commission heard the preliminary issue on 17 november 2006. at the hearing the affidavits were formally received into evidence and mr eggington was cross-examined. the commission reserved its decision. on 19 december 2006 the commission published its reasons for decision. it concluded that the appellant was not a trading corporation and accordingly the application should be re-listed for the hearing of the substantive claim. as stated the appeal is against the decision of the commission that it had jurisdiction to determine the substantive claim, on the basis that the appellant was not a trading corporation.  section 78b of the judiciary act 1903 (cth) and intervention by the minister as instructed, my associate wrote to the appellant's solicitors, with a copy to the respondent's solicitors, on 25 january 2007 to request that notices be issued to attorneys general under s78b of the judiciary act 1903 (cth). this request was complied with by the appellant's solicitors on 31 january 2007. by the time of the hearing of the appeal, all of the attorneys general had advised the appellant that they did not wish to intervene in the appeal. on the day before the hearing of the appeal, however, the full bench received notice from the state solicitor's office, acting on behalf of the minister for employment protection, that the minister was going to seek the leave of the full bench to intervene. this was pursuant to s30(1) of the act . an outline of submissions on behalf of the minister was received later that day. at the commencement of the hearing, leave was granted to the minister to intervene. there was no opposition to the full bench taking this course and the full bench considered, given the subject matter of the appeal, that it was appropriate to grant leave.  leave to appeal the decision by the commission at first instance that the appellant was not a trading corporation and therefore the commission had jurisdiction, was a \" finding \" as defined in s7 of the act . this is because the decision made by the commission did not finally decide, determine or dispose of the respondent's application. as such, the appellant faces the hurdle of s49(2a) of the act in seeking to appeal against the finding. section 49(2a) provides that an \" appeal does not lie under this section from a finding unless, in the opinion of the full bench, the matter is of such importance that, in the public interest, an appeal should lie \". in the schedule to the notice of appeal, the appellant said that the matter of what constitutes a trading corporation for the purpose of the definition of constitutional corporation in the wra is now central to whether the commission has jurisdiction in relation to corporations in unfair dismissal matters. the schedule said that of itself, further and alternatively because the full bench has not previously considered the matter, it is of such importance that it is in the public interest that leave to appeal be granted. in their written outline of submissions, the appellant contended that leave ought to be granted for an additional reason. this was that it was desirable in the public interest for the appellant's attention and resources to be directed to and expended on continuing to perform the contract which it had with the commonwealth, to provide services to indigenous persons, without the inconvenience of having to further engage in litigation in this matter. the submissions added that the appellant would in any event be entitled to appeal against the final decision of the commission on the ground raised in the appeal. (this probably assumes the substantive application would be decided against the appellant). the respondent opposed the granting of leave. the first basis for this was a submission that the issue on appeal was a fairly narrow one and did not involve an issue so broadly relating to the jurisdiction of the commission as described by the appellant. the second basis was that the additional or alternative contention of the appellant offended the notion of all parties being equal before the law. the minister made no submissions on this issue. in our opinion on the basis of the first ground argued by the appellant, it is appropriate to grant leave to appeal. this is because the appeal requires the full bench to consider the correctness of the approach taken by the commission in determining the question of whether the appellant is a trading corporation. also in our opinion the appeal does involve a consideration of what is meant by trading corporation and trading. these issues are all important because of the consequence of a determination of whether a corporation is a trading corporation, for the jurisdiction of the commission. in murdoch university v lhmu (2005) 86 waig 247 we set out, with the agreement of gregor sc and smith c, the meaning of the public interest requirement contained in s49(2a) of the act as follows:",

    "text": "\" 12 the appellant accepted that the order made by the commission was a \"finding\" as defined in s7 of the act. this was because the order did not finally dispose of the matter before the commission at first instance. accordingly, the appellant also accepted that s49(2a) of the act applied to the appeal. this subsection provides that an appeal does not lie from a finding unless, in the opinion of the full bench, the matter is of such importance that, in the public interest, an appeal should lie. the subsection focuses the attention of the full bench upon \"the matter\". it seems that a determination is to be made as to whether the matter, as opposed to individual appeal grounds, is of such importance that, in the public interest, an appeal should lie. accordingly, it seems that the full bench may not form the opinion that an appeal should lie on only some of the grounds.   in rria v amwsu and others (1989) 69 waig 1873 , the full bench at 1879 said that the words \"public interest\" in s49(2a) of the act should not be narrowed to mean \"special or extraordinary circumstances\". as stated by the full bench, an application may involve circumstances which are neither special nor extraordinary but which are, because of their very generality, of great importance in the public interest. the full bench, on the same page, went on to say that important questions with likely repercussions in other industries and substantial matters of law affecting jurisdiction can give rise to matters of sufficient importance in the public interest to justify an appeal. the rria decision was cited with approval and applied in the recent full bench decision of csa v shean (2005) 85 waig 2993 at 2995-2997.",
