[3] it has been said, however, that there are three possible grounds for restraining a legal practitioner from acting for a party to litigation: [4] the inherent jurisdiction or implied power of the court to supervise and control the conduct of legal practitioners as officers of the court (in order to safeguard the due administration of justice); a breach of a supposed fiduciary duty of loyalty not to act against a client, or against a former client, in the same matter or a closely related matter; and the danger of misuse of confidential information. i shall refer to the first of the above grounds as \"the supervision and control ground\". i shall refer to the second and third grounds as \"the duty of loyalty ground\" and \"the confidential information ground\" respectively. an application to restrain a legal practitioner from acting for a party to litigation must be made without delay, and failure to take the point at an early stage might well cast doubt on the validity of any subsequent complaint. [5] the supervision and control ground leaving aside any questions relating to whether this court has inherent jurisdiction, as opposed to \"an implied incidental power to make orders necessarily incidental to express powers\", [6] the test to be applied in relation to the supervision and control ground seems to be \"whether a fair-minded, reasonably informed member of the public would conclude that the proper administration of justice requires that a legal practitioner should be prevented from acting",

[7] such jurisdiction or power as is inherent in the supervision and control ground should be regarded as exceptional, and must be exercised with caution, [8] with \"due weight\" being given to the public interest in a litigant not being deprived of his or her lawyer of choice without a good reason. [9] in state of western australia v ward and ors, [10] the full court of the federal court said: [11] ... the requirements of natural justice do not involve an absolute right to the legal adviser of a party's choice. the instances in which courts have prevented chosen counsel or solicitors from acting have involved misconduct, potential use of confidential information, and a real risk of lack of objectivity and of conflict of interest and duty ... the present case (i.e. state of western australia v ward) is only another example of situations in which the \"integrity of the judicial process\", the \"interests of justice\" and the \"need to preserve confidence in the judicial system\", to use some of the notions that lie behind the inherent jurisdiction to exclude counsel or solicitors, may override the public interest that a litigant be able to be represented by the lawyer of its choice. that public interest is \"an important value\". ... it is a serious matter to prevent a party from retaining its chosen lawyer. ... but ... particular circumstances may require some modification of the public interest in the ability of a litigant to have a lawyer of its choice. it is, of course, settled law that legal practitioners have duties to the court, as well as duties to their clients, and that the former necessarily override the latter. [12] put another way, a legal practitioner's duty to the client is subordinate to his or her duty to the court",

    "text": "which duty remains paramount even if the client gives instructions to the contrary. [13] indeed, unlike a legal practitioner's duty to a client (which can be waived or ratified by a properly informed and advised client who is not under any disability), a legal practitioner's duty to the court cannot be waived. [14] . the practical implications of legal practitioners' overriding or paramount duties to the court were described by heenan j in holborow v macdonald rudder : [15] if there are circumstances which are likely to imperil the discharge of these duties to a court by a legal practitioner acting in a cause, whether because of some prior association with one or more of the parties against whom the practitioner is then to act, or because of some conduct by the practitioner, whether arising from associations with the client or a close interest which gives rise to the fair and reasonable perception that the practitioner may not exercise the necessary independent judgment, a court may conclude that the lawyer should be restrained from acting, even for a client who desires to continue his service. the inherent jurisdiction or implied incidental power referred to in the supervision and control ground has been invoked in cases where there was a potential that the legal practitioner might become a witness in the proceedings, and where the subject matter of litigation was likely to involve an evaluation of the legal practitioner's conduct. [16] it has also been held that it may be appropriate to invoke the jurisdiction or power in a case where the practitioner might feel impelled to justify or defend his or her conduct in representing a client, or where the legal practitioner's credibility could be at stake. [17] the potential misuse of information which might not comfortably be described as \"confidential information\" also falls within this general category. for example, legal practitioners can often learn a great deal about a client's personality, weaknesses or strengths, honesty (or perhaps dishonesty), fears and reactions (including reactions to pressure or tension). similarly, legal practitioners can learn much about a client's attitude and approach to litigation. in yunghanns v elfic ltd , [18] gillard j described these considerations as \"getting to know you\" factors. in a case where a former client's credibility becomes a matter of significance, his or her former legal practitioner's knowledge of the \"getting to know you\" factors can become a powerful weapon at the disposal of the practitioner's new client. irrespective of the actual effectiveness of the weapon, it can be anticipated that the former client would feel anxiety about the potential of being cross examined by a practitioner who might be perceived as being in a position of unfair superiority",

    "text": "which was a decision (although not in the family law jurisdiction) dealing with an employed solicitor changing firms: in preparing for the hearing of a contentious matter, a client will often be required to reveal to the lawyer retained highly confidential information. the client's most secret devices and desires, the client's most frightening fears, will often, of necessity, be revealed. the client must be secure in the knowledge that the lawyer will neither disclose nor take advantage of these revelations. our judicial system could not operate if this were not the case. it cannot function properly if doubt or suspicion exists in the mind of the public that the confidential information disclosed by a client to a lawyer might be revealed. it is very important, however, not to elevate the significance of the \"getting to know you\" factors. indeed, it is crucial to evaluate and inform their relevance in the broader context of the inherent jurisdiction or implied power of the court to supervise and control the conduct of legal practitioners as officers of the court (in order to safeguard the due administration of justice). thus, and as heerey j said in mintel international group limited v mintel (australia) pty ltd : [23] insofar as reliance is placed on the \"getting to know you\" principle, a moment's consideration of the way that litigation is conducted in australia shows that this cannot be accepted too literally, especially in relation to counsel. there are many bodies such as commonwealth and state government entities, banks, insurers, media companies and many others which are constantly engaged in litigation. counsel retained to act on behalf of such bodies inevitably acquire information, not confidential information in the strict sense, but experience as to the corporate culture of the clients, their internal policies, the way they deal with litigation, tactics, the personalities of important decision-makers and so forth. i do not accept that general experience of that kind would impose what presumably on the respondent's argument would be lifetime restraints on counsel from acting against such a body. indeed it is a feature of an independent bar that counsel might appear one day on behalf of such a body and the next day against it. while perhaps strange to observers from countries where the legal profession is organised differently, this freedom enhances the independence of counsel and their capacity to give objective and sometimes unwelcome advice. the cab rank rule works both ways. the driver is obliged to accept the fare, but the fare does not buy the service of the driver beyond the stipulated journey. the duty of loyalty ground it is likely that any supposed fiduciary duty of loyalty owed by a legal practitioner to his/her client does not survive the termination of the retainer. in ismail-zai v the state of western australia (2007) waca 150 , steytler p said: 23. in my opinion, the weight of authority currently supports the proposition that the duty of loyalty does not survive the termination of the retainer. moreover, some of the cases which support the existence of a continuing duty of loyalty seem ... to draw no clear distinction between a fiduciary obligation of that kind, on the one hand, and the court's inherent supervisory jurisdiction to protect the integrity of the judicial process, on the other. ... 24. in any event, ... there may be little distinction, for any practical purpose, between the question whether there is a breach of the continuing duty of loyalty, on the one hand, and the question is whether there is a real risk of a breach of confidence and whether there is or will be other impropriety of a kind that is likely to undermine the integrity of the judicial process and the due administration of justice (which comprehends the appearance of justice), on the other hand. ... i find it difficult to envisage circumstances in which a lawyer who acts in the same or a closely related matter against a former client will neither be in a position in which there is a real risk of a breach of duty of confidence nor be acting in such a way as to undermine the integrity of the judicial process or the due administration of justice. i agree with the above analysis, and conclude that the second ground for restraining a legal practitioner from acting against a former client (being the duty of loyalty ground) is, in essence, a restatement of the first and third grounds (being the supervision and control ground and the confidential information ground) in omnibus form. put another way: ... because of the frequent recourse to the term \"duty of loyalty\" ..., it is necessary to emphasise that that eloquent, but elastic, term is not itself precise. the measure of the obligation upon the former (legal practitioner) should not be deduced from that description alone but, rather, from an examination of the principles on which courts have acted to regulate or restrict actual or anticipated conduct of former legal advisers. [24] the confidential information ground generally speaking, cases dealing with applications to restrain a legal practitioner from acting in family law proceedings have focused on the confidential information ground, and less frequently on the duty of loyalty ground. the leading authority is the decision of the full court in mcmillan [2000] famca 1046. [25] the confidential information ground, and the effect of mcmillan , were summarised by o'ryan j in pond &amp; thurga (no 2) : [26] prior to (mcmillan) it was uncertain whether a narrow test of actual prejudice (arising from the possible misuse of confidential information) or the broader test of theoretical risk of prejudice was to be applied. ... the full court ultimately adopted the broad approach in mills v day dawn block gold mining company ltd [27] and thevanaz [28] of a theoretical risk of prejudice rather than proof of actual prejudice. the full court found that the narrow or english approach which requires 'real mischief or prejudice' to follow in order to justify court intervention (an approach stemming from rakusen v ellis, munday &amp; clarke [29] ) was inappropriate for the family law jurisdiction. the full court ... cited with approval the summary of the law provided by lindenmayer j in stewart (unreported, 17 april 1997): all that is necessary is that the wife swears that she has conveyed confidential information to the solicitors and that she believes, not unreasonably, that that information may be used against her, or at least to her disadvantage, in these current proceedings. his honour continued: [30] importantly, the adoption of the stricter approach in the family law jurisdiction was borne out of cases concerning practitioners that had acted for both husband and wife and reasons specific to this factual situation. in these cases the reasons for adopting this test have been based on the sensitive nature of the jurisdiction and the in-depth factual inquiries that the court was often required to make into parties' financial history, conduct and contributions. ... although the full court in mcmillan did not (itself) summarise the test to be applied when deciding whether or not to restrain a legal practitioner from acting for a party to litigation on the basis of the confidential information ground, it is clear that its elements are as follows: the party seeking the restraint (\"the complainant\") must: raise a prima facie case that he or she has provided confidential information to the legal practitioner; and demonstrate that there at least a theoretical possibility that the confidential information could be used to the advantage of the other party, or, alternatively, to the disadvantage of the complainant. in order to meet the two requirements in (a) above, the complainant need do no more than depose to the fact that he or she",
