(3) when, as here, the affidavit did not reveal why the alleged counterclaim, set-off or cross demand could not have been set up in the original court proceedings, such affidavit did not comply with the act, with the result that there had been no deemed extension of time to comply with the requirements of the bankruptcy notice.",
