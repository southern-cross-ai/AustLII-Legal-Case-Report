(1) where an employer submitted to union pressure to dismiss a non-striker, there was little likelihood that the dismissal would be actuated by the reason actuating the union: the reason actuating the dismissal would be the placation of the union and this did not constitute a contravention of s. 5 (1) (aa).",
