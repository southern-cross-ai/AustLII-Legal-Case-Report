    "text": "488) (applied by in goldberg v ng [1995] hca 39 ; (1995) 185 clr 83 , 96 deane, dawson, gaudron jj): an implied waiver occurs when, by reason of some conduct on the privilege holder's part, it becomes unfair to maintain the privilege. the holder of the privilege should not be able to abuse it by using it to create an inaccurate perception of the protected communication. professor wigmore explains: 'when his conduct touches a certain point of disclosure, fairness requires that his privilege shall cease whether he intended that result or not. he cannot be allowed, after disclosing as much as he pleases, to withhold the remainder' (wigmore: evidence in trials at common law (1961) vol 8, par 2327, p 636). in order to ensure that the opposing litigant is not misled by an inaccurate perception of the disclosed communication, fairness will usually require that waiver as to one part of a protected communication should result in waiver as to the rest of the communication on that subject matter: see great atlantic insurance co . a copy of the report was provided to the applicants sometime in august 2007. the report was provided to the applicants prior to the meeting of the sstuwa executive on 14 september 2007 which was also prior to the meeting of the state council of the sstuwa on 17 november 2007 at which the decision of the sstuwa executive to dismiss the applicants was endorsed. during oral submissions mr sharpe, however, informed the commission (without objection) that copies of letters from the then president of the intervener to the applicants which were referred to in the report were not provided to the applicants until after the meeting of the executive. the intervener says that the report was provided to the applicants to provide them with procedural fairness as their position was affected. other than obvious fact that the applicants are unable to judge (in the absence of an examination of the legal advice) whether the statements about the advice in the report are accurate or complete, no issue of unfairness to the applicants appears to arise in this matter. on the other hand, the fact that part of the legal advice was disclosed with the purpose of providing procedural fairness to the applicants can be said to raise fairness in favour of the applicants. in providing a copy of the report has the intervener acted inconsistently with the maintenance of the confidentiality which the privilege protects? in my opinion the answer is no, as the purpose for which the portion of legal advice was disclosed was not inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality. in osland the attorney-general disclosed in a press statement that he had made a recommendation to the governor that a petition of mercy be denied and his recommendation was based on independent legal advice. maxwell p in osland ca considered this to be a disclosure 'for the purpose of explaining or justifying' the attorney-general's actions. he found there was no inconsistency between disclosing the fact of, and the conclusions of, the independent advice for that purpose, with wishing to maintain the confidentiality of the advice itself. on appeal to the high court, gleeson cj, gummow, heydon and kiefel jj in osland hca stated in conclusion that the reasoning of maxwell p was correct [50]. kirby j in his separate judgment also agreed there had been no waiver and found the purpose of issuing a press statement was compatible with non-disclosure as the purpose of issuing the press statement was to show the state had taken a proper course in obtaining and considering advice [97]-[98]. the purpose of providing a copy of the report was to provide to the applicants the basis on which the executive acted to make the resolutions to dismiss the applicants in each case from the office as a district delegate to state council. as it is not in dispute that this was done in the interests of natural justice as the position of the applicants were affected, the provision of the copy of the report to the applicants can not be said to be inconsistent with the confidentiality of the privilege as it can not be said that the report was provided to advance a forensic purpose or any other purpose to disadvantage the applicants. for these reasons the applicants' application to set aside legal privilege will be dismissed.",
