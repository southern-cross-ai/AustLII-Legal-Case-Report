Consequently, it is necessary to balance two competing aspects of the public interest, namely the effect upon the administration of justice if the evidence is withheld on the one hand, and the effect upon the wider public interest if the documents are made available for inspection: see generally Alister v The Queen [1983] HCA 45 ; (1983) 154 CLR 404 at 412. It is inappropriate, in my view, simply to take the view that because a document relates to an investigation of criminal conduct, its disclosure would necessarily have a significant adverse consequence to that investigation and so should not be disclosed. It is necessary to consider the particular circumstances of the proceedings and of the documents which are sought to be investigated. It is also necessary to bear in mind, in a matter such as the present, that there is no real public interest in not exposing any illegal conduct on the part of the authorities. That is not to suggest that such conduct is or may be established in this matter, but that is the allegation. I have also borne in mind the intention of the Parliament as evidenced in the ACC Act, in particular ss 29 and 30 and 51(3).\",\"1\":\"The claim for public interest immunity protects from disclosure documents of which the disclosure would be prejudicial or injurious to the public interest: Sankey v Whitlam [1978] HCA 43 ; (1978) 142 CLR 1 at 48-9.
