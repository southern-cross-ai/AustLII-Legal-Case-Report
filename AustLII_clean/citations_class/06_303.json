"{\"id\":{\"0\":\"c0\"},\"class\":{\"0\":\"referred to\"},\"tocase\":{\"0\":\"SZEEU v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 2\"},\"text\":{\"0\":\"21 Finally, because the appellant was unrepresented on the appeal, counsel for the first respondent informed me that the first respondent had considered whether any breach of s 424A(1) of the Act can be said to arise following the decision in SZEEU v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 2. In that regard, counsel submitted that while the Tribunal's knowledge of the date of the appellant's application for the protection visa (December 2003) and the appellant's travel to Australia on a business visa in March 2000 may have derived initially from the protection visa application, this did not mean that s 424A was engaged by those parts of the protection visa application in this case. He submitted that the Tribunal's account of the hearing and the Tribunal's reasons indicate that the Tribunal was relying upon what the appellant said at the hearing about his travel to Australia in 2000 and subsequent activities until lodging his protection visa application in December 2003 as the relevant 'part of the reason' for its decision. He further submitted that on a fair reading the reason for the Tribunal's decision on this issue was based solely on information the appellant gave at the hearing, which falls within s 424A(3)(b). I accept these submissions. Accordingly, there was no breach of s 424A(1) of the Act.\\n\\n22 The appeal must be dismissed with costs.\\n \\n\\n I certify that the preceding twenty-two (22) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Edmonds. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nAssociate:\\n\\nDated: 30 March 2006\\n\\n\\n Solicitor for the Applicant: The appellant appeared in person \\n \\n Counsel for the Respondent: Mr T Reilly \\n \\n Solicitor for the Respondent: Australian Government Solicitor \\n \\n Date of Hearing: 20 March 2006 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 30 March 2006 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2006\\/303.html\"}}"
