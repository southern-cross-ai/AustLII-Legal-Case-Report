The form of order has not been precisely articulated by the applicant, but I will proceed on the basis that an order is sought that the firm Russell Kennedy and Ms Saunders be restrained from acting as solicitors for the first respondent in these proceedings. The background to these proceedings and the role of each of Ms Saunders and Russell Kennedy have been set out in my judgment delivered on 14 March 2007: see Bahonko v Nurses Board of Victoria (No 2) [2007] FCA 351. Essentially, Russell Kennedy are the solicitors on the record representing the first respondent, and Ms Saunders is a solicitor in the employ of Russell Kennedy and has been involved in these proceedings. Other relevant circumstances are referred to later in these reasons.\",\"1\":\"2 The Court's jurisdiction to restrain a legal practitioner from acting in proceedings is an exceptional one and discretionary.

In Bowen v Stott [2004] WASC 94 at [53] and [55], Hasluck J said that it may be appropriate to invoke this power in cases where the legal practitioner may feel compelled to justify or defend his or her conduct in representing a client, or where the practitioner's credibility is at stake as a potential witness.\",\"3\":\"8 In any event, the alleged confidential information is not described, and therefore this Court cannot determine whether there could be any risk or danger that it may be used to the detriment of the applicant in this proceeding.

Further, the Court should be mindful that sometimes applications for restraining legal practitioners may be misused or quite inappropriately pursued by a party to proceedings. In Freeman v Chicago Musical Instrument Co 689 F2d 715 (1982), the Court observed at 722:\\n \\n We do not mean to infer that motions to disqualify counsel may not be legitimate, for there obviously are situations where they are both legitimate and necessary; nonetheless, such motions should be viewed with extreme caution for they can be misused as techniques of harassment.\",\"5\":\"2 The Court's jurisdiction to restrain a legal practitioner from acting in proceedings is an exceptional one and discretionary.

It would appear that the applicant is concerned that Ms Saunders was a member of the Public Interest Law Clearing House ('PILCH') in 2004 when PILCH refused to assist the applicant to bring proceedings against the first respondent, and in the process of considering the applicant's request to PILCH Ms Saunders obtained \\\"confidential documents\\\" from the applicant.\\n\\n6 The only evidential basis of the applicant's complaint derives from [25] of her affidavit affirmed on 31 October 2006: \\n \\n Mrs D. Saunders was on PILCH in 2004 and PILCH refused to assist me against the [first respondent] and instead collected many confidential documents from me which then were liked [sic] to Mrs Saunders. I have circumstantial evidence of that.\\n\\n11 I now turn to consider the issue of the Court's inherent jurisdiction to restrain legal practitioners from acting in a particular case as an incident of its inherent jurisdiction over its officers and to control its process in aid of the administration of justice, where such a course is required in the interests of justice: Geelong School [2006] FCA 1404 at [24] , [32] and [33]. The crucial question is whether, on the evidence before the Court, a fair-minded, reasonably informed member of the public would conclude that the proper administration of justice requires that the legal practitioner be restrained from acting for its client in the proceedings: Geelong School [2006] FCA 1404 at [35] .\\n\\n12 I deal first with the position of Ms Saunders. Serious criminal allegations have been made against Ms Saunders by the applicant. They are denied by Ms Saunders. For the purposes of this application I do not regard it as necessary or appropriate to rehearse in these reasons the details or merits of the allegations. I have, however, come to the view that there is a real likelihood that in these proceedings, assuming the matter proceeds to trial, the conduct of Ms Saunders will require evaluation and assessment and she may well feel compelled to justify or defend her conduct.\",\"6\":\"2 The Court's jurisdiction to restrain a legal practitioner from acting in proceedings is an exceptional one and discretionary.
