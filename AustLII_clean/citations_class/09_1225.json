That is a judgment delivered by Nicholson J in Australian Communications and Media Authority v Clarity1 Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1399 ; (2006) 155 FCR 377 (Clarity1). One finds, with respect, in his Honour's judgment in Clarity1 a very helpful collation indeed of relevant principle.\\n\\nIt is apparent from Clarity1 that Nicholson J was of the opinion that assistance was to be derived in terms of principle from judgments delivered in respect of civil penalties imposed under the Trade Practices Act . I respectfully agree with this approach.\\n\\nTo that end, the following general principles are pertinent: the size of the contravening company; the deliberateness of the contravention and the period over which it occurred; whether the contravention arose out of the conduct of senior management in a corporation or at a lower level; whether the corporation has a culture conducive to compliance with the Act, as, for example, evidenced by educational programs and disciplinary or other corrective measures which are taken institutionally in response to an acknowledged contravention; whether the respondent, be it corporate or individual, has cooperated with the authorities responsible for the enforcement of the Act in relation to the contravention; (and this may be part of the size of the corporation, where it is a corporate respondent), the financial position of the contravener and its, his or her capacity to pay; the deterrent effect, both specific and general, of the proposed penalty; the totality principle; and parity and, I think, also relativity of penalty, with other respondents, having regard to individual circumstances of involvement in a contravention.\\n\\nThere are other statements in authorities under the Trade Practices Act which are, in my opinion, germane in relation to the imposition of penalty in respect of Spam Act prosecutions.\\n\\nThere is no evidence before me in relation to capacity to pay in respect of any of the Respondents. The Authority submits that an approach evident in Nicholson J's judgment in relation to capacity to pay in Clarity1 is apposite in the circumstances of this case. His Honour stated at para 43: \\n \\n Also I accept that the issue of capacity to pay is, although a relevant factor, of less relevance when balanced against the necessity of imposing a penalty that satisfies the objective of general deterrence.\\n\\nHis Honour then makes reference in that regard to Leahy Petroleum (No 2). Deterrent Effect of the Proposed Penalty\\n\\nI have already made reference to a particular importance in general deterrence in the imposition of penalty in respect of contraventions of this Act. It may be noted that Parliament itself has, in a sense, capped daily maximum penalties so as to avoid what one might regard as exponential and thus unrealistically large penalties for multiple contraventions. That said, Parliament has, nonetheless, provided for penalties which accrue, at least on a daily basis, which are significant penalties. In this case, the Authority seeks penalties which are not particularly large, having regard to theoretical maximums, but are large having regard to totality, but not so large as to offend that principle.\\n\\nThe totality principle requires that the total penalty for related offences ought not to exceed what is proper for the entire contravening conduct involved. So far as penalty is concerned, the Authority submits that penalties should fall within the following ranges:\\n\\nThe Authority submits that, though these penalty ranges are substantial, they do not violate the totality principle. They represent a relatively small proportion of the theoretical legislatively-derived maximum amounts in the circumstances of these contraventions. So far as the corporate Respondents are concerned, they are in the order of 5% to 7% of theoretical maximums. I agree with this particular submission so far as the application of the totality principle is concerned. Parity and Relativity\\n\\nThe proposed penalty ranges do, in my opinion, reflect appropriate parity and relativities. This might be highlighted in the following way.\\n\\nAs between Mobilegate and Winning Bid, Mobilegate's conduct covered a longer period: 331 days as opposed to 187 days. Next, as between individual Respondents, Messrs Owen and Salcedo had a higher level, and a significantly higher level, of authority in the management and control of the corporations than did Mr Maughan. Nonetheless, each of the individual Respondents was involved for over 800 individual days of contraventions. Mr Maughan's subordination is recognised by the penalty range submitted for him being in the order of 40 % to 50 % of that submitted as apt in respect of Messrs Owen and Salcedo.\",\"1\":\"These reasons for judgment should be read in conjunction with those which I delivered on 14 August 2009: see Australian Communications and Media Authority v Mobilegate Ltd A Company Incorporated in Hong Kong (No2) [2009] FCA 887.\\n\\nPursuant to the directions given on 14 August 2009, the Australian Communications and Media Authority (the Authority), as Applicant, served upon the Respondents, which and whom I have mentioned, written submissions together with affidavits to be relied upon in respect of penalty or otherwise identified affidavits in respect of which reliance was to be placed. For their part none of the named Respondents has chosen to appear today. That, of course, is their perfect right.\\n\\nOne of them, Mr Salcedo, did, though, choose to correspond with the Registry of the Court. He did this by a letter dated 28 September 2009 received by the Registry that day. That letter now forms part of exhibit 2. A subsequent exchange of correspondence occurred as between the Registry and Mr Salcedo on the subject of whether it was his intention that the letter stand as his submissions in relation to the penalty hearing.\",\"2\":\"Thus, under the Trade Practices Act , it is relevant to take into account whether the conduct that contravened the Act was systematic, deliberate or covert: see J McPhee and Son (Australia) Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2000] FCA 365 ; (2000) 172 ALR 532 at [158] . \\nIn this case, the contravening conduct might aptly be described by each of those adjectives. In other words, it was systematic, it was deliberate and, materially, covert in terms of the ability of those mobile phone users preyed upon to ascertain readily the identity of their predator if they were disposed to seek recourse to the courts to recover moneys lost. I shall elaborate a little further on that aspect in a moment.\",\"3\":\"Again, in terms of Trade Practices Act authorities, there is useful guidance on the role of both specific and general deterrence in the imposition of penalties. In Trade Practices Commission v Mobil Oil Australia Ltd [1984] FCA 363 ; (1985) 4 FCR 296 at pages 297 to 298, Toohey J, then a judge of this Court, remarked: \\n \\n The penalty should be such as to deter not only the particular offender but others who may be disposed to engage in prohibited conduct of a similar kind.\\n\\nThat, in my opinion, is a particularly weighty consideration in relation to Spam Act contraventions. This case discloses on the evidence that while it is possible for a regulatory authority, through diligent investigation, to detect not only those corporations but those individuals involved in contraventions, the task is not an easy or an inexpensive one. It consumes public resources which might otherwise usefully be deployed to other ends. That being so, penalties in respect of contraventions must be such as to deter the unscrupulous from taking a calculated business risk. In other words, in my opinion, penalties must be of such an order that having regard to particular gains which might be involved, it is in effect commercial suicide to seek those gains via contraventions of the Spam Act .\\n\\nSentiments such as these are evident in prior authority.\",\"4\":\"In NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [1996] FCA 1134 ; (1996) 71 FCR 285 at pages 294 to 295 (NW Frozen Foods), a Full Court opined: \\n \\n The court should not leave room for any impression of weakness in its resolve to impose penalties sufficient to ensure the deterrence, not only of the parties actually before it, but also of others who might be tempted to think that contravention would pay ...\",\"5\":\"To like effect is the following observation of Selway J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v McMahon Services Pty Ltd (2004) ATPR 42-031 at [15]: \\n \\n The penalty must be sufficiently high that a business, acting rationally and in its own best interest, will not be prepared to treat the risk of such a penalty as a business cost.\",\"6\":\"Of course, a penalty should not be so high as to be oppressive, but it is important in this regard to recall exactly what is meant by that sentiment. That was, with respect, aptly and accurately stated by Merkel J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Leahy Petroleum Pty Ltd (No 2) [2005] FCA 254 ; (2005) 215 ALR 281 (Leahy Petroleum (No 2)) at para 9 as follows, (and this is a reference to observations made by Smithers J in a case, Trade Practices Commission v Stihl Chain Saws (Australia) Pty Ltd (1978) ATPR 40-091 , which had been referred to by Burchett and Kiefel JJ in NW Frozen Foods): \\n \\n I therefore respectfully agree with the observation of Smithers J, referred to by Burchett and Kiefel JJ in NW Frozen Foods, to the effect that, a penalty that is of no greater than is necessary to achieve the object of general deterrence, will not be oppressive.\",\"7\":\"Of course, a penalty should not be so high as to be oppressive, but it is important in this regard to recall exactly what is meant by that sentiment. That was, with respect, aptly and accurately stated by Merkel J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Leahy Petroleum Pty Ltd (No 2) [2005] FCA 254 ; (2005) 215 ALR 281 (Leahy Petroleum (No 2)) at para 9 as follows, (and this is a reference to observations made by Smithers J in a case, Trade Practices Commission v Stihl Chain Saws (Australia) Pty Ltd (1978) ATPR 40-091 , which had been referred to by Burchett and Kiefel JJ in NW Frozen Foods): \\n \\n I therefore respectfully agree with the observation of Smithers J, referred to by Burchett and Kiefel JJ in NW Frozen Foods, to the effect that, a penalty that is of no greater than is necessary to achieve the object of general deterrence, will not be oppressive.\",\"8\":\"This is not one of those cases of the kind encountered in the State criminal courts where, by reference to a high volume of analogous criminal conduct, it is possible to set, and then for sentencing judges to have regard to, particular benchmarks derived from guidance given by a Court of Appeal. I have already referred to theoretical maximums that one might derive in respect of the corporate Respondents, and to the ability to make an estimation of theoretical maximums in respect of individuals. In Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25 ; (2005) 228 CLR 357 Gleeson CJ and Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ, in relation to maximum sentences said at [30]: \\n \\n Legislatures do not enact maximum available sentences as mere formalities. Judges need sentencing yardsticks. It is well accepted that the maximum sentence available may in some cases be a matter of great relevance. In their book Sentencing , Stockdale and Devlin observe that: \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\\"A maximum sentence fixed by parliament may have little relevance in a given case, either because it was fixed at a very high level in the last century ... or because it has more recently been set at a high catch-all level ... At other times the maximum may be highly relevant and sometimes may create real difficulties ... \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n A change in a maximum sentence by Parliament will sometimes be helpful [where it is thought that parliament regarded the previous penalties as inadequate].\\\"\\n\\nAnd then at [31]: \\n \\n It follows that careful attention to maximum penalties will almost always be required, first, because the legislature has legislated for them; secondly, because they invite comparison between the worst possible case and the case before the court at the time; and thirdly, because in that regard they do provide, taken and balanced with all the other relevant factors, a yardstick.\\n\\nI turn to look at particular factors designated in s 24 as relevant. Obviously enough, these factors are measured against the matters pleaded in the statement of claim, and the evidence upon which the Authority seeks to rely and of which notice has been given to the particular Respondents; in particular, affidavits of Mr Weber, filed on 12 May, 13 May, and 21 May 2009. Nature and Extent of Contraventions\",\"9\":\"It is relevant to note that Mr Owen was the sole director of IMP when that company was the subject of an infringement notice issued by the authority pursuant to the Spam Act . It is also relevant to note that Mr Owen was an individual respondent in proceedings in the Federal Magistrates Court against a company, Dancertext, and him: see Wood v Dancertext Pty Ltd [2007] FMCA 1410 (Dancertext). The conduct described in the reasons for judgment of Raphael FM bears particular comparison with the subject of the present proceedings. Mr Salcedo\\n\\nMr Salcedo was the manager of IMP from June 2006 to May 2007. He was the manager of Winning Bid from April 2007 and the manager of Mobilegate from August 2007 to April 2009. There is also a basis for regarding him, de facto, as a director of Mobilegate even prior to his taking up that position in April 2009.\\n\\nIn June 2006, Mr Salcedo corresponded with the Authority on behalf of IMP in relation to complaints which came to form the basis of the infringement notice to which I have referred already.\"}}"
