Another example is where the applicant for relief is seeking to restrain a public authority or officer from performing his statutory duty.\\n\\n29 The substance of the matter in issue between the ACCC and Allphones in the present case is whether Allphones should be restrained from conducting itself or from threatening to conduct itself in a particular fashion in relation to the allocation of stock being conduct which is said to be intended to bully certain franchisees into complying with Allphones' wishes and demands for the purposes of and during the negotiations and mediation spawned by the Franchising Code Notice of Dispute which it served in August 2008. Those negotiations and that mediation have commenced but have not yet concluded. They are likely to conclude before the Court can determine the ACCC's claims for final relief in the proceedings.\\n\\n30 In those circumstances, I think that the case is the kind of case which falls within the principle explained by McLelland J in Kolback 8 NSWLR 533. Accordingly, I will apply that principle.\\n\\n31 As I understand that principle, I am required to have a closer look at the applicant's case than I might otherwise be required to do when considering and determining an application for interlocutory injunction in order to come to a view as to whether the applicant's case for final relief is sufficiently strong to justify the granting of the interlocutory relief sought.\\n\\n116 Senior Counsel for Allphones submitted that his client was the victim of a series of \\\" verbals \\\". As I understood that submission, it was contended on behalf of Allphones that the entire or a substantial part of the case which the ACCC was putting depended upon evidence of conversations given by disgruntled franchisees, which was, for the most part, denied by Allphones and which could not be properly tested in an interlocutory hearing. The submission was then refined somewhat in order to invoke the principle explained by McLelland J in Kolback Securities Ltd v Epoch Mining NL (1987) 8 NSWLR 533 to which I have referred in [28] to [31] above.\\n\\n117 As I have already indicated, I propose to apply what McLelland J said in Kolback Securities Ltd v Epoch Mining NL (1987) 8 NSWLR 533.\\n\\n118 However, I do not think that a correct application of that principle requires me to discount heavily or ignore the evidence given by the deponents of the affidavits which were read by the ACCC at the hearing of the present application.\\n\\n119 The conversations to which the witnesses deposed took place in a context. To a large extent, that context was governed by the events which had occurred during the course of 2008 to which I have referred above and by the contents of the Baker email. Whilst the conversations have been denied for the most part, they are not of such a character as to lead me to conclude that the ACCC's case for final relief is a weak one.\",\"12\":\"115 It must also be remembered that, as is the case with other sections of the TPA contained in Parts IVA , IVB and V, s 51AC establishes a norm of conduct. Failure to observe that norm has consequences provided elsewhere in the Act. (See the judgment of the High Court in Master Education Services Pty Ltd v Ketchell [2008] HCA 38 ; (2008) 82 ALJR 1322 at [28] to [32] (pp 1329-1330) and the cases cited in those paragraphs).\",\"13\":\"113 There is a body of authority in this Court which establishes the following propositions:\\n \\n(a) The scope of s 51AC is wider than that of s 51AA. The meaning of unconscionable for the purposes of s 51AC is not limited to the meaning of the word according to established principles of common law and equity: per French J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v C G Berbatis Holdings Pty Ltd (No 2) [2000] FCA 2 ; (2000) 96 FCR 491 at [24] and [25] (p 503); per Sundberg J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commissioner v Simply No-Knead Franchising Pty Limited [2000] FCA 1365 ; (2000) 104 FCR 253 at [31] (p 265); per Selway J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v 4WD Systems Pty Limited (2003) 59 IPR 435 at [183] (p 487) and per Jacobson J in Pacific National (ACT) Limited v Queensland Rail (2006) 28 ATPR 46-268 (p 53,515) at [918] (p 53,527).\\n \\n(b) The ordinary or dictionary meaning of unconscionable, which involves notions of serious misconduct or something which is clearly unfair or unreasonable, is picked up by the use of the word in s 51AC. When used in that section, the expression requires that the actions of the alleged contravenor show no regard for conscience, and be irreconcilable with what is right or reasonable. Inevitably the expression imports a pejorative moral judgment: per Heerey, Drummond and Emmett JJ in Hurley v McDonalds Australia Limited (2000) 22 ATPR 41-741 (p 40,578) at [22] (p 40,585). This helpful articulation of the meaning of the word when used in s 51AC was followed by Selway J in ACCC v 4WD Systems Pty Ltd (2003) 59 IPR 435 at [183]-[185] (pp 487-488) and by Sundberg J in ACCC v Simply No-Knead Franchising Pty Limited [2000] FCA 1365 ; (2000) 104 FCR 253 at [30] (p 264); and\\n \\n(c) Normally, some moral fault or moral responsibility would be involved. This would not ordinarily be present if the critical actions are merely negligent. There would ordinarily need to be a deliberate (in the sense of intentional) act or at least a reckless act: per Selway J in ACCC v 4WD Systems Pty Ltd (2003) 59 IPR 435 at [185] (p 488).\",\"14\":\"22 In Patrick Stevedores Operations No 2 Pty Ltd v Maritime Union of Australia (No 3) [1998] HCA 30 ; (1998) 195 CLR 1 at [65] and [66] (pp 41 43), Brennan CJ and McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ, in a joint judgment, expressly adopted a passage from Spry, The Principles of Equitable Remedies (5th edn, 1997, at pp 402 403), which may be summarised as follows: \\n \\n(a) In assessing the balance of convenience in an interlocutory injunction application, the interests of the public and third persons are relevant and have more or less weight according to other material circumstances;\\n \\n(b) Whether those interests tend to favour the grant or the refusal of an injunction in any given case depends upon the circumstances of that case; and\\n \\n(c) Hardship visited upon third persons or the public generally by the grant of an interlocutory injunction will rarely be decisive.\\n\\n23 In the present case, I must assess and compare the prejudice and hardship likely to be suffered by Allphones, any relevantly affected third parties and the public generally if an injunction is granted, with that which is likely to be suffered by Allphones' franchisees who remain on the old franchise agreement, any other relevantly affected third parties and the public generally if no injunction is granted. In determining these matters, I must make an assessment of the likelihood that the final relief (if granted) will adequately compensate and protect those affected by the alleged wrongful conduct for the continuing contraventions which will have occurred between the date of the interlocutory hearing and the date when final relief might be expected to be granted.\\n\\n24 Section 80(6) of the TPA provides that, in a case such as the present, the Court shall not require the ACCC to give any undertaking as to damages.\\n\\n25 This provision puts the ACCC in a privileged position when compared with the position of ordinary litigants.\\n\\n26 In my judgment, in a case where the ACCC seeks interlocutory injunctive relief, it may be necessary to take into account the absence of an undertaking as to damages when the Court comes to determine where the balance of convenience and the balance of justice lie. The extent to which this circumstance will play a role in any particular case will be governed by all of the circumstances of the case including the nature and strength of the ACCC's case as presented at the interlocutory stage.\"}}"
