"{\"id\":{\"0\":\"c0\"},\"class\":{\"0\":\"cited\"},\"tocase\":{\"0\":\"Applicant A v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1997] HCA 4 ; (1997) 190 CLR 225\"},\"text\":{\"0\":\"5 In relation to the principal question, namely, the appellant's fear of persecution for breach of China's \\\"one-child policy\\\", the Tribunal accepted that the appellant had breached the policy, but went on to state that it was satisfied that any harm which may be suffered by the appellant was pursuant to a law of a general application. Accordingly, after referring to the principle discussed by the High Court in Applicant A v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1997] HCA 4 ; (1997) 190 CLR 225 at 233 (per Brennan CJ) and 258 (per McHugh J) that the enforcement of a generally applicable law does not ordinarily constitute persecution for the purposes of the Refugees Convention, the Tribunal in the present case formed the view that the law concerning China's \\\"one-child policy\\\" was a law of general application, and that the appellant did not have a well-founded fear of persecution arising out of the existence of that law.\\n\\n6 The appellant disputed the uniformity and generality of the application of China's \\\"one-child policy\\\" on the basis that the law was applied differently as between different ethnic groups and regions in China. However, the Tribunal accepted that the law was one of general application and reasoned that, without evidence of selectivity in its enforcement, such a law amounts to no more than a non-discriminatory law and, therefore, on the High Court authority, would not give rise to circumstances warranting the grant of a protection visa.\\n\\n7 The appellant, in his notice of appeal, raises two other grounds. The first is that he was denied natural justice because the Tribunal did not give him particulars of certain information which constituted its reason or part of its reason for affirming the decision under review. None of the brief submissions advanced in the notice of appeal make out the allegation embodied in this ground. The second ground is that the Federal Magistrate failed to find that the Tribunal erred because it asked incorrect questions. There is no substance in this ground because it is apparent on a fair reading of the Tribunal's reasons for decision that it not only asked the correct questions but also directed its attention to the crucial aspects of the appellant's claim, namely, China's \\\"one-child policy\\\" and its general application.\"}}"
