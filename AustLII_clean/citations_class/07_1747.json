The Federal Magistrate had failed to find error of law, jurisdictional error, procedural fairness and relief under s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth).\\n \\n2. The Federal Magistrate had dismissed the case without considering the legal and factual errors in the Tribunal decision.\\n \\n3. The Federal Magistrate made a legal, factual and jurisdictional error in not applying the principles laid down in Randhawa 52 FCR 437.\\n \\n4. The Federal Magistrate failed to take into consideration that the Tribunal decision was unjust and made without taking into account the full gravity of the appellant's circumstances and consequences of the claim.\\n \\n5. The Tribunal had ignored relevant material as to the appellant's Shi'a background which put his life at risk, relied in part on irrelevant material and made a finding which was erroneous or mistaken.\\n \\n6. There had been a lack of procedural fairness in his case along the same line as Muin v Refugee Review Tribunal [2002] HCA 30 ; (2002) 190 ALR 601. In particular, the appellant claimed that his case was identical to Muin [2002] HCA 30 ; 190 ALR 601, where the Tribunal had misled the applicant before it in that case to believe that the Tribunal had read some material.\\n \\n7. The Federal Magistrate did not consider the appellant's application dismissed on the date of hearing the application, and the appellant was not legally represented at the hearing before the Federal Magistrate.\\n \\n8. The Tribunal was affected by jurisdictional error in that the Tribunal did not take into account certain relevant considerations or \\\"integers\\\" central to the appellant's claim.\\n \\n9. The Tribunal failed to carry out its review function and exercise its jurisdiction in that:\\n \\n \\n \\u2022 it did not consider the immense and intimidating pressure on the appellant by Sunnis because of his Shi'a background\\n \\u2022 it did not consider the appellant's claim that Sunnis would kill him if he returned to Pakistan. \\n \\n\\n10. The Tribunal had applied the wrong test, in particular:\\n \\n \\n \\u2022 by requiring independent evidence of facts before the Tribunal would accept a claim being made by the appellant the Tribunal was, in fact, placing high onus of proof on the appellant and failing to give the appellant the benefit of the doubt\\n \\u2022 the Tribunal left out individual elements of the appellant's claims and tested whether they individually amounted to persecution rather than looking at the claim as a whole to determine whether the claim amounted to persecution.\\n\\n31 In Muin [2002] HCA 30 ; 190 ALR 601 the majority of the High Court held, inter alia , that where the Tribunal indicated to a claimant for refugee status that it had considered all material relating to his application, but in fact had not because the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs had not transferred all relevant material to the Tribunal, there was a failure in the Tribunal to accord procedural fairness to the claimant in relation to such material.\\n\\n32 With respect to the appeal before me, it is not clear as to which material the appellant is referring in relying on principles articulated in Muin [2002] HCA 30 ; 190 ALR 601.

Decisions of the Tribunal are privative clause decisions and as such are not open to review on the facts: S157\\/2002 v Commonwealth [2003] HCA 2 ; (2003) 211 CLR 476.

In any event, the Court cannot engage in review of the merits of the appellant's claims: NAHI v MIMIA [2004] FCAFC 10 at [10] .\\n Fifth ground of appeal\\n\\n35 It is clear that, notwithstanding the claim of the appellant, the Tribunal did consider his claims concerning his position arising from his Shi'a background, and the potential danger to the appellant should he return to Pakistan, and made findings adverse to the appellant with respect to these claims. As I indicated earlier in this judgment, the Court cannot engage in review of the merits of the appellant's claims: NAHI v MIMIA [2004] FCAFC 10 at [10] .\\n Tenth ground of appeal\",\"9\":\"22 A number of these grounds were not raised before Driver FM. Although as a general proposition the appellant must demonstrate that it is expedient and in the interests of justice that new grounds of appeal be raised - O'Brien v Komesaroff [1982] HCA 33 ; (1982) 150 CLR 310 at 319, Coulton v Holcombe [1986] HCA 33 ; (1986) 162 CLR 1 at 7 - I am prepared to consider them in this appeal.\",\"10\":\"13 This is clearly of concern. Failure by a court of first instance to consider a claim clearly raised by a litigant can give rise to a miscarriage of justice. So, for example, in the High Court decision QBE Insurance Ltd v Switzerland Insurance Workers Compensation (NSW) Ltd (1996) 70 ALJR 281 on appeal from the Court of Appeal of New South Wales, Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ held that, in circumstances where a ground of cross-appeal was plainly arguable, and the judgment of the court below gave no indication that it had considered that ground (and, if it did, the reasons given by the court could not be regarded as proper reasons for rejecting that ground), there had been a miscarriage of justice calling for the intervention of the High Court. In those circumstances the High Court ordered that that the matter be remitted for re-determination to the Court of Appeal.\\n\\n14 At the hearing before me, Mr Foreman submitted that, in relation to the issue of relocation as claimed by the appellant before the Federal Magistrate:\\n \\n\\u2022 the appellant had no prospect of success\\n \\n\\u2022 in any event, the issue of relocation was not relevant in the context of this appeal because the appellant had, as found by the Tribunal, actually relocated from his village over ten years ago. Accordingly this is not a case where either the Tribunal, or the Court on judicial review, is required to consider whether relocation within Pakistan is a feasible option for the appellant.\\n\\n15 In this case, I consider that this error of the Federal Magistrate is not a reason to allow the appeal from his Honour's decision or to remit the case to the Federal Magistrate for re-hearing. I take this view because I accept the submission of Mr Foreman that the appellant had no prospect of success in relation to this ground of judicial review before his Honour. To use the terminology of the High Court decision in QBE 70 ALJR 281, this ground of review was not \\\"plainly arguable\\\" in light of the findings of the Tribunal with respect to relocation of the appellant elsewhere in Pakistan.\",\"11\":\"10 The appellant has obliquely raised this issue in his third ground of appeal before me, namely that:\\n \\n \\\"The Federal Magistrate made a legal, factual and jurisdictional error in not applying the principles laid down in Randhawa v The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (1994) 52 FCR 437\\\".\\n\\n11 (The Full Court decision in Randhawa 52 FCR 437 clearly raises issues of relocation, as I outline later in this judgment.)\\n\\n12 To a lesser extent, the issue is also raised by the appellant in his second ground of appeal, namely:\\n \\n \\\"The Federal Magistrate had dismissed the case without considering the legal and factual errors in the Tribunal decision\\\".\\n\\n16 In Randhawa 52 FCR 437 the facts demonstrated that the appellant in that case, a Sikh from the Punjab region of India, would have had a well-founded fear of persecution were he required to return to his family's home in the Punjab. However the Full Court in Randhawa 52 FCR 437 held that the Convention definition of \\\"refugee\\\" does not support a claim to refugee status in circumstances where the appellant, although having a well-founded fear of persecution in one region of a country, could avail themselves of protection elsewhere within that country. This is only the case, however, if it is reasonable in the circumstances to expect a person with a well-founded fear of persecution in relation to that part of the country from which they have fled to relocate to another part of the country of nationality. If it is not reasonable, their fear of persecution in relation to the country as a whole is well-founded (per Black CJ at 440-441 and 443, Beaumont J at 451, Whitlam J at 453).\\n\\n17 The principles articulated by the Full Court in Randhawa 52 FCR 437 were recently affirmed by the High Court in SZATV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) 237 ALR 634. In that case at pages 638-639 Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ agreed with the reasoning of Lord Bingham of Cornhill in Januzi v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2006] UKHL 5 ; [2006] 2 AC 426 where his Lordship said:\\n \\n The [Convention] does not expressly address the situation at issue in these appeals where, within the country of his nationality, a person has a well-founded fear of persecution at place A, where he lived, but not at place B, where (it is said) he could reasonably be expected to relocate.

In this case, however with respect to a document purporting to be a copy of a First Information Report, referring to a crime by the appellant allegedly occurring after he had left Pakistan, and which the Tribunal concluded was not a reliable source of evidence, it is clear from the Tribunal decision that the Tribunal had questioned the appellant in relation to the document and expressed doubt at the hearing as to its provenance.
