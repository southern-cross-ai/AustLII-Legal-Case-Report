The fulfilment of the requirements in s 94(1)(b)(ii) is conditional upon the satisfaction of the CEO of Austrade, and such satisfaction is to be determined by the application of the Guidelines. Once a determination has been made that the requirements are met, s 94(2) then directs Austrade to treat the particulars of the previous owner as being those of the applicant. Such determination requires a judgment to be made by the CEO of Austrade. As was observed in Australian Postal Corporation v Forgie and Another [2003] FCAFC 223 ; (2003) 130 FCR 279 at [40] of a decision making process: ' [t] his intellectual process involves matters of judgment and degree' . That is, a decision is required.\\n\\nIn the application of both s 94(1)(b)(i) and (ii) a value judgment must be made by the decision-maker. Under s 94(1)(b)(i) a decision is required to be made in respect of the question whether the new owner is carrying on the old business or a part thereof. It follows that there has been a decision made by Austrade in respect of which an appeal may lie to this Court pursuant to s 44 of the AAT Act.\\n\\nAccordingly, the Court rejects the submission that the requirements of s 94(1) constitute jurisdictional facts, and that s 94(1)(b)(i) is capable of determination by objective facts.\",\"1\":\"In Comcare v Etheridge and Others [2006] FCAFC 27 ; (2006) 149 FCR 522 at 527 the Full Court considered the nature of an appeal under s 44(1) of the AAT Act and determined that an appeal 'on a question of law' is narrower than an appeal 'that merely involves a question of law' . The Court at 527 referred to the observations in Birdseye v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2003] FCAFC 232 ; (2003) 38 AAR 55 which expressed approval of the observation of Ryan J in Australian Telecommunications Corporation v Lambroglou (1990) 12 AAR 515 at 527 where his Honour said: \\n If the question, properly analysed, is not a question of law no amount of formulary like \\\"erred in law\\\" or \\\"was open as a matter of law\\\" can make it into a question of law.\",\"2\":\"In Comcare v Etheridge and Others [2006] FCAFC 27 ; (2006) 149 FCR 522 at 527 the Full Court considered the nature of an appeal under s 44(1) of the AAT Act and determined that an appeal 'on a question of law' is narrower than an appeal 'that merely involves a question of law' .

Generally the expression is used to identify a criterion the satisfaction of which enlivens the exercise of the statutory power or discretion in question. If the criterion be not satisfied then the decision purportedly made in exercise of the power or discretion will have been made without the necessary statutory authority required of the decision maker.\"}}"
