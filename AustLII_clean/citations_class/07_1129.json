The appellant acknowledged the obstacles that lie in the way of such an attack. It must be shown that an error has been made in the exercise of the discretion. There is a strong presumption in favour of the correctness of the decision appealed from, which must be affirmed unless the court of appeal is satisfied that it is clearly wrong: Australian Coal and Shale Employees' Federation v Commonwealth [1953] HCA 25 ; (1953) 94 CLR 621 at 627.\",\"2\":\"5 An applicant for review under s 104(2) is under no obligation to demonstrate error on the part of the Registrar, and does not need to establish that the Registrar's exercise of discretion miscarried in the sense described in House v The King [1936] HCA 40 ; (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 505: Pattison v Hadjimouratis [2006] FCAFC 153 at [153] - [154] .

It must appear that some error has been made in exercising the discretion. If the judge acts upon a wrong principle, if he allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him, if he mistakes the facts, if he does not take into account some material consideration, then his determination should be reviewed and the appellate court may exercise its own discretion in substitution for his if it has the materials for doing so.\\\"\",\"3\":\"21 In Norbis v Norbis [1986] HCA 17 ; (1986) 161 CLR 513 at 518 Mason and Deane JJ said:\\n \\n \\\"If the questions involved lend themselves to differences of opinion which, within a given range, are legitimate and reasonable answers to the questions, it would be wrong to allow a court of appeal to set aside a judgment at first instance merely because there exists just such a difference of opinion between the judges on appeal and the judge at first instance.\\\"\\n\\n28 Whether someone has behaved unreasonably in particular circumstances involves a value judgment. It is a matter about which minds may well differ. In this case the appellant's conduct in response to the request in the GSM letter was relevant to the exercise of the Magistrate's discretion. The complaint that the Magistrate \\\"relied too heavily\\\" on that letter as opposed to other material does not demonstrate error in the exercise of the discretion. It simply argues about the end result of its exercise. See the passage from Norbis quoted at [21]. Nor does it mean, as the appellant submitted, that the Magistrate \\\"thereby failed to consider properly the actions and conduct of the appellant\\\".\",\"4\":\"22 The above principles apply to an appeal against an order for costs: Queensland Wire Industries Pty Ltd v Broken Hill Proprietary Co Ltd (1987) 17 FCR 211 at 222.

Thus, the court may properly depart from the usual order as to costs when the successful party by its lax conduct effectively invites the litigation; unnecessarily protracts the proceedings; succeeds on a point not argued before a lower court; prosecutes the matter solely for the purpose of increasing the costs recoverable; or obtains relief which the unsuccessful party had already offered in settlement of the dispute.\\\"\",\"5\":\"22 The above principles apply to an appeal against an order for costs: Queensland Wire Industries Pty Ltd v Broken Hill Proprietary Co Ltd (1987) 17 FCR 211 at 222.
