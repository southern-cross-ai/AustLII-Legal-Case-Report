It seems to me that would be going too far to directly involve such possible purchasers. The notice which is going to be given to ASIC, the Australian Stock Exchange and to the persons who would have sold to those purchasers does seem to me to give a reasonable possibility of the word getting out to any purchasers substantial enough to be interested in pursuing any remedies. I referred earlier to a proviso. That proviso appears in a decision of Hely J in Re Australian Wealth Management Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 311. It gives liberty for a party, who claims to have suffered substantial injustice by reason of the orders, to apply to vary or discharge them within a limited period. That is a prudent proviso in matters dealt with ex parte and there are no other parties albeit that many of the people concerned have notice of the proceeding.\\n\\nI will simply make orders in accordance with the short minutes of order which I have initialled and placed with the papers. \\n\\n\\n I certify that the preceding twelve (12) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gyles. \\n\\n\\n Associate:\\n\\nDated: 24 August 2007\\n\\n\\n Counsel for the Plaintiffs: Mr T Bathurst QC \\n \\n Solicitor for the Plaintiffs: Allens Arthur Robinson \\n \\n Date of Hearing: 15 August 2007 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 15 August 2007 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2007\\/1316.html\",\"1\":\"The orders sought to be made will be made pursuant to s 1322(4) and therefore subsection (6) is applicable and provides a barrier to the making of orders subject to the satisfaction of the Court as to the matters there listed.
