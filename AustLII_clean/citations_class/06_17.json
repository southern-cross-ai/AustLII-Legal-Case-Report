In most applications for the removal of a liquidator it is necessary to find out the wishes of the persons really interested, in this case the creditors : In re Association of Land Financiers (1878) 10 Ch D 269. I propose here not to require that a meeting of creditors be convened for that purpose (a step that is sometimes taken before a liquidator is removed) but to request the plaintiffs to provide a copy of these reasons to the Australian Taxation Office (the Commissioner being by far the largest creditor) for the purpose of ascertaining whether it has any objection to Mr Cant remaining on as liquidator of Stafford Services. I will direct the plaintiffs to report to my associate within fourteen days the response (if any) received from the ATO. In the meantime, the orders that I will make should not be perfected. It may be necessary to recall them if the ATO takes any objection.\\n\\n19 There will be orders as follows. Upon Mr Cant undertaking to resign as the liquidator of Burns International that Dennis Turner be appointed in his place; and upon Mr Cant undertaking to resign as the liquidator of Greight that Mathew Muldoon be appointed as liquidator in his place. Mr Cant's costs and expenses will be secured. I will also direct that the costs of all parties are to come out of the funds of Greight and Stafford Services. \\n I certify that the preceding nineteen (19) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Finkelstein. \\n\\n\\n \\nAssociate:\\n\\nDated: 25 January 2006\\n\\n\\n Counsel for the Plaintiffs: R Brett QC \\nM Galvin \\n \\n Solicitor for the Plaintiffs: Mills Oakley Lawyers \\n \\n Counsel for the Defendants: J Evans \\n \\n Solicitor for the Defendants: White Cleland \\n \\n Date of Hearing: 19 January 2006 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 25 January 2006 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2006\\/17.html\",\"1\":\"9 The corporate plaintiff's proprietary interest in that part of the trust fund that remains with Greight still subsists provided, of course, that Greight is not able to show that it is a bona fide purchaser for value without notice: Chief Commissioner of Stamp Duties for New South Wales v Buckle [1998] HCA 4 ; (1998) 192 CLR 226. The probability of this defence being made out is so unlikely that it may be put to one side. On this assumption, the corporate plaintiff could obtain an order for the sale of the trust property in the hands of Greight and payment out of the proceeds of an amount sufficient to discharge the indemnity ( Swiss Bank Corporation v Lloyds Bank Ltd [1982] AC 584, 604) or if the trust property is constituted by a fund an order for the payment out of that fund ( Hewett v Court [1983] HCA 7 ; (1983) 149 CLR 639, 663). These rights, however, are rights in rem. They impose no personal obligations on the person who holds the trust assets: In re Diplock [1948] 1 Ch 465, 521; In re Bank of Credit and Commerce International S.A. (No 8) [1998] AC 214. This notwithstanding, the person with the right is often called a secured creditor. But there is no debtor.\",\"2\":\"7 In its dealings as trustee of the NP Trust, the corporate plaintiff incurred a debt of around $17 million to the Commissioner of Taxation. As a trustee it is entitled to be indemnified for that expense out of the trust fund of the NP Trust ( Octavo Investments Pty Ltd v Knight [1979] HCA 61 ; (1979) 144 CLR 360, 367) and has an equitable lien on the fund for such expense ( Jennings v Mather [1901] 1 QB 108). The equitable lien is a proprietary interest in the trust property: Octavo Investments Pty Ltd v Knight [1979] HCA 61 ; (1979) 144 CLR 360, 370. If the trust fund were in the hands of the corporate plaintiff, it could apply those funds in payment of the debt: Jennings v Mather [1901] 1 QB 108, 113-114. If necessary the trustee could sell trust property to pay out the debt: In re Blundell (1888) 40 Ch D 370, 377; (1889) 44 Ch D 1.\",\"3\":\"14 Before deciding what to do, let me make these preliminary observations. If there are, or are likely to be, disputes between companies in liquidation that are under the control of one liquidator then as a general rule different persons should be appointed as liquidator to each company: In re City and County Investment Co (Ltd) (1877) 25 WR 342; In re Britton & Millard Ltd (1957) 107 L Jo 601. This is not to say that it is inappropriate to appoint one person as liquidator of a group of companies or of companies that are closely connected: In re Western Life Assurance Society; Ex parte Willett (1870) 5 Ch App 396.

But once the likelihood of conflict becomes apparent it is necessary to take action.\",\"5\":\"3 The first question to consider is whether the plaintiffs (really only the corporate plaintiff) have standing to apply for the removal of Mr Cant. The application is made under s 503 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). That section reads: \\\"The Court may, on cause shown, remove a liquidator and appoint another liquidator.\\\" The section does not say (and none of its predecessors have said) who may make the application to remove a liquidator. That is left for the court to determine. As a matter of principle I think that any person with a real interest in the winding up of a company ( In re Rubber and Produce Investment Trust [1915] 1 Ch 382) has standing under the section. By a person with a real interest in the winding up, I mean one whose rights or interests will directly be affected by action taken by a liquidator in the course of performing his (the liquidator's) duties. If the company is solvent the persons with a real interest are the contributories. If it is insolvent they are the creditors. The Privy Council recently considered this question in Deloitte & Touche A.G. v Johnson [1999] UKPC 25 ; [1999] 1 WLR 1605 in relation to the Companies Law of the Cayman Islands which, having regard to its origins, is rather similar to the Australian statute. There joint liquidators caused the company in liquidation to bring proceedings in negligence against the company's former auditors. One of the defendants to the action applied for the removal of the joint liquidators on the ground that they had a conflict of interest. The Privy Council advised that the liquidators ought not be removed. It did so on the basis that the plaintiff did not have standing to make the application. Lord Millett, who delivered the judgment of the Privy Council, said (at 1611) that in the case before the Board \\\"[t]he only persons who could have any legitimate interest of their own in having the liquidators removed from office as liquidators are the persons entitled to participate in the ultimate distribution of the company's assets, that is to say the creditors.\\\"\",\"6\":\"9 The corporate plaintiff's proprietary interest in that part of the trust fund that remains with Greight still subsists provided, of course, that Greight is not able to show that it is a bona fide purchaser for value without notice: Chief Commissioner of Stamp Duties for New South Wales v Buckle [1998] HCA 4 ; (1998) 192 CLR 226.

The trust fund presently in its possession is not sufficient to satisfy the indemnity. Shortly before its winding up, presumably at the instigation of Cardamone, Greight paid significant sums out of the fund. One payment which possibly came out of the fund was a sum of $2.290 million paid to Stafford Services. Why the payment was made is not known. If the corporate plaintiff can establish that part of the trust fund went to Stafford Services and that Stafford Services was not a bona fide purchaser for value, then the corporate plaintiff will be entitled to recover that property from it because its proprietary interest would not have been destroyed. On the other hand, if the right has been destroyed by Greight the corporate plaintiff may have an action against Greight for damages for the destruction of its lien. See Hovey v Elliott , 118 NY 124 (1890); Hale v Omaha National Bank , 49 NY 626 (1872); 1 Jones on Lien s, SS95 (1914) in relation to an action of this kind.
