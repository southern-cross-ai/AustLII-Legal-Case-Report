As a general matter, however, hindsight arguments only highlight what is already apparent - in this case, that the Deed was not artfully drafted and cl 2.1(j) did not deal expressly with taking photographs. But I greatly doubt the Deed is properly described as ambiguous. Moreover, even if it is, in the absence of a presumption in favour of either side as to how the ambiguity should be resolved (and neither side sought to argue contra proferentem, likely because that would have required going behind the forbidden veil of the mediation: see [15] below), I do not find such hindsight arguments useful.\",\"1\":\"15 A settlement agreement is simply a species of contract, and the parties did not dispute that the proper approach to be taken in construing the terms of the Deed is an objective one based on text, purpose and context: Golf Australia Holdings Ltd v Buxton Construction Pty Ltd [2007] VSCA 200 ; Commissioner of Taxation v Hadidi [1994] FCA 1173 ; (1994) 51 FCR 453.

Indeed, as the parties acknowledged, they and the Court are precluded by statute from inquiring into what was said and done in the course of the mediation: Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) s 53B. The upshot is that, while the Court may consider extrinsic evidence to construe the Deed, it may only do so to establish the mutual understandings of the parties forming the background to the transaction, not the back-and-forth of the parties in concluding the transaction.\",\"2\":\"15 A settlement agreement is simply a species of contract, and the parties did not dispute that the proper approach to be taken in construing the terms of the Deed is an objective one based on text, purpose and context: Golf Australia Holdings Ltd v Buxton Construction Pty Ltd [2007] VSCA 200 ; Commissioner of Taxation v Hadidi [1994] FCA 1173 ; (1994) 51 FCR 453.
