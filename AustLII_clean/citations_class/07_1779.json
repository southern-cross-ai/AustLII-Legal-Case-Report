In my opinion, there are two answers to this submission. First, it is clear that the Tribunal member was in no way bound by the views of the Federal Magistrates Court. The relevant consideration was the best interests of the child, not the view of the Federal Magistrates Court as to the best interests of the child. At best, the latter was an item of evidence that may be relevant to that consideration ( Li Shi Ping v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (1994) 35 ALD 225 at 236-237). Secondly, even if the implicit view of the Federal Magistrates Court was a relevant consideration it is a consideration the Tribunal member was permitted but not bound to take into account. The Tribunal member was bound to make up his own mind about the best interests of Jedi having regard to the matters in the direction and his inquiry involved an examination of the range of matters referred to in the direction.\\n\\n44 For these reasons, I reject the applicant's first submission.\\n\\n45 The applicant also referred to the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility introduced by the Family Law Amendment (Shared Parental Responsibility) Act 2006 (Cth). He referred to ss 61DA and 61DB which are in the following terms:\\n \\n 61DA Presumption of equal shared parental responsibility when making parenting orders \\n \\n \\n (1) When making a parenting order in relation to a child, the court must apply a presumption that it is in the best interests of the child for the child's parents to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Note: The presumption provided for in this subsection is a presumption that relates solely to the allocation of parental responsibility for a child as defined in section 61B. It does not provide for a presumption about the amount of time the child spends with each of the parents (this issue is dealt with in section 65DAA). \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n (2) The presumption does not apply if there are reasonable grounds to believe that a parent of the child (or a person who lives with a parent of the child) has engaged in: \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n (a) abuse of the child or another child who, at the time, was a member of the parent's family (or that other person's family); or\\n (b) family violence. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n (3) When the court is making an interim order, the presumption applies unless the court considers that it would not be appropriate in the circumstances for the presumption to be applied when making that order.\\n (4) The presumption may be rebutted by evidence that satisfies the court that it would not be in the best interests of the child for the child's parents to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child.\\n \\n \\n \\n 61DB Application of presumption of equal shared parental responsibility after interim parenting order made \\n \\n \\n If there is an interim parenting order in relation to a child, the court must, in making a final parenting order in relation to the child, disregard the allocation of parental responsibility made in the interim order.\",\"1\":\"47 The applicant's submission that the Tribunal member misunderstood the nature of the discretion in s 501(2) of the Act must be rejected. It is true that he did appear to misstate the nature of the discretion in that part of his reasons which I have summarised above ([29]) but his reasons must be read as a whole and not with an eye keenly attuned to error: Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 271-272. The Tribunal member was clearly alert to the nature of the discretion he was called upon to exercise. At the beginning of his reasons he said the only issue before him was whether the discretion to cancel the visa should be exercised and he concluded his reasons by saying that he had decided that it was appropriate to exercise the discretion under s 501(2) of the Act to cancel the applicant's visa. Furthermore, throughout his reasons, and, in particular when addressing the three primary considerations, the Tribunal member referred to a particular factor as one favouring a decision to cancel the applicant's visa.\\n\\n48 I do not think that the Tribunal member misunderstood the nature of the discretion.\\n\\n49 The applicant submits that in his analysis of other relevant considerations, the Tribunal member should have, but did not take into account the following:\\n \\n 1. Articles 23 and 24 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (New York, 16 th December 1966) Australian Treaty Series 1980 No 23 and Articles 5, 9 and 10 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (New York) 20 November 1989 Australian Treaty Series 1991 No 4;\\n 2. The hardship which would be suffered by the applicant if he was to lose contact with his son; and\\n 3. The fact that the applicant was not warned that if he committed serious offences he may jeopardise his visa.\",\"2\":\"\",\"3\":\"24 The Tribunal member commenced his examination of the third primary consideration by summarising the relevant paragraphs in the direction. He noted that the applicant's submissions focused on the best interests of his son, Jedi. At the time of the hearing before the Tribunal, he was 16 months old. The applicant submitted that he was being denied access to his son, and that if his visa was cancelled, there would be virtually no way in which future access or contact could be made. The applicant gave evidence that he wanted to remain in Australia so that he could form a meaningful relationship with his son. He submitted that his son would be disadvantaged if he grew up without a father. He referred to the evidence of Mr Tuddenham and he submitted that he was African American and that it was his desire to share his cultural background with his son. The Tribunal member referred to certain observations of Gray J in Rocca v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2005) 87 ALD 529. The Tribunal member then said:\\n \\n The applicant referred to the fact that Ms Fraser had consented to the contact orders for Jedi made in the Federal Magistrates Court. The Tribunal draws no adverse inferences from the fact that Ms Fraser so consented. Nor does the Tribunal accept the applicant's submission that, by granting the contact orders by consent, the Court was articulating that the best interests of the child would be served by allowing him to have contact with his father.\\n\\n25 The orders referred to in the above passage were orders made by the Federal Magistrates Court on 29 May 2006 and 25 September 2006 respectively. The orders made on 29 May 2006 were interim orders made by consent and until final order. The orders made on 25 September 2006 were final orders. The orders deal with the relationship between Jedi and each of his parents, namely, the applicant and Ms Fraser. The orders are set out below [32]-[33].\\n\\n26 The Tribunal member then referred to the evidence of Mr Tuddenham and the evidence of Mr Courtney. In relation to the evidence of Mr Tuddenham, he said that Mr Tuddenham did not bring any formal qualification to the hearing of the matter and he concluded that his views did not greatly assist him. In relation to Mr Courtney, he found him to be \\\"a most unimpressive witness\\\".\"}}"
