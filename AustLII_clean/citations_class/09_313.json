As Gyles J observed in GenRx Pty Limited v Sanofi Aventis [2007] FCA 1485 ; (2007) 73 IPR 502 at [15] . \\n A new entrant ... would have an effect which may be both unpredictable and irreversible.\\n\\nThe question which arises in all these circumstances is whether damages would be an adequate remedy. Wyeth submitted that any doubts which may exist in its ability to recover its losses at a final hearing point toward an order being made in the interests of justice for identity discovery at the earliest possible date.\",\"1\":\"It seems to me to follow that the Court should approach an application along the same lines as that which applies to a claim for interlocutory injunctive relief. Whilst an applicant under O 15A is not required to establish a serious question to be tried, the applicant's prospects of success are not to be considered in isolation from the element of the interests of justice. The strength or otherwise of the prospects will bear upon the question of where the interests of justice lie: Hexal Australia Pty Limited v Roche Therapeutics Inc (2005) 66 IPR 325 at [18].\",\"2\":\"The considerations which are to inform the exercise of the discretion were stated by a Full Court in Hooper v Kirella Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1584 ; (1999) 96 FCR 1. See also Apache Northwest Pty Ltd v Newcrest Mining Ltd [2009] FCAFC 39 in relation to the principles applicable under O 15A r 6.\\n\\nTwo of the considerations referred to in Hooper are critical to the determination of the present application. The first is that, although an applicant is not required to demonstrate the existence of a prima facie case against the prospective respondent, the power conferred by \\nO 15A r 3 is not to be exercised in favour of a person who intends to commence \\\"merely speculative proceedings\\\". The prospects of success are a material factor in the exercise of the discretion: Hooper at [33].\\n\\nThe second consideration is that an applicant must show that the order is necessary in the interests of justice. Their Honours said that this means that an applicant must show that the making of the order is necessary to provide that person with an effective remedy in respect of the actionable wrong of which he or she complains: Hooper at [34]. The jurisdictional facts\\n\\nThere was substantial argument between the parties as to whether two of the necessary jurisdictional facts were established. The first was whether Wyeth had made reasonable inquiries. The second was whether the \\\"proceeding\\\" to which O 15A r 3 refers is final or interlocutory, it being contended by the Department that Wyeth's purpose is to commence a proceeding for interlocutory relief, which is not contemplated by the Rule.\\n\\nThese issues can be disposed of quite briefly. There was some force in Mr Howe's submission that Wyeth has not adduced any evidence of inquiries made overseas as to the identities of the sponsors. Wyeth acknowledged that TGA applications are often preceded by similar applications made in other jurisdictions. Nevertheless, I am prepared to proceed on the basis that inquiries in those jurisdictions would not be conclusive.\\n\\nThe test stated in Hooper does not expressly stipulate any threshold which an applicant must satisfy for the exercise of the power. But in stating that a material factor in the exercise of the discretion is the prospect of success in the proceedings, the Full Court in Hooper specified, as one of the elements of the claim for identity discovery, that an applicant provide evidence in support of its claim for final relief.\\n\\nIn my view the decision in Viskase does not establish a gloss on the principles stated in Hooper . Whilst good cause must be shown, each case must turn on its own facts and the prospects of success are to be weighed in the balance of the interests of justice. Wyeth's evidence as to prospects of success\",\"3\":\"The observations of Jessup J in Interpharma Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Patents [2008] FCA 1498 at [71] [73] recognise the difficulties which may arise in restoring a patentee to the position it occupies as the only supplier of the product in the event that the patent holder succeeds at the final hearing but is denied interlocutory relief.\\n\\nNevertheless, I have come to the view that it is not in the interests of justice to order identity discovery on this application. There are two reasons for this.\\n\\nFirst, I am not satisfied on the evidence before me that Wyeth has good prospects of success at a final hearing. The most that can be said is that it has a provisional working hypothesis which would need to be supplemented by further evidence, including expert evidence, to determine the strength of Wyeth's case.\",\"4\":\"Senior counsel for the Department placed considerable emphasis upon the decision of French J in Viskase Corporation v Cryovac Inc [2000] FCA 1695. There, his Honour was dealing with an application for information discovery under O 15A r 6. He said at [24] that the rule should not be permitted to authorise information discovery except for good cause shown in terms of the conditions. He continued:- \\n In respect of patents for inventions, the exercise of the discretion must have regard both to the intrusive nature of the order and the need to encourage research and development unhampered by the prospect of speculative review of working papers by competitors. To allow the remedy in this case based upon formulaic recitations of wide application would set the threshold for pre-action discovery so low that there would be few cases in which a person wishing to challenge a patent could not obtain discovery of the kind which is sought here.\\n\\nHowever, these remarks are to be read in their context. His Honour expressed the view at [23] that the evidence which was required to satisfy the first element of O 15A r 6, namely reasonable cause to believe that an applicant has the right to obtain relief against the prospective respondent, was an opinion expressed as a conclusion stated in terms of the rule. His Honour considered that the conclusionary statement was insufficient to meet the requirements of O 15A r 6(a).\\n\\nI do not think it follows that his Honour's observations establish that a high threshold must be satisfied before an order will be made under O 15A r 3. It is true that French J said at [24] that if an order were made in that case it would establish a very low threshold for the application of the rule. But, in my opinion, that was because of the slender basis of the evidence in support of the \\\"reasonable cause to believe\\\".\\n\\nIn my view the decision in Viskase does not establish a gloss on the principles stated in Hooper . Whilst good cause must be shown, each case must turn on its own facts and the prospects of success are to be weighed in the balance of the interests of justice.
