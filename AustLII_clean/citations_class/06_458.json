The provision is of a procedural rather than substantive nature. In Rodway v The Queen [1990] HCA 19 ; (1990) 169 CLR 515 the High Court was concerned with the appellant's convictions for certain sexual offences. At the time of the alleged offences the Criminal Code (Tas) required corroboration of the evidence of the complainant but by the time of the trial that requirement had been repealed. The High Court upheld the ruling of the trial judge (Neasey J) and the Court of Criminal Appeal that the repealed provision did not apply. After citing the statement of Dixon CJ in Maxwell v Murphy [1957] HCA 7 ; (1957) 96 CLR 261 at 267, Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ said at 521:\\n \\n 'But ordinarily an amendment to the practice and procedure of a court, including the admissibility of evidence and the effect to be given to evidence, will not operate retrospectively so as to impair any existing right.

The substantive rights of Ms Duncan which came into existence in October 2005, eg her right to damages for any breach of contract, have not been affected.

In par 6 a number of terms of the Contract are pleaded, including: \\n \\n \\\"(d) That in the event of a grievance, a grievance procedure set forth in a document entitled Grievance Policy would be followed. The Grievance Policy formed part of the Contract of Employment and provided, inter alia : \\n \\n \\n (i) That the grievances should be, if possible, resolved informally with respect for other employees being maintained at all times; \\n (ii) Confidentiality would be maintained at all times and formal and informal discussions with respect to the employee would be conducted in strict confidence; \\n (iii) Disclosure information relating to the grievance would be limited to those people legitimately involved in the process, namely the Complainant and the Respondent or its Delegate: \\n (iv) If the grievance could not be resolved on an informal level a moderator would be involved and where appropriate such moderator would be drawn from the Lipscombe Child Care Service Board of Directors: \\n (v) At the conclusion of the formal grievance procedure, the processes and outcomes would be recorded in separate and confidential grievance files.\\\"\",\"3\":\"8 In my opinion, s 31A applies to the present strikeout application.

In Concrete Constructions (NSW) Pty Ltd v Nelson [1990] HCA 17 ; (1990) 169 CLR 594 a worker was injured as a result of his foreman wrongly telling him that grates in an air-conditioning shaft were secured by bolts. He brought a s 52 claim based on misleading and deceptive conduct by the foreman, for which the employer was vicariously liable. In the view of the majority (Mason CJ, Dawson, Deane and Gaudron JJ) at 604-605, the foreman's statement was not made in the course of, or for the purposes of, some trading or commercial dealing between the corporation and the particular employee.
