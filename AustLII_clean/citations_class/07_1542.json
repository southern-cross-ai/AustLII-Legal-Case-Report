In Hamod v New South Wales (2002) 188 ALR 659, Gray J (with whom the other members of the Full Court agreed) stated (at [20]) that indemnity costs served the purpose of compensating a party fully for costs incurred where the Court is of the view that it was \\\"unreasonable for the party against whom the order is made to have subjected the innocent party to the exposure of costs\\\".\\n\\n5 The Administrators submit that it was unreasonable for the DCT to have subjected them to the cost of a five day hearing and to have persisted to the end in a wide ranging attack on the conduct, and, consequently, the professional standing, of Mr Hamilton, when:\\n \\n \\u2022 as early as in the Report (dated 25 January 2006) and the Supplementary Report (dated 8 February 2006), Mr Hamilton explained that any question of any recoveries by a liquidator for the benefit of unsecured creditors was very doubtful;\\n \\u2022 any attempt to recover monies from third parties would require the funding of investigations, public examinations and recovery proceedings;\\n \\u2022 I was disposed not to set aside the DOCA primarily because of the absence of evidence or an undertaking to the Court by the DCT that she would fund investigations and public examinations, and, if recommended, recovery proceedings;\\n \\u2022 in these circumstances a winding up would serve no useful purpose (see earlier Reasons at [261]).\\n\\n6 In the earlier Reasons (at [172] [190]) I accepted the Administrators' submission that the DOCA terminated on 21 June 2006. The Administrators submit that the DCT was put on notice of their contention that the DOCA had so terminated on or about 28 June 2006, yet persisted with the proceedings even though, according to their submission, a winding up application by the DCT was bound to fail because upon the termination of the DOCA the DCT had lost the status of a creditor of Wellnora (see s 459P(1)(b) of the Act).\",\"1\":\"3 The Administrators have made helpful written submissions in support of their application for indemnity costs. There is no dispute in relation to the governing principles. The categories of case in which the discretion to award costs on the indemnity basis may be properly exercised are not closed, and an order is not compelled by the mere fact that the circumstances fit within a literal description that has been given of the features of an earlier case in which indemnity costs were ordered: NMFM Property Pty Ltd v Citibank Ltd (No 2) [2001] FCA 480 ; (2000) 109 FCR 77 at 92 [53] .\"}}"
