The Court finds that the Tribunal should have been constituted differently for determination of the second review.\\n\\n39 For the above reasons the Court grants leave to the appellant to rely upon the Amended Notice of Appeal and allows the appeal, noting that there was no error by Scarlett FM in respect of the matters raised before him.\\n I certify that the preceding thirty-nine (39) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Cowdroy. \\n\\n Associate:\\nDated: 10 July 2007\\n Counsel for the Appellant: M.D. Seymour \\n \\n Counsel for the Respondent: V.

This principle, which has evolved from the fundamental rule of natural justice that a judicial officer should be free of bias, reflects a concern with the need to maintain public confidence in the administration of justice. This concern is expressed in the cognate principle that, not only must justice be done, it must be seen to be done.' \\n\\nThis principle has been repeatedly followed: see for example Re Polites: Ex parte Hoyts Corporation Pty Ltd (No 2) [1991] HCA 31 ; (1991) 173 CLR 78 at 85 and Re Finance Sector Union of Australia; Ex parte Illaton Pty Ltd (1992) 6 ALJR 583.

Vakauta and Grassy restate the importance attached to this abiding value of our legal system.'\\n\\n30 The Full Court's decision in NAHD 214 ALR at [21] succinctly states the relevant principles as follows:\\n \\n 'The enquiry is not directed to the personal thought processes of the decision- maker. It is directed to his or her conduct \\\"objectified\\\" through the prism of what a fair minded and informed observer would reasonably apprehend...It goes without saying that a conclusion, from all the materials, including the decision and the reasons for decision, that a fair minded informed observer would reasonably apprehend a lack of impartiality in the sense discussed, does not carry with it the conclusion that there was a lack of impartiality.'\",\"19\":\"16 Only where it is expedient and in the interests of justice to do so will leave be granted to argue a ground of appeal abandoned in a lower court: see O'Brien v Komesaroff [1982] HCA 33 ; (1982) 150 CLR 310 at [319] ; Coulton v Holcombe [1986] HCA 33 ; (1986) 162 CLR 1 at [7] .

Where however there is no adequate explanation for the failure to take the point, and it seems to be of doubtful merit, leave should generally be refused.' \\n\\nThis principle has been followed more recently in SZFIR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 424 and SZEPN v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 886.\\n\\n17 In NAJT 147 FCR [166] Madgwick J identified relevant considerations in the exercise of the Court's discretion to grant leave to rely on new grounds. Such considerations include the prospects of success of the new grounds; whether an acceptable explanation has been provided as to why they were not raised in the Court below; whether it would be efficient to hear the new grounds; the interests of the appellant; the precedent value of any consideration of the issues; whether there is any prejudice to the respondents and whether any such prejudice can be remedied; and where in all the circumstances do the interests of justice lie.\\n\\n19 The Court pays regard to the following considerations. First, while no explanation has been provided for the abandonment of the ground of apprehension of bias by counsel in the proceedings before Scarlett FM, the Minister has not claimed that any significant prejudice would result if leave is granted. This ground was raised by the appellant in his original application for review of the Tribunal's second decision and the Minister had prepared and filed a response to that ground in the Federal Magistrates Court. As noted by Madgwick J in NAJT 147 FCR [172], the Minister in migration appeals is not in the position of a personal litigant and does not bear the financial risks and strains of personal involvement in litigation.\\n\\n20 Secondly the principle of the need for finality of litigation has not been adversely affected. The appellant has conducted the proceedings within the strict time limits imposed by the Act and this matter has proceeded to appeal without delay. The appellant's application for leave to amend the Notice of Appeal has not used more of the Court's resources than is usual in matters of this nature.\",\"20\":\"16 Only where it is expedient and in the interests of justice to do so will leave be granted to argue a ground of appeal abandoned in a lower court: see O'Brien v Komesaroff [1982] HCA 33 ; (1982) 150 CLR 310 at [319] ; Coulton v Holcombe [1986] HCA 33 ; (1986) 162 CLR 1 at [7] .

In NAJT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 134 ; (2005) 147 FCR 51 at [163] Madgwick J adopted the approach taken by Kiefel, Weinberg and Stone JJ in VUAX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 158 at [48] where their Honours said:\\n \\n 'The Court may grant leave if some point that was not taken below, but which clearly has merit, is advanced, and there is no real prejudice to the respondent in permitting it to be agitated. Where however there is no adequate explanation for the failure to take the point, and it seems to be of doubtful merit, leave should generally be refused.' \\n\\nThis principle has been followed more recently in SZFIR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 424 and SZEPN v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 886.\",\"33\":\"33 In Vakauta v Kelly [1989] HCA 44 ; (1989) 167 CLR 568 at 587 Toohey J said:\\n \\n 'There is no reason why, in authority or in principle, a litigant who is fully aware of the circumstances from which ostensible bias might be inferred, should not be capable of waiving the right later to object to the judge continuing to hear and dispose of the case'. \\n\\nHowever the person making the waiver must have a full appreciation of his or her action. In Vyvyan v Vyvyan (1861) 30 Beav 65 at 74; 54 ER 813 at 817 the Court stated:\\n \\n 'Waiver or acquiescence, like election, presupposes that the person to be bound is fully cognizant of his rights, and that being so, he neglects to enforce them, or chooses one benefit instead of another, either, but not both, of which he might claim.'\",\"34\":\"36 Although there is no evidence that the withdrawal of the apprehended bias claim before Scarlett FM resulted from legal advice, the Court is prepared to adopt the reasoning of the Full Court in White v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 232 ; (2000) 96 FCR 511 at [35] where the Court said:\\n \\n 'We would not consider it appropriate, or just, in the particular circumstances of this case, to fix the appellant with the consequences of what seems to us to have been an error of judgment by his former counsel in abandoning a point which had originally been taken, and which was plainly viable. It would be wrong to permit the Minister's decision to deport the appellant to stand if evidence exists which demonstrates that decision to have been affected or induced by actual bias.'\"}}"
