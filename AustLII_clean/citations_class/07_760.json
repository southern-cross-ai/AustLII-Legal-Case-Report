It is conceded that the Tribunal raised with the appellant the issue to the effect that he was of no adverse interest to the Maoists because his wife had not been seriously harmed.\",\"1\":\"33 Even if it be accepted that there is implicit in the finding set out above an acceptance that the Maoists had the capacity to kill him, unless that can be identified as a \\\"jurisdictional fact\\\", there is no error of law, let alone a jurisdictional error, in the Tribunal accepting that proposition. It is no error of law in making a wrong finding of fact: Attorney-General (NSW) v Quinn [1990] HCA 21 ; (1990) 170 CLR 1 at [35-36] .\\n\\n34 For the above reasons, in my opinion, the Court should give leave to the appellant to argue the three grounds which were sought to be relied on by him. However, for those reasons, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n I certify that the preceding thirty-four (34) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Acting Chief Justice Spender. \\n\\n Associate:\\n\\nDated: 18 May 2007\\n\\n\\n Counsel for the Appellant: L.J.
