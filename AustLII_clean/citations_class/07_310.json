Orders were also sought against officers and former officers of those companies. On 20 April 2006 receivers were appointed to the property of each of the defendants save for the seventh defendant, Bowesco Pty Ltd (Bowesco), which already had a private receivership in place. In the case of Bowesco freezing orders were made in relation to its property: Australian Securities & Investments Commission; In the matter of Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd (ACN 099 071 968) v Carey (No 3) [2006] FCA 433.\\n\\nIt is not necessary now to recite the matters which led to the making of those orders. They are set out in the reasons for judgment. Nor is it necessary to recite the convoluted history of the interlocutory processes associated with these proceedings, which are in themselves interlocutory in substance, albeit not in form. For the most part that history appears from a series of judgments delivered since 20 April 2006.\\n\\nOn 7 August 2006 ex parte orders were made joining Rold Corporation Pty Ltd (Rold) as the eleventh defendant. Interim asset preservation orders were made in relation to the property of Rold and remain in place until today.\",\"1\":\"As a reading of s 1323 demonstrates, it does not provide for a general freezing order of the kind sought by ASIC as its primary relief. Even the interim orders for which s 1323(3) provides are limited to orders of the kind applied for under subs (1). The absence of power under s 1323 to make mareva type orders against \\\"the relevant person\\\" in respect of property held by that person was noted by Finkelstein J in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Wiggins (1998) 90 FCR 314 at 319. That is not to say that a more general mareva type order may not be made on an interlocutory basis pending the determination of a substantive application under s 1323. Such an order, as an interlocutory order, would be authorised by s 23. Finkelstein J was not in doubt that he had the power to make an order of the kind sought by ASIC \\\"but it would not be an order in pursuance of the powers conferred by s 1323\\\" (at 320).\\n\\nCounsel for ASIC acknowledged the absence of power, under s 1323, to grant a mareva type order in relation to the assets of a company or individual. He relied upon s 23 of the Federal Court Act as the primary source of power for the orders which ASIC seeks. In my opinion, however, this is not an appropriate application of s 23. It is not open to ASIC to file an application for freezing orders in proceedings under s 1323 then effectively ignore s 1323 and say it is relying upon s 23 of the Federal Court Act. The question about the way in which s 23 could be invoked in an application under s 1323 was raised by the Court in argument. Subsequently, both parties were given time to file written submissions on the point which they have done and which have been considered.\",\"2\":\"The jurisdiction which the Court exercises when it entertains an application under s 1323 is a jurisdiction defined in part by the remedies available under that section.

The question about the availability of relief under s 23 is analogous to the much debated question whether the High Court, in an application for mandamus or prohibition or an injunction under s 75(v) of the Constitution , has power to award certiorari in addition to, or in lieu of, those remedies. In the case of the Federal Court the source of that power in aid of jurisdiction under s 39B(1) would be s 23.

The High Court held, inter alia, that such an order was appropriate where the third party might be subject to some court process whereby, whether following the appointment of a liquidator or otherwise, the third party may be obliged to disgorge property. In their discussion of s 23 , Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Callinan JJ made the point that the section does not authorise the court to grant injunctive relief where jurisdiction is acquired under another statute which provides an exhaustive code of available remedies and that code does not authorise the grant of an injunction (at [33]). They referred in this connection to Byrne v Australian Airlines Ltd [1995] HCA 24 ; (1995) 185 CLR 410 at 425-426 and Patrick Stevedores Operations No 2 Pty Ltd v Maritime Union of Australia [1998] HCA 30 ; (1998) 195 CLR 1 at 29.\\n\\nConsistent with the approach which appears to have been adopted by the High Court in the s 75(v) cases, and bearing in mind what was said in Cardile [1999] HCA 18 ; 198 CLR 380 , I accept that where, in an application under s 1323, the grounds for the appointment of receivers are made out, then a lesser order restricting or prohibiting dealings with the relevant property may be made instead. While s 1323 sets out the specific orders which may be made on an application brought under it, it does not, in my opinion, provide an exhaustive code of remedies to the extent that the power to appoint receivers excludes the lesser alternative of orders restricting or prohibiting dealings with the subject property. It may be, for example, that the appointment of receivers would be necessary or desirable to protect the interests of a potential claimant against the property of the company or individual to which the receivers are to be appointed. At the same time, such an appointment might inflict significant damage on an ongoing business which is detrimental to that business and perhaps also to third parties. In that event a lesser order freezing or limiting dealings with the subject property could be regarded as an exercise of the power under s 23.\\n\\nContrary, therefore, to the first submission put by ASIC, the application under which such orders can be made is not to be characterised as one \\\"primarily made pursuant to section 23 of the Federal Court Act \\\". Section 23 does not confer jurisdiction. It confers powers on the Court to make orders in the exercise of the Court's jurisdiction. The sources of jurisdiction are to be found elsewhere. Jurisdiction under the Corporations Act is conferred on the Federal Court by s 1337B(1) and, for the purposes of this proceeding, defined by s 1323.\\n\\nIt is open to the Court under s 1323(1)(h) to appoint receivers with powers defined according to the circumstances of the case. Such receiverships might be characterised as restrictive or light according to the nature of the powers and the range of dealings with the affected property permitted by the order. However it must be recognised that even though a receiver may be appointed with limited powers allowing for ongoing dealings in the ordinary course of business, the fact that a receiver has been appointed may trigger default provisions in security documents or otherwise cause practical difficulties with customers, contractors, suppliers and financiers dealing with an ongoing business.\",\"10\":\"In Cardile v LED Builders Pty Ltd [1999] HCA 18 ; (1999) 198 CLR 380 the question arose whether s 23 would authorise a mareva type order against persons not party to the proceedings in which it was sought.

In my opinion ASIC has not made out a case that it is either necessary or desirable that receivers be appointed to the property of Rold. The party for whom protection is sought is the liquidator. The liquidator can bring his claim and apply for any necessary interlocutory relief if he considers that the asset which he claims is at risk. He can do so with an appropriate undertaking as to damages which is not offered by ASIC. For final relief under s 1323 no such undertaking is required even though it maybe time limited. In respect of interim relief under s 1323(3), no such undertaking is required see s 1323(4). The primary \\\"risk\\\" which may confront the liquidator appears to be that of payment of a substantial amount of the relevant fund to the Commissioner of Taxation in satisfaction of a liability for capital gains tax. The requirement to make such a payment is not likely to arise for another three months.\\n\\nThe history of the relationship between Allan Carey and his brother and their prior dealings gives rise, at worst, to a very small and, in my opinion, much diminished risk, that Norman Carey might influence Allan Carey to deal with Rold assets for his benefit or that of entities associated with him. I do not consider that risk of such a magnitude as to warrant the appointment of receivers under s 1323, nor the making of orders under s 23 of the Federal Court Act .\\n\\nFor the preceding reasons the application will be dismissed. I should add that, in my opinion, it is desirable that consideration be given to an amendment to s 1323 to include a power in the Court to make orders restricting or prohibiting dealings with the property of the \\\"relevant person\\\". This would allow more flexibility in the making of such orders than is possible by invoking s 23 in aid of the jurisdiction defined by s 1323. \\n I certify that the preceding forty-five (45) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice French. \\n \\n Associate:\\nDated: 8 March 2007\\n \\n Counsel for the Plaintiff Mr S Owen-Conway QC and Mr N Gvozdin \\n \\n Solicitor for the Plaintiff: Australian Government Solicitor \\n \\n Counsel for the Eleventh Defendant: Mr PP McQuade \\n \\n Solicitor for the Eleventh Defendant: McCullough Robertson \\n \\n Date of Hearing:\\nDates of Further Written Submissions: 26 February 2007\\n5 and 6 March 2007 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 8 March 2007 \\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2007\\/310.html\"}}"
