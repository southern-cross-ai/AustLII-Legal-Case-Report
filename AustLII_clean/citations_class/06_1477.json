In NBAJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FMCA 1668 , Barnes FM at 33, adopting the observations of Lord Bridge in Regina v Home Secretary; Ex parte Al-Mehdawi (1990) 1 AC 876 at 898, rejected the submission that fraud by an agent constituted jurisdictional error. In SZBSZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 779 Bennett J considered the circumstance in which an applicant claimed his migration agent had acted without consultation or instructions and in consequence an invitation to attend a Tribunal hearing was declined. Her Honour concluded that since the Tribunal's letter was forwarded in accordance with the relevant statutory requirements, there was no failure to give the applicant the opportunity to appear before the Tribunal, even though the applicant claimed that he had never received it. Accordingly the Tribunal was entitled to make a decision on the application for review in the absence of the applicant. The same conclusions were made in Applicant M172 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FMCA 23. In SZBBL v Minister for Immigration [2004] FMCA 185 , Driver FM rejected the submission that there had been a denial of natural justice because of default on the part of the migration agent. His Honour's decision was upheld on appeal in this Court by Tamberlin J: see SZBBL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 834.\",\"1\":\"25 In SZFDE the majority found that the legislative scheme contained in Div 4 of the Act required an invitation to be given to the appellant. Such invitation had been provided, and the decision not to attend resulted from the dishonest conduct of the agent. However, such conduct did not corrupt the decision or the statutory process. The majority considered that authorities which have upheld challenges to orders made against a party by a court in their absence through no fault of their own, such as Taylor v Taylor [1979] HCA 38 ; (1979) 143 CLR 1 and Cameron v Cole [1944] HCA 5 ; (1944) 68 CLR 571, are distinguishable because of the absence of the statutory scheme provided by the Act.\",\"2\":\"18 The sole basis for the assertion that there has been procedural error arises in consequence of the alleged fraudulent conduct by the appellant's nominated agent arising from his advice to the appellant that he would attend the hearing on his behalf and that it was not necessary for the appellant to attend. The appellant claims that there was a failure to comply with s 425 of the Act because he was not provided with a ' real and meaningful invitation ', as considered in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SCAR [2003] FCAFC 126 ; (2003) 128 FCR 553 at [37] , because of the conduct of the migration agent.\\n\\n26 In SCAR the Full Court recognised that under certain circumstances the invitation process prescribed by s 425 of the Act may not have been fulfilled (see also SZFML ). However, in SCAR the Full Court found that the Tribunal innocently provided unfair treatment to the appellant in circumstances where the appellant was ill. In Tobasi v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCA 1050 ; (2002) 122 FCR 322, the Tribunal provided a translator who was unable to speak the appellant's language. In VBAB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 804 ; (2002) 121 FCR 100, the appellant was misled by statements of the Tribunal. In Applicant NAHF of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2003) FCR 359, the Tribunal declined to grant an adjournment of the hearing, knowing that the appellant was incapacitated. Although the requirement of s 425 had been followed, the invitation was held to be 'an empty gesture and a denial of procedural fairness'(see Hely J at 366 [36]).\",\"3\":\"24 Even if the appellant established fraud, in the sense of reckless conduct or dishonesty by his migration agent which resulted in a non-attendance at a hearing of the Tribunal, the decision of the Tribunal is not vitiated: see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v SZFDE [2006] FCAFC 142 in which Allsop J said at [136]:\\n \\n 'The parties did not attend a hearing to which they were invited, on the facts, because of the dishonest advice of their own agent. The decision itself was made, without the benefit of the participation of the respondents, but unaffected, and certainly not induced, by fraud.' \\n\\nHis Honour also said at [139]:\\n \\n 'There has been no fraud of the Tribunal. There has been no fraud of the executive department. There was an invitation to attend a hearing. That invitation was declined. That decision to decline the invitation was influenced by the dishonesty and fraudulent purpose of the agent of the applicants. I do not see the basis for a conclusion that there was any denial of procedural fairness or that those circumstance [sic] denied the Tribunal the authority to decide the review given the terms of ss 425, 426A and s 422B.'\\n\\n25 In SZFDE the majority found that the legislative scheme contained in Div 4 of the Act required an invitation to be given to the appellant. Such invitation had been provided, and the decision not to attend resulted from the dishonest conduct of the agent. However, such conduct did not corrupt the decision or the statutory process. The majority considered that authorities which have upheld challenges to orders made against a party by a court in their absence through no fault of their own, such as Taylor v Taylor [1979] HCA 38 ; (1979) 143 CLR 1 and Cameron v Cole [1944] HCA 5 ; (1944) 68 CLR 571, are distinguishable because of the absence of the statutory scheme provided by the Act.\\n\\n28 In SZFDE French J dissented, finding that the fraud did affect the decision because it resulted in the non-appearance of the appellant before the Tribunal. As a consequence the Tribunal was deprived of the opportunity of exploring certain issues with the appellant. French J concluded that the Tribunal's decision ' was not one made under the Act, and therefore not a privative clause decision protected by s 474 '. French J's decision recognises the possibility that where, through no fault of their own, an appellant is deprived of a hearing, circumstances may exist to vitiate the decision despite compliance with the requirements of the statutory scheme. This possibility was also recognised by the Full Court in SZFML . It is apparent that the facts in each case will be critical in determining whether consent by the appellant to the agent in fact existed.\\n\\n29 This Court considers that it is bound to follow the majority in SZFDE , and to conclude that fraud, even if proved by the appellant, does not vitiate the decision of the Tribunal.\\n\\n30 In view of the above finding, it is not necessary to consider this ground of appeal. However, the Court will nevertheless state its observations.\\n\\n31 The appellant also challenges the finding of Nicholls FM that the MARA Notice would not establish fraudulent conduct by the agent and that the evidence before the Tribunal was not sufficient to establish fraud. The appellant sought to rely upon the MARA Notice as demonstrating a ' propensity ' for the migration agent to have misled the appellant by conduct amounting to fraud, or conduct akin to fraud.\\n\\n33 In written submissions provided after the hearing, the appellant relied upon the dissenting judgment of French J in SZFDE wherein his Honour stated that ' the common law proposition that fraud may vitiate an administrative decision ' extends to cover ' reckless conduct ', and sought to establish that the evidence of the migration agent's wrongful conduct in the MARA Notice is relevant to the question of whether the agent's conduct was reckless. The appellant submitted that the MARA Notice would show a 'system' or 'pattern' and a repetitiveness of conduct which would strengthen the inference to be drawn from such evidence within the meaning of s 97(1) of the Evidence Act .\\n\\n34 Nicholls FM held at [23]:\\n \\n 'Even if the conduct of the agent could be said to be fraudulent (or akin to fraud) none of this material or what the witness was expected to say, went to show irregular conduct on the part of the Tribunal. Nor on the basis of what the Full Court said in NASB where fraud is given as one specific example which could be relevant, does this material go to show fraud or even any other irregular conduct on the part of a Minister or those associated with the Minister. Nor does this material go to show fraud, perjury or other misconduct of a witness before the Tribunal.'\\n\\n36 I am unable to find that there is any jurisdictional error in His Honour's conclusions. Section 55 of the Evidence Act establishes the parameters of the evidence which is admissible. His Honour was also entitled, pursuant to s 97(1)(b) of the Evidence Act to conclude that the evidence had no significant probative value. The evidence of the MARA Notice and of the proposed witness would do no more than establish a suggestion of misleading conduct between the migration agent and other parties. It does not establish any link between the conduct of the migration agent and the appellant in these proceedings. The Court is unable to find any jurisdictional error on the part of Nicholls FM, and the subsequent Full Court decision in SZFDE now conclusively determines that fraud by an agent does not result in jurisdictional error by a Tribunal. It follows that the appeal must be dismissed.\\n\\n37 An order that the appellant pay the costs of the first respondent in the sum of $2700 has been sought. The Court finds such amount to be reasonable and will make the order sought.\\n \\n \\n\\n I certify that the preceding thirty-seven (37) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Cowdroy. \\n\\n\\n Associate:\\n\\nDated: 17 November 2006\\n\\n\\n Counsel for the Appellant: B Zipser \\n \\n Counsel for the Respondent: M A Izzo \\n \\n Solicitor for the Respondent: Sparke Helmore \\n \\n Date of Hearing: 6 November 2006 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 17 November 2006 \\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2006\\/1477.html\",\"4\":\"21 In contrast, in Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs v SZFML and Anor [2006] FCAFC 152 the agent had correctly indicated to the Tribunal that his client wished to attend the hearing. Shortly before the hearing date the Tribunal changed the date. A further invitation was provided to the agent, who responded stating that the appellant did not wish to attend. However evidence established that in fact the appellant, being unaware of the date change, had attended at the hearing on the day and had always wished to provide further evidence in support of her case. Further, cross examination of her agent satisfied the Court that the agent's evidence that he received instruction from the appellant was unreliable. The Full Court found that the appellant had not authorised her agent either generally or specifically to complete the second Response to Invitation form. It concluded that s 441G of the Act had no operation if the agent for the appellant acted beyond the scope of his authority in returning the Response to Invitation contrary to the instructions provided by the appellant. The Full Court confirmed the finding of the Federal Magistrate that where there was no effective consent submitted to the Tribunal by an appellant concerning the hearing, the appellant was not bound by the conduct of the agent.\\n\\n22 The facts of the present case do not raise this issue. The appellant acknowledges that he signed the Response to Invitation form. He did not speak English but he knew that the form related to an invitation to attend the hearing, and he signed the form knowingly indicating that he would not be attending the hearing. His complaint is that he was given the wrong advice by his migration agent, namely that the migration agent would attend the hearing. Unlike the unique circumstances in SZFML, the appellant does not claim that he wanted to attend the hearing. Rather, he was content for the migration agent to attend.\\n\\n23 I consider that the circumstances now before the Court are indistinguishable from those considered in NASF . The appellant has not been denied an opportunity to attend the hearing and the Tribunal complied with the requirements of s 425, in the same way as was found by Bennett J in SZBZL . The Court therefore concludes that there was no jurisdictional error on the part of Nicholls FM.\\n\\n26 In SCAR the Full Court recognised that under certain circumstances the invitation process prescribed by s 425 of the Act may not have been fulfilled (see also SZFML ). However, in SCAR the Full Court found that the Tribunal innocently provided unfair treatment to the appellant in circumstances where the appellant was ill. In Tobasi v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCA 1050 ; (2002) 122 FCR 322, the Tribunal provided a translator who was unable to speak the appellant's language.

Nicholls FM concluded that the details in the MARA Notice and the prospective witness' proposed statement did not ' bridge the gulf between the agent's conduct which led to his deregistration and the elements necessary to prove fraud (or for that matter 'something akin to fraud' whatever that may be) .'\",\"6\":\"19 Numerous authorities have held that, absent any default by the Tribunal in the fulfilment of its statutory obligations relating to the provision of an invitation to attend a hearing, no ground of procedural unfairness arises because of some default on the part of an agent retained by an applicant.
