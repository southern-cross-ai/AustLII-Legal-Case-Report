As this case illustrates, it takes time to dispose of appeals. An order extending a petition which has been dismissed could hardly be made in the meantime. It is, no doubt, for this reason that that point was not taken up either by the Full Court of this Court or by the High Court, notwithstanding invitations to do so by counsel for the applicant creditor. That conclusion is consistent with the reasoning of the Full Court in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Clyne . In other words, in my opinion, 'dismissal' in s 52(4) means dismissal in fact, whether or not subsequently set aside (cf Yilmaz v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 906 ; (2000) 100 FCR 495).\",\"3\":\"6 It is submitted on behalf of the debtor that, as no order has been made pursuant to subsection (5), the petition lapsed at the expiration of the period of 12 months commencing on the date of the presentation of the petition.
