In circumstances where the Tribunal's decision is based on alternative reasons and grounds, relief would not issue. It is unnecessary to deal with an additional argument put by the Minister that even if relief would otherwise issue the Court should not grant it, as a matter of discretion. \\n \\n\\n\\n I certify that the preceding six (6) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Moore. \\n\\n\\nAssociate:\\n\\nDated: 15 February 2006\\n\\n\\n The Appellant appeared in person \\n \\n Counsel for the Respondent: R A Pepper \\n \\n Solicitor for the Respondent: Blake Dawson Waldron \\n \\n Date of Hearing: 8 February 2006 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 8 February 2006 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2006\\/57.html\"}}"
