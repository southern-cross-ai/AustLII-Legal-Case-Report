Such a serious misstatement can hardly be swept aside in that fashion but, in any event, there is no explanation as to how, on the basis of the normal solicitor's assurance, a claim could be valued fully without discount to reflect the chances of failure and for costs ( KGL Health Pty Ltd v Mechtler [2007] FCA 1410). Counsel for Vatera points out that the only particularised claim at that time was $270,000.\\n\\n15 In addition to the difficulties with the report, the DOCA is in an unsatisfactory form. It appears to be a boilerplate that is not well adapted for the particular proposal plus a home grown addition. The result is not acceptable. Upon execution of the DOCA, control of Meribal (including its assets and business) reverted to the director (cl 8.1). Trading is not prohibited.
