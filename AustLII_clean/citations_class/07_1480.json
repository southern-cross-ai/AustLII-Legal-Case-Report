The common law has avoided the technical controversies inherent in the logic of causation. Unlike science and philosophy, the common law is not concerned to discover universal connections between phenomena so as to enable predictions to be made. The common law concept of causation looks backward because its function is to determine whether a person should be held responsible for some past act or omission. Out of the many conditions that combine to produce loss or damage to a person, the common law is concerned with determining only whether some breach of a legal norm was so significant that, as a matter of common sense, it should be regarded as a cause of damage.\\n\\n34 As his Honour's submissions make clear, the common law concept of causation is concerned not only with determining cause and effect but also with attributing legal responsibility. This injects an evaluative element into the enquiry. The Minister's task under s 75 is a factual enquiry about the impact of an action. Although there is an element of indeterminacy injected by the requirement that the action has, will have or be likely to have a significant impact, it is quite different from an enquiry into legal causation.\",\"5\":\"43 The applicant supports the assertion that the impact of actions should be assessed in the context of the impact of other potential actions by referring to Booth v Bosworth [2001] FCA 1453 ; (2001) 114 FCR 39, Minister for Environment and Heritage v Greentree [2004] FCA 741 ; (2004) 138 FCR 198, Greentree v Minister for Environment and Heritage [2005] FCAFC 128 ; (2005) 144 FCR 388, and Brown v Forestry Tasmania and Others (No 4) [2006] FCA 1729 ; (2006) 157 FCR 1. In my view none of these cases supports the applicant's argument.\\n\\n44 Whether or not, in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, this approach would materially alter the assessment of the Anvil Hill Project, I have difficulty in conceiving how one would go about assessing a proposed action in the context of hypothetical\\/potential actions. Be that as it may, however, the Act does not prescribe the frame of reference by which the Minister is to assess the significance or substantiality of an impact upon a protected matter. It contains no requirement that such assessment be confined to a comparison with other, hypothetical, proposed actions. The assessment of whether an impact is or is not significant is a question of fact; Minister for Environment and Heritage v Greentree [2004] FCA 741 ; (2004) 138 FCR 198 at [192] . As such, the delegate was entitled to assess the significance and substantiality of the impact of the proposal as a whole rather than merely in comparison with other potential actions. The applicant's assertion must be rejected.\\n\\n45 The applicant alleges that in assessing the impact of the proposed mine, the delegate failed to take a relevant consideration into account in that:\\n the delegate failed to consider that the greenhouse gas emissions that will result from the action will contribute to \\\"loss of climatic habitat caused by anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gas\\\" which is a key threatening process included in the list under s 183 of the EPBC Act. \\n\\nA process is a key threatening process if it satisfies the criteria established in s 188(3) and (4):\\n \\n (3) A process is a threatening process if it threatens, or may threaten, \\n the survival, abundance or evolutionary development of a native \\n species or ecological community. \\n (4) A threatening process is eligible to be treated as a key threatening \\n process if: \\n \\n \\n \\n (a) it could cause a native species or an ecological community to become eligible for listing in any category, other than conservation dependent; or \\n \\n \\n \\n (b) it could cause a listed threatened species or a listed \\n \\n \\n \\n threatened ecological community to become eligible to be listed in another category representing a higher degree of endangerment; or \\n (c) it adversely affects 2 or more listed threatened species (other than conservation dependent species) or 2 or more listed threatened ecological communities.\\n\\n46 Listing a process as a key threatening process under s 183 authorises the establishment of a threat abatement plan under Part 13 Div 5 of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth). A threat abatement plan must provide for the research, management and other actions necessary to reduce the process to a level that maximises the chances of the survival of affected species and communities.\",\"6\":\"72 While there is no authority directly in point the approach of the Full Court in Minister for Environment and Heritage v Queensland Conservation Council Inc [2004] FCAFC 190 ; (2004) 139 FCR 24 impliedly accepted that the Minister's determination was not subject to merits review by the Court. The Full Court stated at [53] of its reasons:\\n Provided that the concept [of impact] is understood and applied correctly ... it is a question of fact for the Environment Minister whether a particular adverse effect is an \\\"impact\\\" of a proposed action.\\n\\n73 There is, of course, much more that could be said for and against the proposition for which the applicant contends. I am satisfied, however, that for the reasons given the contention of jurisdictional fact cannot be supported.\\n\\n74 For this and all the reasons given above, it is my view that the application must be dismissed with costs. It follows that the question reserved on 25 July 2007 (see [30] above) does not arise. \\n I certify that the preceding seventy-four (74) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Stone. \\n Associate:\\nDated: 20 September 2007\\n Counsel for the Applicant: L McCallum SC, C McGrath Solicitor for the Applicant: Environmental Defenders Office Counsel for the First Respondent: S Gageler SC, S Lloyd, A Mitchelmore Solicitor for the First Respondent: Australian Government Solicitor Counsel for the Second Respondent: MJ Leeming SC Solicitor for the Second Respondent: Blake Dawson Waldron Date of Hearing: 21 and 22 August 2007 Date of Judgment: 20 September 2007 \\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2007\\/1480.html\",\"7\":\"59 The applicant alleges that the delegate's decision that the second respondent's proposed action was not a controlled action was not authorised by the Act and that she did not have jurisdiction to make it. The delegate's decision was based on the factual finding that the proposed mine will not have and is not likely to have a significant impact on a matter protected under Part 3 of the Act. The applicant submits that this fact is a jurisdictional fact. By this it means that the existence of this fact is a precondition to the Minister making a valid decision. In other words, if the Minister's factual finding on this point is in error then he or she has no jurisdiction to decide that the proposed action is not a controlled action. A better way of stating the jurisdictional fact proposition is that to say that the Minister's determination of the fact is not conclusive and that Court has power to review the finding on the basis of evidence as to the existence or non-existence of the fact. As Spigelman CJ pointed out in Timbarra Protection Coalition Inc v Ross Mining NL [1999] NSWCA 8 ; (1999) 46 NSWLR 55 at 71:\\n ... facts, even where they are described as \\\"objective\\\", do not have an existence independent of their identification by some process of human agency. An administrative decision-maker often has to determine jurisdictional facts, but does not do so conclusively. This has been recognised as long ago as Bunbury v Fuller (1853) 9 Ex 111at 140; 156 ER 47 at 60\\n\\n60 Ultimately the question whether a particular finding of fact is jurisdictional depends on the proper construction of the relevant statute. The consequence of characterising a fact as jurisdictional is that the finding of fact can be reviewed on the merits and the court's opinion may be substituted for that of the administrative decision-maker.\\n\\n61 The concept of jurisdictional fact was explained most lucidly by Spigelman CJ in Timbarra at 64:\\n The parliament can make any fact a jurisdictional fact, in the relevant sense: that it must exist in fact (objectivity) and that the legislature intends that the absence or presence of the fact will invalidate action under the statute (essentiality) ... \\n ... \\n Any statutory formulation which contains a factual reference must be construed so as to determine the meaning of the words chosen by parliament, having regard to the context of that statutory formulation and the purpose or object underlying the legislation. There is nothing special about the task of statutory construction with regard to the determination of the issue whether the factual reference is a jurisdictional fact. All the normal rules of statutory construction apply. ... \\n Where the process of construction leads to the conclusion that parliament intended that the factual reference can only be satisfied by the actual existence (or non-existence) of the fact or facts, then the rule of law requires a court with a judicial review jurisdiction to give effect to that intention by inquiry into the existence of the fact or facts.\\n\\n62 In support of the submission that the fact that the proposed mine will not have, or is unlikely to have, a significant impact on matters protected under Part 3 is a jurisdictional fact, the applicant makes four points:\\n (a) the construction for which it contends would best promote the declared objects of the Act;\\n (b) in applying the civil offence provisions or deciding whether to grant an injunction under s 475, the Court must construe the same language, as must the State and Territory courts for the purpose of applying the criminal offence provisions. It would be inconsistent for the Act to provide for the Minister's determination under s 75 to be conclusive when the Court has to determine the same issue under the prohibition sections of Part 3; \\n (c) there is no reference to the Minister's state of mind in s 75 whereas there is in closely related provisions of the Act; \\n (d) the definition of \\\"controlled action\\\" in s 67 and the reference to such actions in s 82 do not refer to the decision of the Minister.\\n\\n63 Section 75(1) obliges the Minister to decide whether an action is a controlled action and, if it is, which provisions of Part 3 are the controlling provisions. The applicant rightly points out that the language of s 75 requires the Minister to recognise his jurisdiction and that it does not follow that the Minister is to determine the issue subjectively. It is relevant that s 75 contains no reference to the Minister's mental state by the use of words such as \\\"opinion\\\", \\\"belief\\\" or \\\"satisfaction\\\" which often signify that the decision is not a jurisdictional fact. While the presence of such terms would almost invariably indicate that the determination of fact is not jurisdictional (see for instance, Vanmeld Pty Ltd v Fairfield City Council [1999] NSWCA 6 ; (1999) 46 NSWLR 78 at 90-91), their absence is not decisive; see Timbarra at 64.

It was submitted to his Honour that the purpose of the enquiry under s 75 of the Act was \\\"to attribute legal responsibility for impacts to matters protected by Pt 3 of the EPBC Act in light of the subject, scope and objects of the Act\\\" . In response to this submission, at [57] of his reasons, observed:\\n I am not sure that the purpose of Part 3 is to attribute legal responsibility for the causation of adverse impacts. To my mind the purpose of the Act is to prevent or minimise such adverse impact. ... Causation is, of course, not mentioned in s 12 or the other analogous sections in Pt 3. However, it was submitted that there is necessarily a causal relationship between an action and any relevant impact. That is probably so, but I see no reason to introduce notions of causation into the process prescribed by s 75. It is not necessary to go beyond the language of the relevant sections.\\n\\n36 His Honour noted that the decision-maker in that matter had accepted the possibility that the coal might be burnt, thereby producing additional greenhouse gases which might cause climate change and said that \\\"The point at which he disagreed with the applicant was as to the likelihood of any adverse impact upon a protected matter and the extent thereof\\\". In my view that is precisely the position here.\\n\\n37 As the written submissions for the Minister point out, it is the link between future conduct and its potential impact that the delegate must investigate. The term \\\"impact\\\" was not defined in the Act until the introduction of s 527E on 19 February 2007, which is the date of the delegate's decision. Given the date of the section's commencement the definition applies to the delegate's decision, although it may be that the decision was made without recourse to the definition. There is, however, nothing in her reasons to indicate that she gave a meaning to the term different to that in the definition.\\n\\n38 Section 527E(1)(a) of the Act states that an event or circumstance is an \\\"impact\\\" of an action if it is a direct consequence of the action. An indirect consequence of an action is also an \\\"impact\\\" if, (subject to s 527E(2) which is not relevant here) the action is \\\"a substantial cause of that event or circumstance\\\"; s 527E(1)(b). As outlined in [26]-[27] above, the delegate accepted that greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are affecting global climate but, although not expressed in these words, she clearly found that the emissions from the proposed mine would not be a substantial cause of climate change affecting matters protected under Part 3 of the Act.\\n\\n39 The submission here is not distinguishable from that considered by Dowsett J in the Wildlife Preservation Society case and it should be dismissed for the reasons his Honour gave. The applicant attempted to distinguish the earlier case on the basis that in this case, unlike in the proceedings before Dowsett J, the delegate was provided with an estimate of the amount of greenhouse gas emissions likely to be produced each year; see [25] above. In my view that is not a ground of distinction. The question is not whether there is an impact but whether that impact is, will be or is likely to be significant. In my view Dowsett J was correct to reject introducing notions of causation into the process described by s 75.\\n\\n40 The applicant criticises the delegate for \\\"attempting to attribute a specific, identifiable and measurable rise in global temperatures or other greenhouse impacts from the mine\\\". I do not accept that this criticism is warranted. It may be that if the delegate had been able to detect such a link she could have reached a positive conclusion that an indirect consequence of the proposed action, namely the construction and operation of a coal mine, was likely to be a substantial and significant cause of harm to matters protected under Part 3. In the absence of such a link, however, the relatively small contribution of the proposed emissions to total global emissions could not be seen as having a significant impact. That is a conclusion that was open to her on the findings she had made.\\n\\n41 Ground 2 of the application for review contains a claim that the delegate ought to have asked, \\\"whether the proposed action is likely to have an impact on a matter protected by Part 3 of the EPBC Act that is important, notable or of consequence having regard to its context or intensity\\\". Paragraph 56 of the applicant's written submissions expands on this argument:\\n The proper approach required the delegate to ask whether the contribution of this proposal to those impacts which climate change is likely to bring to the matters protected by Part 3 of the EPBC Act is important, notable or of consequence having regard to its context not only in the total Australian and global emissions of greenhouse gases but in comparison to other actions that might reasonably be assessed under the EPBC Act . \\n [emphasis added]\"}}"
