"{\"id\":{\"0\":\"c0\"},\"class\":{\"0\":\"considered\"},\"tocase\":{\"0\":\"Military Rehabilitation & Compensation Commission v Perry [2007] FCA 1586\"},\"text\":{\"0\":\"4 The reasons for judgment addressed both issues ( Military Rehabilitation & Compensation Commission v Perry [2007] FCA 1586). The applicant ('the Commission') was successful on the retrospectivity issue but unsuccessful on the construction issue (at [59]-[60]). It was therefore unsuccessful in its challenge to the decision under review in the Tribunal. Accordingly, the application was dismissed (at [61]).\\n\\n5 The parties were given the opportunity to provide submissions on costs. The Commission submits that there should be no order as to the costs of the application or, alternatively, that the Commission pay no more than half of what would otherwise have been Mr Perry's party-party costs. It also submits that the Tribunal's decision, in so far as it relates to costs, should be set aside. The Commission submits that the argument put at the hearing on behalf of Mr Perry was misconceived and that the Tribunal would not have exercised its discretion to award him costs.\\n\\n6 Mr Perry submits that the Commission should pay all of his costs of the proceedings. Mr Perry recognises that the Court has a wide discretion to award costs but submits that there are no special circumstances to preclude costs following the event. In particular, Mr Perry says that there should be no apportionment by reference to the issues in the proceedings. In any event, he submits, the construction of s 8(9B) of the SRC Act was not separate and distinct from the issue on which he succeeded. Mr Perry says that the consideration by the Court of the retrospectivity issue, the issue before the Tribunal, was not necessary to the decision concerning his entitlements, determined by s 8(6) and its relationship to s 8(9B) of the SRC Act. Mr Perry also submits that his approach before the Tribunal was not unreasonable, given the history of the matter and the basis of the decisions taken by the delegates of the Commission.\"}}"
