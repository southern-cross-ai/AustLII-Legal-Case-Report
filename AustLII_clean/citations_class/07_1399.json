In that Full Court decision their Honours observed at 48 that if the issues involved would be better and more comprehensively dealt with in a contested trial of the action in the Supreme Court than if a creditor was required to lodge a proof of debt, a grant of leave should follow.\\n\\n11 The issues as outlined in the Statement of Claim and in the proposed Amended Statement of Claim establish that there are complex factual issues to be determined which, it is apparent, could be determined more effectively in the Supreme Court proceedings.\",\"1\":\"9 The words ' in respect of' which appear in s 58(3)(b) have been considered judicially: see for example Re McMaster; ex parte McMaster (1991) 33 FCR 70 at 72 and in Trustees Executors and Agency Company Ltd v Reilly [1941] ALR 105 at 106. Such authorities refer to the wide scope of the words ' in respect of' as contained in the relevant subsection. The Court is satisfied that for the purposes of s 58(3)(b) of the Act the claim the subject of the Supreme Court proceedings falls within the purview of s 82 and that the Supreme Court proceedings are in respect of a provable debt.
