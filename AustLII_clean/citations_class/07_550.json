I accept that a sham defence may amount to an abuse of process and may be struck out: see Remington v Scoles [1897] 2 Ch D 1.\",\"3\":\"16 The plaintiff sought to adduce evidence to show that the claim that the signatory to the agreement and to the mortgage on behalf of the owner did not have the requisite authority could not genuinely be raised. Obviously, the Court should be slow to be persuaded that a pleaded defence based on a matter of fact is not genuinely raised. However, if the Court is satisfied that a defendant has pleaded a fact which it does not genuinely maintain, the inference must follow that it has some extraneous reason for asserting that fact. It may be as simple as an attempt to delay the inevitable. There may be other reasons. If the fact is pleaded for an extraneous purpose, then it may amount to an abuse of process: see e.g. Williams v Spautz [1992] HCA 34 ; (1992) 174 CLR 509.
