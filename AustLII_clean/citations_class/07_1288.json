"{\"id\":{\"0\":\"c0\"},\"class\":{\"0\":\"considered\"},\"tocase\":{\"0\":\"Walsh v University of Technology, Sydney [2007] FCA 880\"},\"text\":{\"0\":\"5 I have also had regard to the detailed judgment delivered in the proceedings previously brought by Mr Walsh where Buchanan J examined a statement of claim in relation to similar facts, albeit based on different causes of action, and ordered that it be struck out and the proceedings dismissed (see Walsh v University of Technology, Sydney [2007] FCA 880). In that decision, his Honour examined carefully the relevant authorities concerning the dismissal of proceedings, the adequacy of a statement of claim as a proper proceeding, and the necessary elements of a claim under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth). There is no need to recite those principles here. While his Honour held in that case that the Court had jurisdiction because Mr Walsh had pleaded the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), in the present case, and apparently as a consequence of his Honour's earlier decision, the draft statement of claim has been amended to exclude that claim with the result that it fails to incorporate a federal element, and as a consequence this Court has no jurisdiction.\\n\\n6 Accordingly, I order that the proceedings brought by Mr Walsh be dismissed with costs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n I certify that the preceding six (6) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Tamberlin. \\n\\n\\n Associate:\\n\\nDated: 21 August 2007\\n\\n\\n Counsel for the Applicant: None \\n \\n Solicitor for the Applicant: None \\n \\n Counsel for the Respondent: Mr P.
