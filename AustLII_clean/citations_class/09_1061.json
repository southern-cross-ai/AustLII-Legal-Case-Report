Further, his decision does not work an injustice, whether substantial or otherwise, to the applicant. The primary judge has made no decision in relation to the disposition of the respondent's motion. The applicant will have every opportunity to respond to the matters raised by the respondent at the hearing of the motion. All that has happened is that preliminary steps have been taken by the primary judge to enable the parties to file and exchange contentions of fact and law which will facilitate the disposition of the hearing of the respondent's notice of motion.\\n\\nIt was for these reasons that I dismissed the application for leave to appeal. \\n I certify that the preceding eighteen (18) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Goldberg. \\n \\n Associate:\\n \\n \\nDated: 18 September 2009\\n \\n Counsel for the Applicant: The applicant appeared in person \\n \\n Counsel for the Respondent: S Bond \\n \\n Solicitor for the Respondent: Schetzer Brott & Appel \\n Date of Hearing: 17 September 2009 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 17 September 2009 \\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2009\\/1061.html\"}}"
