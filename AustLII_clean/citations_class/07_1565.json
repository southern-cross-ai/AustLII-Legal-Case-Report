Their Honours referred to a series of authorities in which this statement had been made including Abebe v Commonwealth [1999] HCA 14 ; (1999) 197 CLR 510: see Abebe at [83] [84] per Gleeson CJ and \\nMcHugh J.\",\"1\":\"15 After some debate, I came to the view that the question was \\\"manifestly unsound\\\" and did not require a notice to be given under s 78B: see Applicant S453 of 2003 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1106 at [36] .\\n\\n16 I will set out my reasons on that question later.\\n\\n17 The background facts are set out in the Issues Paper supplied to the Minister to seek his decision on whether Mr Ngaronoa passed the character test and, if not, whether to cancel the visa.\",\"2\":\"71 In summary, the Minister must not act arbitrarily or capriciously. The satisfaction of the decision-maker must be based on findings or inferences of fact that are supported by some probative material or logical grounds: see Eshetu at [145]; see also Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321 at 365-366.\",\"3\":\"46 The authorities make it clear that the Minister is not bound to proceed by reference to a direction under s 499 but it is open to the Minister to use the direction as a guide: Black v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1249 at [19] ; Howells v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 327 ; (2004) 139 FCR 580 at [31] .\\n\\n55 I do not consider that the remarks of Besanko J in Black at [24] [27] support the proposition urged upon me by counsel for Mr Ngaronoa, that the Minister is precluded from considering, in the exercise of the discretion, matters upon which the person was acquitted in criminal proceedings.\\n\\n56 What must be borne in mind is that the present case is concerned with the exercise of the discretion, not the determination that Mr Ngaronoa failed to satisfy the character test. Whilst it would not have been open to the Minister to determine that Mr Ngaronoa had a substantial criminal record on the basis of charges on which he was acquitted, that was not the question which fell for determination: cf s 501(10).\\n\\n57 Having satisfied himself that Mr Ngaronoa met the precondition, namely failure to satisfy the character test by reason of the term of imprisonment of four years and six months, the question was whether it was open to the Minister to look to conduct engaged in by Mr Ngaronoa in 2006, regardless of whether that conduct was the subject of a criminal conviction.\\n\\n58 In my view, the authorities to which I have referred establish that the Minister was not constrained from having regard to \\\"general conduct\\\" provided that it pertained to matters affecting the protection of the Australian community. In my opinion, the matter to which the Minister referred did so pertain.\\n\\n59 I will deal below with the applicant's second ground, namely the question of whether, in considering the matters on which Mr Ngaronoa was acquitted, the Minister applied the correct standard of proof.\\n\\n72 Although the Minister based his findings on the matters incidental to the attack on Ms Haug upon the \\\"balance of probabilities\\\", this must be read in light of the well-known warning against over-zealous scrutiny of the decision-maker's reasons. The statements made in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 271-272, apply to the reasons of the Minister: see Black at [23].\\n\\n80 The burden of weighing these considerations was one for the Minister. It has not been established that the Minister acted outside the terms of his statutory power: see Black at [26].\\n\\n81 It was accepted on behalf of Mr Ngaronoa that he had received a summary of the protected information relating to the attack on Ms Haug. It was not contended that the summary was inaccurate or misleading.\\n\\n82 What was submitted was that the letter, under which the summary was provided, did not indicate how the information contained in the summary might be used by the Minister, or how the Applicant might respond.\",\"4\":\"11 This ground is based upon a statement in the Minister's reasons that the standard of proof he applied in making his decision was the balance of probabilities, not the criminal standard. Mr Ngaronoa's counsel submitted that the Minister ought to have applied the Briginshaw standard: see Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34 ; (1938) 60 CLR 336.\\n\\n12 The third ground is that Mr Ngaronoa was denied procedural fairness in relation to the use that was made of the protected information. Although the substance of the protected information was provided to Mr Ngaronoa, his counsel submitted that he was not told, nor was it apparent on the face of the material, that the conduct would be taken into account in the exercise of the Minister's discretion.\\n\\n13 Mr Ngaronoa's counsel also contended that this proceeding involves a matter arising under the Constitution or involving its interpretation. A direction was sought for notice to be given to the Attorneys-General of the Commonwealth and States under s 78B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth).\\n\\n66 Counsel for Mr Ngaronoa submitted that in the context of administrative proceedings, the decision-maker is bound to have regard to the well-known statement of Dixon J in Briginshaw at 361-362.\\n\\n67 There, his Honour drew attention in the context of curial proceedings, to the requirement that a judge should reach a state of reasonable satisfaction having regard to the seriousness of the allegations and of their consequences. Dixon J also said that \\\"reasonable satisfaction\\\" should not be produced by inexact proofs, indefinite testimony or indirect references.\\n\\n68 In QAAH v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 136 ; (2005) 145 FCR 363 at [102] [103], Madgwick J considered that the observations of \\nDixon J in Briginshaw could be applied to a decision made by the Refugee Review Tribunal. However, the decision of the majority judges in the Full Court in QAAH (Wilcox and Madgwick JJ) was reversed by the High Court: see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v QAAH [2006] HCA 53 ; (2007) 231 ALR 340.\",\"5\":\"94 The Constitutional question which was said to arise was the \\\"guarantee\\\" in s 80 of the Constitution to a trial by jury on indictment for an offence against any law of the Commonwealth. Reference was made to Cheatle v The Queen [1993] HCA 44 ; (1993) 177 CLR 541 at 552 and Kingswell v The Queen [1985] HCA 72 ; (1985) 159 CLR 264 at 292, 301.\",\"6\":\"83 This submission is based upon the principle that procedural fairness:-\\n \\n \\\"... extends to require the decision-maker to identify to the person affected any issue critical to the decision which is not apparent from its nature or the terms of the statute under which it is made. The decision-maker is required to advise of any adverse conclusion ... which would not obviously be open on the known material.\\\" See Commissioner for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Limited (1994) 49 FCR 576 at 592.\\n\\n87 In my view, this was sufficient to satisfy the test stated in Alphaone. Mr Ngaronoa was informed in the letter that the Minister could take into account the material stated in the summary of protected information in his decision to cancel the visa. The use to which the Minister could put the information was sufficiently described. This is not a case in which a fresh obligation was enlivened within the test required in Navarrete because Mr Ngaronoa was told how the material could be used.\",\"7\":\"49 The discretion is not fettered by any express limitation but it must be exercised by reference to conditions identified from the subject matter, scope and purpose of the Act: see Jahnke v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 897 ; (2001) 113 FCR 268 at [17] ; Huynh at [73]; see also Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Limited [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 40; Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at [69] ; Haneef v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1273 at [189] .\\n\\n61 I do not consider that the observations of Spender J in Haneef detract from the conclusion I have reached on the question of relevant considerations.\\n\\n62 In Haneef , Spender J was concerned with the proper construction of s 501(6)(b) of the Act which states one of the criteria for determining whether a person passes the character test.\\n\\n63 In particular, the question before Spender J was the proper construction of the composite phrase \\\"has an association with someone else ... who the Minister reasonably suspects has been, or is involved in criminal conduct.\\\" His Honour considered that the proper construction of the phrase was to be ascertained from its context and purpose: see [152], [178] [179].\\n\\n64 It is true that his Honour came to the view that s 501(6)(b) required an alliance or link between the visa holder and the persons engaged in criminal activity. It is this factor which reflects adversely on the character of the visa holder: see [230].\\n\\n65 However, it seems to me that his Honour's conclusion related only to the question of whether an \\\"innocent\\\" association fell within the second criterion of the character test stated in s 501(6)(b). It was not concerned with the breadth of the discretion which is conferred on the Minister in the event that the necessary precondition is met: see [269] [271].\",\"8\":\"92 The question is one of statutory construction of s 503A. It may well be that having exercised his discretion to provide a summary of the protected information, the rules of procedural fairness applied: Hill v Green [1999] NSWCA 477 ; (1999) 48 NSWLR 161 at [32] [34], [39].\",\"9\":\"72 Although the Minister based his findings on the matters incidental to the attack on Ms Haug upon the \\\"balance of probabilities\\\", this must be read in light of the well-known warning against over-zealous scrutiny of the decision-maker's reasons.

Any guarantee is restricted to a trial on indictment for an offence against any law of the Commonwealth. It does not provide a basis for drawing an implied guarantee that is not expressed in the section: Kingswell at 276-277.\\n\\n98 Second, Mr Ngaronoa was not tried by a jury for an offence against a law of the Commonwealth. He was tried under State law.\\n\\n99 Third, what underlies the submission is the proposition that an administrative decision-maker is precluded from looking at factual allegations of criminal conduct on which the person affected was acquitted. That proposition cannot be correct, except insofar as it relates to the threshold character test and s 501(10) of the Act. A different enquiry is involved in the exercise of the Minister's discretion.\",\"13\":\"49 The discretion is not fettered by any express limitation but it must be exercised by reference to conditions identified from the subject matter, scope and purpose of the Act: see Jahnke v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 897 ; (2001) 113 FCR 268 at [17] ; Huynh at [73]; see also Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Limited [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 40; Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at [69] ; Haneef v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1273 at [189] .\",\"14\":\"70 It seems to me to follow that the same approach must be applied to the decision of the Minister to exercise his discretion to cancel a visa. The correct approach in my opinion is that stated by Gummow J in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Eshetu [1999] HCA 21 ; (1999) 197 CLR 611, in his review of the relevant authorities at [130] [145].\\n\\n71 In summary, the Minister must not act arbitrarily or capriciously. The satisfaction of the decision-maker must be based on findings or inferences of fact that are supported by some probative material or logical grounds: see Eshetu at [145]; see also Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321 at 365-366.\",\"15\":\"91 Counsel for the Minister submitted that in any event the Minister was not obliged to satisfy the requirements of procedural fairness in relation to protected information under \\n s 503A of the Act: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Ball [2004] FCAFC 91 ; (2004) 138 FCR 450 at [30] , [90] [91]. It would follow, so it was argued, that the Minister was under no obligation to provide a summary and that procedural fairness did not require him to explain the use that could be made of the information.\\n\\n93 Although the question does not arise in the present case, the consequence of the Minister's submissions is that it would be open to him, for instance, to provide an inaccurate or misleading summary of the protected information without regard to the rules of procedural fairness. I do not consider that this question was decided in Ball and am inclined to the view that the submission must be rejected.\",\"16\":\"79 That is not to gainsay the proposition that the decision to cancel a visa is a serious one. The practical effect of the decision is that Mr Ngaronoa will be permanently excluded under Australian law from returning here: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Griffiths [2004] FCAFC 22 at [3] . Nevertheless in the exercise of his discretion, the Minister was entitled to determine that the protection of the Australian community outweighed all other considerations, notwithstanding his view that compassionate considerations weighed against removal.\",\"17\":\"48 In Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Huynh [2004] FCAFC 256 ; (2004) 139 FCR 505, Kiefel and Bennett JJ observed at [72] the Act does not state what factors the Minister is bound to consider in determining whether or not to cancel a visa. Their Honours referred to a number of authorities which make it clear that a precondition for the exercise of the discretion is failure to satisfy the character test.\\n\\n49 The discretion is not fettered by any express limitation but it must be exercised by reference to conditions identified from the subject matter, scope and purpose of the Act: see Jahnke v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 897 ; (2001) 113 FCR 268 at [17] ; Huynh at [73]; see also Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Limited [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 40; Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at [69] ; Haneef v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1273 at [189] .\\n\\n50 In Huynh , the majority justices pointed out at [74] that a reference to the subject matter, scope and purpose confirms the breadth of the Minister's discretion. The object of the Act is to regulate, in the national interest, the entry into and presence in Australia of non-citizens: see Huynh at [74]. It follows from what their Honours said that the Minister is not bound to consider the level of involvement in an offence which carries a sentence of imprisonment for the requisite term; nevertheless, he or she may do so in the exercise of the discretion.\\n\\n51 It also follows, in my view from the wording of s 501 considered as a whole, and from the observations of their Honours in Huynh , that the Minister was not precluded in the exercise of his discretion, from having regard to conduct in respect of which charges were laid but on which Mr Ngaronoa was acquitted.\\n\\n52 First, as is implicit in the observations of their Honours in Huynh, the object of the provision is not confined to prohibiting the entry or presence in Australia of persons who have been convicted of criminal conduct.\",\"18\":\"68 In QAAH v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 136 ; (2005) 145 FCR 363 at [102] [103], Madgwick J considered that the observations of \\nDixon J in Briginshaw could be applied to a decision made by the Refugee Review Tribunal. However, the decision of the majority judges in the Full Court in QAAH (Wilcox and Madgwick JJ) was reversed by the High Court: see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v QAAH [2006] HCA 53 ; (2007) 231 ALR 340.\",\"19\":\"53 Second, as a Full Court observed in Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs v Baker (1997) 73 FCR 187 at 194, s 501 is concerned with a person's conduct, either \\\"general conduct\\\" or conduct of a more particular kind which may be described as \\\"criminal conduct\\\". This may be seen quite clearly in s 501(6) which provides that a person does not pass the character test if he or she has a substantial criminal record (see s 501(6)(a) or is not of good character having regard to, inter alia , the person's past and present general conduct. (See s 501(6)(c)(ii)).\\n\\n54 Third, Direction No. 21 states that the object of the Act is to regulate in the national interest, the coming into and presence in Australia of non-citizens. It also states that the Minister has a responsibility to protect the community from criminal and \\\"other reprehensible conduct\\\".\",\"20\":\"85 In Navarrete v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1723 at [38] , Allsop J recognised that this principle may require the Minister to do more than merely provide a person with a copy of s 501 , Direction No. 21 and his or her criminal record. How the material is to be treated by the Department in its Ministerial recommendation may enliven a fresh obligation to bring a critical aspect to the attention of the person affected: Navarrete at [38].\\n\\n86 The Third Notice did not merely refer to the charges arising from the attack. It attached a summary of the information that the Department identified as material that might be relied upon to assess whether to exercise the discretion to cancel Mr Ngaronoa's visa. The covering letter told Mr Ngaranoa that he had an opportunity to comment on the information. It informed him that if he did not provide any further information, the Minister might rely upon the information identified in the letter to determine that the visa was liable to cancellation: see [31] above.\\n\\n87 In my view, this was sufficient to satisfy the test stated in Alphaone. Mr Ngaronoa was informed in the letter that the Minister could take into account the material stated in the summary of protected information in his decision to cancel the visa. The use to which the Minister could put the information was sufficiently described. This is not a case in which a fresh obligation was enlivened within the test required in Navarrete because Mr Ngaronoa was told how the material could be used.\",\"21\":\"49 The discretion is not fettered by any express limitation but it must be exercised by reference to conditions identified from the subject matter, scope and purpose of the Act: see Jahnke v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 897 ; (2001) 113 FCR 268 at [17] ; Huynh at [73]; see also Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Limited [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 40; Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at [69] ; Haneef v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1273 at [189] .\",\"22\":\"68 In QAAH v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 136 ; (2005) 145 FCR 363 at [102] [103], Madgwick J considered that the observations of \\nDixon J in Briginshaw could be applied to a decision made by the Refugee Review Tribunal. However, the decision of the majority judges in the Full Court in QAAH (Wilcox and Madgwick JJ) was reversed by the High Court: see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v QAAH [2006] HCA 53 ; (2007) 231 ALR 340.\",\"23\":\"88 It is true, as Allsop J observed in Sales v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1807 at [31] , that in circumstances such as the present, procedural fairness requires an objectively adequate opportunity for the person affected to deal with the task that is presented.\\n\\n89 In Sales , Allsop J considered that a period of fourteen days was insufficient for a person to respond to a notice of intention to cancel a visa. His Honour took into account the difficulties faced by a person who had spent most of his adult life in prison. His Honour also pointed to the serious personal consequences to the applicant and his family of an adverse decision by the Minister: see Sales at [32] [34].\\n\\n90 By contrast, in the present case, it seems to me that it was sufficiently clear to Mr Ngaronoa how the summary of the protected information could be used by the Minister. I have come to that view on an objective consideration of the terms of the Third Notice and the attached summary. The gravity of the allegations set out in the summary speak for themselves. I have had regard to Mr Ngaronoa's personal circumstances. I do not consider it is a matter on which evidence of his subjective thought processes would have assisted.\",\"24\":\"84 That passage was referred to by the High Court, with apparent approval, in SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 ; (2007) 231 ALR 592 at [29] , [49].\"}}"
