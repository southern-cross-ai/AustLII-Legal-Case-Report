Whether those claims in fact rise to that level, bearing in mind that we are dealing with the future, and not the past, is a matter for the Tribunal, and not for this Court. See SZBOV v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1407 per Jacobson J (at [19]). Given that the point is arguable, I consider that the matter should be remitted to the Tribunal to be determined according to law.\\n\\nIt follows for the reasons set out above that the appeal should be allowed. The orders of the Federal Magistrate dismissing the application for review, and ordering the appellants to pay costs, should be set aside. In lieu thereof, a writ of certiorari should issue directed to the Tribunal, quashing its decision. A writ of mandamus should also issue directing that the matter be heard and determined according to law.\\n\\nThe appellants should have their costs, if any, of the proceeding before the Federal Magistrates Court. They are entitled also to have their costs, if any, of the appeal to this Court. \\n\\n\\n I certify that the preceding eighty-seven (87) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Weinberg. \\n\\n Associate:\\n\\nDated: 18 August 2006\\n\\n \\n The First Appellant appeared in person on behalf of all Appellants \\n \\n Counsel for the First Respondent: Mr R Knowles \\n \\n Solicitors for the First Respondent: Clayton Utz \\n \\n Date of Hearing: 2 May 2006 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 18 August 2006 \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2006\\/1095.html\",\"7\":\"Nonetheless, when faced with a claim such as the present, which centres upon an allegation of long standing and insidious anti-Semitism, and which the husband contended was still prevalent in Latvia, the Tribunal was bound to consider that claim.

See, for example, VTAO , where Merkel J took a similar approach. In that case his Honour found, just as I have done, that the Tribunal's failure to consider a series of claims cumulatively gave rise to a constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction.\"}}"
