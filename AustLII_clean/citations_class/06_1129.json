In Chandler v Alberta Association of Architects [1989] 2 SCR 848 Sopinka J, who delivered the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada, said (at 862): \\\"If the Tribunal has failed to dispose of an issue which is fairly raised by the proceedings and of which the tribunal is empowered by its enabling statute to dispose, it ought to be allowed to complete its statutory task.\\\"\\n\\n42 In my view the Panel is entitled to proceed with Mr Hoff's application. Contrary to the Panel's stated view, the undertaking proffered by Pendant does not in fact dispose of all the matters raised by the application. I mean by this that the undertaking, which has the limited effect I have given it, did not create a situation where there could be competitive bidding for the shares in Tower, and this may be the only appropriate remedy if Mr Hoff can make out some of his complaints.\\n\\n43 In any event, it is clear that the Panel has made an important mistake in the effect of the undertaking. It is not necessary to determine whether the mistake is one of fact (the meaning of words in the undertaking) or one of law (how the undertaking is to be applied to the known facts). It is enough for me to hold (as I do) that the mistake is of such importance that it warrants the Tribunal pressing ahead with the application.\",\"2\":\"38 It is not, however, only in the case of jurisdictional error that an administrative decision-maker can correct error. For example in the Comptroller-General of Customs v Kawasaki Motors Pty Ltd (1991) 103 ALR 661 Beaumont J said (at 667) that \\\"where it appears to a decision-maker that his or her decision has preceded upon a wrong factual basis, it is appropriate, proper and necessary that the decision-maker withdraw his or her decision.\\\"\",\"3\":\"39 Similar statements appear in the judgment of Gillard J in Kabourakis v Medical Practitioners Board of Victoria [2005] VSC 493. There the Medical Practitioners Board of Victoria, a statutory body, conducted an informal hearing into the professional conduct of a doctor and made a finding about that conduct but, by mistake, had overlooked some evidence. There was no express provision in the relevant statute allowing the board to set aside its finding. Nevertheless, Gillard J said at [48] that \\\"if a decision made by a statutory body, which was clearly made in error or as a result of some obvious mistake, it is an offence to common sense to suggest that the only avenue open to correct the error is to appeal, state a case, or seek judicial review.\\\" He went on to say that an administrative decision-maker should be entitled \\\"to correct an obvious error by revisiting the process\\\". Gillard J accepted that if the statute under which the administrative decision-maker was acting prevented the decision from being re-opened then of course it could not be.\",\"4\":\"37 In Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Bhardwaj [2002] HCA 11 ; (2002) 209 CLR 597 it was held that if an administrative decision-maker commits a jurisdictional error in reaching his decision, the decision is liable to be set aside but, whether set aside or not, the decision-maker can correct the error in a later decision. So, if the Panel committed a jurisdictional error in arriving at its decision that the undertaking proffered by Pendant rendered it inappropriate to make a declaration of unacceptable circumstances, it could still deal with the application. It would, of course, be necessary, if it went ahead, for the Panel to release Pendant from the earlier undertaking.\\n\\n40 There is a passage in the speech of Lord Reid in Ridge v Baldwin [1963] UKHL 2 ; [1964] AC 40, 79 which is to a like effect. Lord Reid said: \\\"I do not doubt that if an officer or body realises it has acted hastily and reconsiders the whole matter afresh, after affording to the person affected a proper opportunity to present his case, then its later decision will be valid.\\\" In Bhardwaj Gleeson CJ referred (at 603) to this passage with apparent approval but noted that the general proposition stated by Lord Reid \\\"must yield to the legislation under which a decision-maker is acting\\\". To a like effect are the comments of Gummow J in Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs v Kurtovic (1990) 21 FCR 193, 211, 218-219.

If that results in a construction that it is not necessarily grammatically accurate, so be it. But this approach will not permit a meaning to be given to an undertaking which is different from its clear meaning. In this connection it was not suggested that I should apply by analogy the approach developed for the construction of statutes under which it is permissible to modify the literal meaning of words in order to avoid absurd or unreasonable results: see for example: Saraswati v The Queen [1991] HCA 21 ; (1991) 172 CLR 1, 21-23.\\n\\n27 Turning now to the undertaking itself, relevantly, Pendant's undertaking in the case of a \\\"Superior bid\\\" (a defined expression) is to increase its offer so that it is \\\"at least equal to that offered under the Superior bid\\\" (cl D(c)) or, if the Superior bid is not made by a member of Tower, to give a notice under r 120.2 offering to sell the Equity Partners' parcel \\\"to shareholders at a price per share not higher than the price offered in the Superior bid\\\" and if they are not taken up by shareholders to accept the Superior bid (cl D(d)). The question in each case is how does one determine the price of the Superior bid?\\n\\n28 It is common ground that Quadrant's off-market bid is a Superior bid. It is a Superior bid because the offer made under the bid was for a cash price of more than $1.45 per share, the offer was sent to shareholders on 14 July 2006 and the offer became free of all conditions before 28 July 2006. That is, all the conditions specified in cl D(a) and (b) were satisfied.\",\"8\":\"40 There is a passage in the speech of Lord Reid in Ridge v Baldwin [1963] UKHL 2 ; [1964] AC 40, 79 which is to a like effect.

This is the position in the case of orders made by a court (as to which see Yates Property Corporation Pty Ltd v Boland (1998) 89 FCR 78) and it should be the same in relation to an undertaking given under s 201A , especially if the undertaking was required by the Panel. Put another way, the meaning of an undertaking is to be determined having regard to its stated purpose.\"}}"
