It is submitted that this situation falls within the category discussed by the majority of the High Court in Foots v Southern Cross Mine Management Pty Ltd [2007] HCA 56 ; (2007) 241 ALR 32 , (2007) 5 ABC(NS) 419 at [35], [36] and [67]. As here, the order was made before bankruptcy ensued and, therefore, even though not quantified, the debt is provable in bankruptcy. However, that means that, generally speaking, one cannot pursue a matter in court against the debtor once bankruptcy ensues. The appropriate thing to do is to file a proof of debt. Recognising that this is likely to be the position, the applicant seeks leave to proceed against both of the trustees. I am satisfied that both trustees have knowledge of this application. One, as I have said, has appeared and does not oppose leave; the other, having been given notice of the application, responded that he did not propose to appear in the matter. Those trustees have not formally been made parties to the proceeding. Counsel submits that leave should be granted and the matter proceed today for a number of reasons. I should note that the lump sum order which I propose to make will be made in relation to the fifth and sixth respondents in any event and, thus, I have had to consider the merits of the matter.\\n\\n7 To lodge a proof of debt in each of the bankrupt estates would, first of all, require a proof of debt to be prepared. Secondly, it would require the trustee to consider that proof of debt and that would require some investigation. All of that seems to me to be time and money which should not be spent. It is unlikely to be recovered from anybody and, as the Court has had to do the work, it seems pointless to have it repeated. None of the relevant parties appear to oppose the orders. It seems to me that there will be unnecessary duplication if leave is not granted. Furthermore, the quantification of costs, the question that arises here, is very much a matter for the Court and Court officials and those with the knowledge of the way these things are done. The trustees in bankruptcy would have no particular qualifications to assess the situation. So as a matter of substance, I am satisfied that the orders should be made as sought.\\n\\n8 I have raised with counsel the question of the trustees not being parties to the litigation. The grant of leave to proceed against the named individual respondents is probably sufficient for the technicalities to be observed. It is then for the trustees to deal with the result which ensues. If this occasions any difficulty, or if there is any need for any further order, I will grant special liberty to apply to the trustees of the bankrupt estates of the third and fourth respondents.\",\"3\":\"5 The principles which govern the application and the circumstances under which this rule is to be applied were dealt with by Lehane J in Hadid v Lenfest Communications Inc [2000] FCA 628 particularly at [22] [27]; and by Sackville J in Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd [2007] FCA 2059 , particularly at [16] and [25] [34].
