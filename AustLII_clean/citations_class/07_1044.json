ASIC in accordance with its natural justice obligations (see Johns v Australian Securities Commission [1993] HCA 56 ; (1993) 178 CLR 408), has notified third parties who may be affected by the release of the documents and has received submissions from some of them. This has proved to be a lengthy process and ASIC has not yet provided any documents to the applicant.\\n\\n13 As has been mentioned, the documents the subject of item 1 of the subpoena number about 3000 (assuming, as seems reasonable, that ASIC retains the documents it has reviewed, or most of them) and have been sorted into some 200 folders. The remaining documents sought would seem to be relatively much less numerous.\\n\\n14 The present proceeding commenced on 18 December 2006. Pleadings have been filed. Multiplex has brought applications for (i) an order under s 33N of the Federal Court Act that the matter no longer proceed under Pt IVA, (ii) security for costs and (iii) transfer to the New South Wales District Registry. Finkelstein J heard the s 33N application on 27 April 2007 and his decision is reserved. The other two applications have not yet been heard. I understand that a date will be fixed after his Honour delivers judgment on the s 33N application. The matter is in Finkelstein J's docket and the present application has come before me as duty judge.\\n\\n15 The parties have been in protracted negotiations as to security for costs. The applicant accepts that security should be ordered but the parties have not agreed on quantum or the form of security, due mainly to disputes about the likely extent of discovery (security is not sought at the moment for steps beyond discovery). Initially Multiplex sought $24.1 million, of which $24 million was for discovery based on a review of 3.5 million documents with approximately 880,000 potentially discoverable documents. That figure has since been reduced to $6 million, based on an estimate of 266,000 documents. The applicant proffers $1.9 million.\\n\\n16 The applicant relies particularly on the assistance the subpoena will give in narrowing the scope of discovery and, as a consequence, reducing the amount of security ordered.\\n\\n21 Further it is said that the subpoena would subvert ASIC's natural justice considerations as required by Johns .\\n\\n22 Insofar as the subpoena by items 4 and 5 seeks the terms of reference and report of the consultant, it is said to be fishing and enquiring after irrelevant matter.\",\"1\":\"23 It has been firmly established since the decision of Toohey J when a judge of this Court in Hughes v Western Australian Cricket Association (Inc) (1986) 66 ALR 541 that a subpoena duces tecum may be directed to a non-party prior to trial. The power exists \\\"where it appears to the court to be in the interests of justice and the proper and expeditious conduct of a proceeding that a person produce documents before the date of hearing of the [substantive] application\\\": at 543. (That case was the converse of the present in that issue of the subpoena was opposed by the proposed recipient, the Australian Cricket Board, but the respondent in the proceeding did not appear.)\\n\\n24 In the present case senior counsel for Multiplex cited a line of cases which hold that a subpoena duces tecum is not to be used as a substitute for discovery: Commissioner for Railways v Small (1938) 38 SR (NSW) 564, Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Shell Co of Australia Ltd (1999) 161 ALR 686, Pasini v Vanstone [1999] FCA 1271. However, all these cases were concerned with subpoenas directed to a party. True it is that in Hughes (at 543) Toohey J, citing Small , said that a party may not though a subpoena \\\"obtain discovery from a stranger to the action\\\". But what was meant by obtaining discovery from a stranger emerges from the judgment of Jordan CJ in Small at 573:\\n \\n \\\"If [a subpoena duces tecum ] be addressed to a stranger, it must specify with reasonable particularity the documents which are required to be produced. A subpoena duces tecum ought not to be issued to such a person requiring him to search for and produce all such documents as he may have in his possession or power relating to a particular subject matter. It is not legitimate to use a subpoena for the purpose of endeavouring to obtain what would be in effect discovery of documents against a person who, being a stranger, is not liable to make discovery. A stranger to the cause ought not to be required to go to trouble and perhaps to expense in ransacking his records and endeavouring to form a judgment as to whether any of his papers throw light on a dispute which is to be litigated upon issues of which he is presumably ignorant\\\".\",\"2\":\"24 In the present case senior counsel for Multiplex cited a line of cases which hold that a subpoena duces tecum is not to be used as a substitute for discovery: Commissioner for Railways v Small (1938) 38 SR (NSW) 564, Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Shell Co of Australia Ltd (1999) 161 ALR 686, Pasini v Vanstone [1999] FCA 1271.
