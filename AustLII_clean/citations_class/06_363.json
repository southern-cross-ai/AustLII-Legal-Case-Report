Reliance was placed on the well known passage from the judgment of Heydon JA in Makita Australia Pty Ltd v Sprowles Pty Ltd [2001] NSWCA 305 ; (2001) 52 NSWLR 705 at [85] which includes the following:\\n \\n \\\"...so far as the opinion is based on facts 'observed' by the expert, they must be identified and admissibly proved by the expert, and so far as the opinion is based on 'assumed' or 'accepted' facts, they must be identified and proved in some other way.\\\"\\n\\n7 However, I accept the submission of senior counsel for Cadbury that this aspect of Makita has not been followed in the Federal Court.

Such lack of proof merely goes to the weight which may be given to the opinion: Sydneywide Distributors Pty Ltd v Red Bull Australia Pty Ltd (2002) 55 IPR 354 at [16] (Branson J) and at [87] (Weinberg and Dowsett JJ), Neowarra v Western Australia (No 1) (2006) FCR 208 at [16],[21]-[27] (Sundberg J), Jango v Northern Territory (No 4) (2004) 214 ALR 608 at [19] (Sackville J). This line of authority is consistent with the earlier High Court common law decision in Ramsay v Watson [1961] HCA 65 ; (1961) 108 CLR 642 at 649.\",\"5\":\"Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 363 (31 March 2006) \\n\\n [ Home ] [ Databases ] [ WorldLII ] [ Search ] [ Feedback ] Federal Court of Australia You are here: &nbsp; AustLII >> Databases >> Federal Court of Australia >> 2006 >> [2006] FCA 363 \\n\\n [ Database Search ] [ Name Search ] [ Recent Decisions ] [ Noteup ] [ Download ] [ Help ] Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 363 (31 March 2006) \\nLast Updated: 7 April 2006 \\n FEDERAL COURT OF AUSTRALIA \\n\\n Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd \\n [2006] FCA 363 \\n \\n\\n\\n EVIDENCE opinion evidence as to likely consumer behaviour excluded not outside the knowledge and experience of a trier of fact evidence of opinion as to ordinary human nature not admissible alternatively evidence would be excluded on discretionary grounds\\n\\n\\n Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) ss 79 , 135 \\n\\n Makita Australia Pty Ltd v Sprowles Pty Ltd [2001] NSWCA 305 ; (2001) 52 NSWLR 705 at [85] not followed\\n Sydneywide Distributors Pty Ltd v Red Bull Australia Pty Ltd (2002) 55 IPR 354 at [16] followed \\n Neowarra v Western Australia (No 1 ) (2006) FCR 208 at [16], [21]-[27] followed \\n Jango v Northern Territory (No 4) (2004) 214 ALR 608 at [19] followed\\n Ramsay v Watson [1961] HCA 65 ; (1961) 108 CLR 642 at 649 cited\\n R v Turner [1975] QB 834 at 841 followed\\n Murphy v The Queen [1989] HCA 28 ; (1989) 167 CLR 94 at 111 followed\\n Quick v Stoland Pty Ltd (1998) 87 FCR 371 at 382 followed\\n Velevski v The Queen [2002] HCA 4 ; (2002) 187 ALR 233 cited\\n Dalgety Spillers Foods Ltd v Food Brokers Ltd [1994] FSR 504 at 527 cited\\n Symonds Cider & English Wine Company Ltd v Showerings (Ireland) Ltd [1997] 1 IEHC 1 at [20] cited\\n Transport Publishing Co Pty Ltd v The Literature Board of Review [1956] HCA 73 ; (1956) 99 CLR 111 at 119 followed\\n Cat Media Pty Ltd v Opti-Healthcare Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 133 at [55] cited\\n Domain Names Australia Pty Ltd v .au Domain Administration Ltd [2004] FCAFC 247 ; (2004) 139 FCR 215 at [21] cited\\n\\nLigertwood, Australian Evidence , 4 th Edition, 2004 at 494 \\n \\nHeydon, Cross on Evidence , 7 th Australian Edition, 2004 at 930\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n CADBURY SCHWEPPES PTY LTD v DARRELL LEA CHOCOLATE SHOPS PTY LTD \\n NO.

In Transport Publishing Co Pty Ltd v The Literature Board of Review [1956] HCA 73 ; (1956) 99 CLR 111 at 119 Dixon CJ, Kitto and Taylor JJ said\\n \\n \\\"...it may be said at once that ordinary human nature, that of people at large, is not a subject of proof by evidence, whether supposedly expert or not.\\\"\\n\\n15 As to this, senior counsel for Cadbury submitted:\\n \\n \\\"We are certainly not intending to lead evidence of ordinary human nature but the field of expertise or the area of science which is described as behavioural science is certainly a field of expertise and not a matter of proving ordinary human nature.\\\"\\n\\n16 But with respect, the whole raison d'&ecirc;tre of Dr Gibbs' evidence is to attempt to persuade the Court what ordinary human nature will lead people to do when making purchasing decisions about Darrell Lea chocolates, given the respective packaging, advertising etc of that firm and Cadbury. As the very name of Dr Gibbs' discipline conveys, he is concerned with the science of human behaviour. That is without doubt an area of specialized knowledge. But Transport Publishing says that ordinary human behaviour is not a matter to be proved in courts by opinion evidence, whether expert or otherwise.\\n\\n17 In Transport Publishing (loc cit) their Honours go on to say that \\\"particular descriptions of persons may conceivably form the subject of study and special knowledge\\\". Examples given are persons who are \\\"abnormal in mentality or abnormal in behaviour as a result of circumstances peculiar to their history or situation\\\". Likewise, the manner in which people pursuing a special vocation would reason about a matter of business may be the subject of evidence. An example is that of persons skilled in marine insurance who can give evidence as to the materiality of a non-disclosure. Their Honours then say:\\n \\n \\\"But before opinion evidence may be given upon the characteristics, responses or behaviour of any special category of persons, it must be shown they form a subject of special study or knowledge and only the opinions of one qualified by special training or experience may be received.\\\"\\n\\n18 The second part of that passage of course is echoed in s 79. However, it is clear that this second condition of admissibility assumes that the first has been satisfied, that is to say that the evidence concerns a \\\"special category of persons\\\".\\n\\n22 The present case is concerned with the brand names, colours and get-up of rival manufacturers of chocolate, and the likely effect of those features on retail purchasing decisions by consumers. Chocolate is an inexpensive, everyday product sold in hundreds of thousands of retail outlets throughout this country. Virtually the whole of the Australian population over the age of about eight years are purchasers or potential purchasers. In no way can consumers of chocolate be considered as a \\\"special category of persons\\\" within the meaning of the Transport Publishing rule. The questions thrown up by this case are quintessentially questions of fact within the experience and knowledge of a trier of fact.\",\"12\":\"Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 363 (31 March 2006) \\n\\n [ Home ] [ Databases ] [ WorldLII ] [ Search ] [ Feedback ] Federal Court of Australia You are here: &nbsp; AustLII >> Databases >> Federal Court of Australia >> 2006 >> [2006] FCA 363 \\n\\n [ Database Search ] [ Name Search ] [ Recent Decisions ] [ Noteup ] [ Download ] [ Help ] Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 363 (31 March 2006) \\nLast Updated: 7 April 2006 \\n FEDERAL COURT OF AUSTRALIA \\n\\n Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd \\n [2006] FCA 363 \\n \\n\\n\\n EVIDENCE opinion evidence as to likely consumer behaviour excluded not outside the knowledge and experience of a trier of fact evidence of opinion as to ordinary human nature not admissible alternatively evidence would be excluded on discretionary grounds\\n\\n\\n Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) ss 79 , 135 \\n\\n Makita Australia Pty Ltd v Sprowles Pty Ltd [2001] NSWCA 305 ; (2001) 52 NSWLR 705 at [85] not followed\\n Sydneywide Distributors Pty Ltd v Red Bull Australia Pty Ltd (2002) 55 IPR 354 at [16] followed \\n Neowarra v Western Australia (No 1 ) (2006) FCR 208 at [16], [21]-[27] followed \\n Jango v Northern Territory (No 4) (2004) 214 ALR 608 at [19] followed\\n Ramsay v Watson [1961] HCA 65 ; (1961) 108 CLR 642 at 649 cited\\n R v Turner [1975] QB 834 at 841 followed\\n Murphy v The Queen [1989] HCA 28 ; (1989) 167 CLR 94 at 111 followed\\n Quick v Stoland Pty Ltd (1998) 87 FCR 371 at 382 followed\\n Velevski v The Queen [2002] HCA 4 ; (2002) 187 ALR 233 cited\\n Dalgety Spillers Foods Ltd v Food Brokers Ltd [1994] FSR 504 at 527 cited\\n Symonds Cider & English Wine Company Ltd v Showerings (Ireland) Ltd [1997] 1 IEHC 1 at [20] cited\\n Transport Publishing Co Pty Ltd v The Literature Board of Review [1956] HCA 73 ; (1956) 99 CLR 111 at 119 followed\\n Cat Media Pty Ltd v Opti-Healthcare Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 133 at [55] cited\\n Domain Names Australia Pty Ltd v .au Domain Administration Ltd [2004] FCAFC 247 ; (2004) 139 FCR 215 at [21] cited\\n\\nLigertwood, Australian Evidence , 4 th Edition, 2004 at 494 \\n \\nHeydon, Cross on Evidence , 7 th Australian Edition, 2004 at 930\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n CADBURY SCHWEPPES PTY LTD v DARRELL LEA CHOCOLATE SHOPS PTY LTD \\n NO.

This is not only because there is, as is common in cases of this kind, conflict between the evidence of the two experts. It seems to me that evidence of opinions based on market research and expert appreciation of consumer behaviour will rarely be of assistance in litigation where the Court's primary concern is with the behaviour to be expected of, and the judgments likely to be made by, ordinary (even if it might be thought, somewhat credulous) members of the community intent on making a relatively modest purchase in a conventional way. I endorse the comment of Beaumont J in Pacific Publications Pty Ltd v IPC Media Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 104 at [92] that where a claim is essentially a matter for the Court's impression, expert views which are merely `impressionistic' can be given no more than nominal weight. These observations are not intended in any way to belittle the importance of market research and expert appreciation of consumer behaviour in other types of cases and for other purposes.\\\"\\n\\n23 Senior counsel for Cadbury referred to the assistance he said I could receive from Dr Gibbs' evidence and how it could be helpful. Without wishing to seem ungrateful, or disrespectful to Dr Gibbs, I think the evidence would not be helpful at all. Rather, it would create many areas of disputation with opposing experts and greatly complicate and lengthen the trial of this proceeding. The observations of Branson J in Cat Media are very much in point.\\n\\n24 I rule that the affidavits of Dr Gibbs are not admissible. Were they admissible, I would exercise the discretion under s 135 to refuse to admit them.\\n\\n25 Much of the factual material relied on by Dr Gibbs is not in evidence, or likely to be in evidence, or is vague, tendentious and of little weight. As acknowledged above, such matters go to weight rather than admissibility, but by the same token are relevant in considering probative value for the purposes of s 135.\",\"13\":\"Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 363 (31 March 2006) \\n\\n [ Home ] [ Databases ] [ WorldLII ] [ Search ] [ Feedback ] Federal Court of Australia You are here: &nbsp; AustLII >> Databases >> Federal Court of Australia >> 2006 >> [2006] FCA 363 \\n\\n [ Database Search ] [ Name Search ] [ Recent Decisions ] [ Noteup ] [ Download ] [ Help ] Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 363 (31 March 2006) \\nLast Updated: 7 April 2006 \\n FEDERAL COURT OF AUSTRALIA \\n\\n Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd \\n [2006] FCA 363 \\n \\n\\n\\n EVIDENCE opinion evidence as to likely consumer behaviour excluded not outside the knowledge and experience of a trier of fact evidence of opinion as to ordinary human nature not admissible alternatively evidence would be excluded on discretionary grounds\\n\\n\\n Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) ss 79 , 135 \\n\\n Makita Australia Pty Ltd v Sprowles Pty Ltd [2001] NSWCA 305 ; (2001) 52 NSWLR 705 at [85] not followed\\n Sydneywide Distributors Pty Ltd v Red Bull Australia Pty Ltd (2002) 55 IPR 354 at [16] followed \\n Neowarra v Western Australia (No 1 ) (2006) FCR 208 at [16], [21]-[27] followed \\n Jango v Northern Territory (No 4) (2004) 214 ALR 608 at [19] followed\\n Ramsay v Watson [1961] HCA 65 ; (1961) 108 CLR 642 at 649 cited\\n R v Turner [1975] QB 834 at 841 followed\\n Murphy v The Queen [1989] HCA 28 ; (1989) 167 CLR 94 at 111 followed\\n Quick v Stoland Pty Ltd (1998) 87 FCR 371 at 382 followed\\n Velevski v The Queen [2002] HCA 4 ; (2002) 187 ALR 233 cited\\n Dalgety Spillers Foods Ltd v Food Brokers Ltd [1994] FSR 504 at 527 cited\\n Symonds Cider & English Wine Company Ltd v Showerings (Ireland) Ltd [1997] 1 IEHC 1 at [20] cited\\n Transport Publishing Co Pty Ltd v The Literature Board of Review [1956] HCA 73 ; (1956) 99 CLR 111 at 119 followed\\n Cat Media Pty Ltd v Opti-Healthcare Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 133 at [55] cited\\n Domain Names Australia Pty Ltd v .au Domain Administration Ltd [2004] FCAFC 247 ; (2004) 139 FCR 215 at [21] cited\\n\\nLigertwood, Australian Evidence , 4 th Edition, 2004 at 494 \\n \\nHeydon, Cross on Evidence , 7 th Australian Edition, 2004 at 930\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n CADBURY SCHWEPPES PTY LTD v DARRELL LEA CHOCOLATE SHOPS PTY LTD \\n NO.

In the present case the relevant market is that in which the consumers are business users of domain names. Such users constitute large sections of the public and are not participants in a specialised market in the sense discussed by Lord Diplock.\\\"\\n\\n21 In JD Heydon's Cross on Evidence (7 th Australian ed, 2004) the learned author says at 930:\\n \\n \\\"If the court comes to the conclusion that the subject of investigation does not require a sufficient degree of specialised knowledge to call for the testimony of an expert, evidence of opinion will generally be excluded, especially where the witness is produced merely to present in a cogent and vivid form the case of the party calling that witness. The danger of this evidence is that it dresses up matters which are within the ordinary experience of the tribunal of fact in a beguiling scientific garb which may conceal the blemishes within.\\\"\"}}"
