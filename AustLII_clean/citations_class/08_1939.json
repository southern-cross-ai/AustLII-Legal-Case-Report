The argument before the lower Court was whether the action was one falling within s 116(2)(g). That was rejected by the District Court Judge and not pursued in the Court of Appeal.

If it were otherwise, there would be no need for the Division 4B machinery because the trustee would be entitled to the bankrupt's income and wages. The Act continues to recognise the principle enunciated by Dixon J in Nette v Howarth [1935] HCA 22 ; 53 CLR 55 and recognises, as the law has since 1785, that income and earnings do not form part of the bankrupt's estate: Chippendall v Tomlinson (1785) L Co Bank L 428 per Lord Mansfield at 432; and 99 ER 900 at 902.\\n\\n76 The right to seek a review of the respondent's decision to terminate the applicant's employment remains with the applicant. The trustee has no interest in seeking a review of that decision. The trustee, for example, could not ensure that if the decision were reversed that the applicant would resume employment. If the trustee was interested in the proceeding and brought the proceeding and the decision was quashed as the applicant seeks in this proceeding, there would be no property in the result which would be divisible among the applicant's creditors. The right to seek an order quashing the decision of the respondent to terminate the applicant's employment is not a right which can be exercised beneficially for the creditors, even in circumstances where the applicant seeks the further orders which may result in a sum of money being paid to him by way of compensation. Whether if the bankrupt received compensation that money would become after-acquired property for which he would have to account to his trustee does not need to be determined on this application: see Chippendall v Tomlinson (1785) L Co Bank L 428; 99 ER 900.\",\"5\":\"23 The respondents argued that the concept of property is a very broad one and has to be understood in light of the principle that the creditors are to have the benefit of \\\"every beneficial interest which the bankrupt has, every species of right or which by any possibility of profit can be made\\\": Cirillo v City Corp Australia [2004] SASC 293 at [78] (citing re Buckle (1969) 15 FLR 460 at 466).\\n\\n24 The respondents contended that the applicant's proceeding falls within s 116(1)(b) and thus s 58 because the proceeding involves the capacity to exercise powers in respect of property as might have been exercised by the bankrupt for his own benefit.

At the same time as the property vests the bankrupt's creditors lose the right to recover their debts from the bankrupt in exchange for a right to prove their debts in the administration of the bankrupt's estate: s 58(3) ; Clyne v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [1984] HCA 44 ; (1984) 154 CLR 589 at 594.

An action of that kind must be an action in which the damages claimed are assessed by reference \\\"to pain felt by the bankrupt in respect of his mind, body or character and without reference to his rights of property\\\": Cox v Journeaux [1935] HCA 48 ; (1935) 52 CLR 713 at 721.\\n\\n39 Section 116(2)(g) completes the excision from the bankrupt's estate by excluding from property divisible among the bankrupt's creditors the right to recover damages or compensation for actions of the kind in s 60(4) and specifically excludes any damages or compensation recovered for proceedings of that kind from the property of the bankrupt divisible among the bankrupt's creditors.\\n\\n40 Section 60(4) and s 116(2)(g) must be understood as allowing the bankrupt to retain a right to bring action and a right to retain damages of property that would be otherwise property divisible among the bankrupt's creditors. In other words, but for s 60(4) and s 116(2)(g), an action to recover damages for personal injury or wrong done to the bankrupt or his or her family and for damages or compensation recovered would be property divisible among the bankrupt's creditors.\",\"8\":\"29 The applicant contended that in Cummings v Claremont Petroleum NL [1996] HCA 19 ; (1996) 185 CLR 124 , the majority of the High Court held that the right to appeal against a money judgment was not property within the meaning of the definition in the Bankruptcy Act . At p 133 Brennan CJ, Gaudron and McHugh JJ said:\\n A right to appeal may be a substantive right, but it is another question whether such a right has the character of property. Some rights created by statute can constitute property, but a right to appeal does not have the character of properly merely because it is the creature of statute. A chose in action may be the property of the person entitled to enforce it, but a liability to satisfy a judgment enforcing a chose in action is not property of the person against whom the judgment is entered. A liability is not property of the person liable. Nor is a right to appeal against a money judgment property of the judgment debtor. Nor does such a right to appeal answer the description of property divisible among creditors defined by s 116(1)(b) , namely, \\\"the capacity to exercise, and to take proceedings for exercising all such powers in, over or in respect of property as might have been exercised by the bankrupt for his own benefit\\\". (Footnotes omitted.)\\n\\n30 The applicant submitted that the question on this application is whether the right to bring an application for judicial review and consequential relief in relation to a decision to terminate a bankrupt's employment is property within the meaning of s 5 of the Bankruptcy Act and, more particularly, is property divisible among the bankrupt's creditors within the meaning of s 116(1)(b) of that Act.\\n\\n31 The applicant relied upon Cummings [1996] HCA 19 ; 185 CLR 124 and Griffiths v Civil Aviation Authority (1996) 67 FCR 301 , being a decision of the Full Court of this Court in which the Court held that a proceeding in the Federal Court pursuant to s 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act to challenge a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal was not property divisible among the creditors of the appellant's estate vesting in the trustee of that estate.\\n\\n35 The purpose of the Bankruptcy Act is to ensure that all of the bankrupt's property, both real and personal at the time of the sequestration order and any property acquired by the bankrupt after the sequestration order, vests in the bankrupt's trustee in order that it is available to be divided among the bankrupt's creditors. At the same time as the property vests the bankrupt's creditors lose the right to recover their debts from the bankrupt in exchange for a right to prove their debts in the administration of the bankrupt's estate: s 58(3) ; Clyne v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [1984] HCA 44 ; (1984) 154 CLR 589 at 594.

But an exception was absolutely necessary in order that the bankrupt might not be an outlaw, a mere slave to his trustee; he could not be prevented from earning his own living. On that principle the trustee could not sue for moneys due to the bankrupt in respect of his personal labour, and, if the bankrupt could sue for them only for the benefit of his trustee, he would really be without remedy.\\n\\n43 In those circumstances, the kinds of action contemplated by s 60(4) and s 116(2)(g) do not assist in determining whether the right to bring this proceeding is property divisible among the bankrupt's creditors. This is not a proceeding of the kind contemplated by s 60(4) or s 116(2)(g). The question must be answered by reference to whether a proceeding of the kind brought by the applicant is property divisible among the bankrupt's creditors. That question must be addressed by reference to s 116(1).\\n\\n44 This proceeding is for an order quashing the respondents' decision to terminate the applicant's employment by reason of a failure by the second respondent to accord the applicant procedural fairness and by the improper exercise of power.\",\"11\":\"62 In Federal Commissioner of Taxation v The Official Receiver [1956] HCA 24 ; (1956) 95 CLR 300 , the High Court was concerned with the precursor to s 131 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 , viz s 101 of the Bankruptcy Act 1924-1950 (Cth) (the 1924 Bankruptcy Act ). In that case, the bankrupt was entitled to a sum of money from the Federal Commissioner of Taxation which represented an income refund for overpayment of taxation on income earned by the bankrupt. The income had been paid by the bankrupt's employer to the Federal Commissioner of Taxation under the Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Assessment Act 1936-1953 (Cth). The Official Receiver claimed to be entitled to the refund.\\n\\n63 Section 91 of the 1924 Bankruptcy Act relevantly provided:\\n the property of the bankrupt divisible among his creditors, and in this Act referred to as \\\"the property of the bankrupt\\\" shall ... subject to this Act ... include--(i) all property which belongs to or is vested in the bankrupt at the commencement of bankruptcy, or is acquired by or devolves on him before his discharge.\\n\\n64 Section 101 relevantly provided:\\n Subject to this Act, where a bankrupt is in receipt of pay, pension, salary, emoluments, profits, wages, earnings or income, the trustee shall receive for distribution amongst the creditors so much thereof as the Court, on the application of the trustee directs: Provided that this section shall not apply to any pay, pension, salary or wages which by any Act or State Act is made exempt from attachment or incapable of being assigned or charged.\",\"12\":\"25 They contended that the exceptions in s 116(2), and in particular s 116(2)(g), do not apply.

In that case, the appellant, who was a bankrupt, sued the respondent for money said to be due under a contract of employment or for damages for breach of contract arising out of wrongful dismissal. The District Court Judge dismissed the proceeding on the ground that the cause of action had vested in the Official Trustee. The bankrupt appealed but the appeal was dismissed on the ground that an action for damages for wrongful dismissal (not including services actually rendered) vests in the Official Trustee. The Court of Appeal distinguished such claims from contracts for personal service which do not vest in the Official Trustee.\\n\\n33 The applicant contended that the decision in Geia 152 FLR 135 was an action claiming damages on the basis of wrongful dismissal. The issue before the Court of Appeal, it was said, was not whether such an action was property within the meaning of the Act but whether the action could be said to be impliedly exempt by reason of \\\"the common law of bankruptcy\\\".\\n\\n79 I also agree, with respect, with the decision of the Full Bench of the New South Wales Industrial Relations Commission in Perfection Dairies Pty Ltd v Finn [2006] NSW IR Comm 137. In that case, the appellant before the Commission had summarily dismissed the respondent from employment for wilful misconduct. A Commissioner had ordered the respondent be reinstated and that the appellant pay the respondent an amount which equated to the remuneration he would have received but for the dismissal. One of the issues raised on that appeal was whether the respondent, as an undischarged bankrupt, had standing to bring the application for reinstatement. The Commission, after referring to the sections of the Bankruptcy Act to which reference has been made in these reasons and after referring to the dicta of Cooper J in Griffiths v Civil Aviation Authority 67 FCR 301 , to which I have also made reference, and the judgment of the Queensland Court of Appeal in Geia v Palm Island Aboriginal Council 152 FLR 135, said at [38]-[39]:\\n Employment is not usually referred to, or known as, property. Whatever legal \\\"interest\\\" an employee has in his or her employment, it is not a property interest. In any event, it seems clear from reference to the relevant statutory provisions and the case law that, although the expression \\\"property\\\", and cognate expressions such as \\\"the property of the bankrupt\\\" and \\\"after acquired property\\\", are to be construed in a very wide sense, the bankrupt's employment is not considered \\\"property\\\" for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act . Indeed, all the pertinent indications in the statute and the case law are to the opposite effect. For example, there are a number of references in the Bankruptcy Act to \\\"property divisible among the bankrupt's creditors\\\" (see, for example, s 58(6) and the definition of \\\"the property of the bankrupt\\\" in s 5) ; it could not seriously be suggested that the bankrupt's employment, or the bankrupt's rights as to his or her employment could be divisible among the creditors. Indeed, the statute recognises that it is most desirable that the bankrupt be able to earn income during the course of the bankruptcy and also contemplates the likelihood that a bankrupt who was an employee prior to the bankruptcy would continue to be in employment. The references we have cited from division 4B of the statute, including the references to ss 139L and 139U are also in point. In particular, we do not detect in the scheme of the Australian statute any provision which would be at odds with the observation in the judgment of the English Court of Appeal in Ex part Vine ; re Wilson, where reference was made to the necessary exception to the property of the bankrupt being divisible amongst his creditors, \\\"in order that the bankrupt might not be an outlaw, a mere slave to his trustee; he could not be prevented from earning his living\\\".\\n\\n81 In Geia v Palm Island Aboriginal Council 152 FLR 135 the bankrupt sued for damages for breach of contract or for moneys due and payable under a contract of employment.

As such, it does not address the issues raised in these reasons.\\n\\n84 The application to dismiss or stay the applicant's proceeding on the ground that the applicant lacked standing is dismissed.\\n\\n85 The respondents sought, if their first application was dismissed, security for costs.\",\"14\":\"31 The applicant relied upon Cummings [1996] HCA 19 ; 185 CLR 124 and Griffiths v Civil Aviation Authority (1996) 67 FCR 301 , being a decision of the Full Court of this Court in which the Court held that a proceeding in the Federal Court pursuant to s 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act to challenge a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal was not property divisible among the creditors of the appellant's estate vesting in the trustee of that estate.\\n\\n77 The holding that an application of this kind is not property of the bankrupt which vests in the trustee is consistent with the decision of the Full Court of this Court in Griffiths v Civil Aviation Authority 67 FCR 301 where the Full Court held that an appeal to the Federal Court on a question of law from the decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in relation to conditions imposed upon a bankrupt on aviation licences was not property of the bankrupt which vested in the trustee. Cooper J said in that case at 325-326:\\n \\n \\n There is a unity of object and purpose in the operation of ss 58, 60 and 116 of the Act if it is recognised that the consistent focus of attention is upon rights which the trustee can turn to advantage for the benefit of creditors or upon rights the exercise of which will adversely affect or delay the administration of the estate. It is these rights which fall within the definition of \\\"property\\\" in s 5 and the enforcement of which by action are stayed by s 60(2) upon a person becoming bankrupt. To interpret \\\"property\\\" for the purposes of s 5 in this way avoids the injustice of denying to the bankrupt the power to exercise a right in which the trustee has no interest and the exercise of which cannot operate adversely on the property of the bankrupt or the administration of the bankrupt's estate.\\n \\n The right of Mr Griffiths to appeal to this Court from the decision of the Tribunal and his right to appeal from the judgment of Kiefel J are such rights and did not vest in the Official Trustee upon acquisition by Mr Griffiths. Neither Mr Griffiths' appeal from the Tribunal to the original jurisdiction of this Court, nor his appeal from the order of Kiefel J to the Full Court is incompetent in consequence of his bankruptcy.\\n\\n78 The right to sue for the bankrupt's earnings, wages or income does not vest in the trustee and therefore the right is exercisable by the applicant.\\n\\n79 I also agree, with respect, with the decision of the Full Bench of the New South Wales Industrial Relations Commission in Perfection Dairies Pty Ltd v Finn [2006] NSW IR Comm 137.

In those circumstances, unless an order were made under s 131(2) the bankrupt's income was not property of the bankrupt and not divisible among the bankrupt's creditors.\\n\\n57 What is important for the purpose of this application is that the Act continues to recognise, as s 131 previously did, that the bankrupt's income is not part of the bankrupt's property except to the extent that a contribution is made. If it were otherwise, there would be no need for the Division 4B machinery because the trustee would be entitled to the bankrupt's income and wages. The Act continues to recognise the principle enunciated by Dixon J in Nette v Howarth [1935] HCA 22 ; 53 CLR 55 and recognises, as the law has since 1785, that income and earnings do not form part of the bankrupt's estate: Chippendall v Tomlinson (1785) L Co Bank L 428 per Lord Mansfield at 432; and 99 ER 900 at 902.\\n\\n67 Williams J then referred to Dixon J's dicta in Nette v Howarth [1935] HCA 22 ; 53 CLR 55 cited above and said (at 315):\\n These and other cases cited to us establish that the question whether any part and if so what part of the personal earnings of a bankrupt vests in the official receiver as after-acquired property is really academic. If the official receiver claims any part of these earnings, he must apply to the Bankruptcy Court for an order. He must intervene in this specific manner. In the absence of such an order the bankrupt is free to dispose of the whole of these earnings.\\n\\n68 Fullagar J said (at 320):\\n In the case of personal earnings after bankruptcy, I am of opinion that, whatever may be the position under the English Act, under the Australian Act the only way in which the trustee can effectively \\\"intervene\\\" is by making an application for an order under s. 101.\\n\\n69 He then discussed the manner in which the Commissioner of Taxation received the sum and how the Commission became obliged to pay that sum to the bankrupt. He said (at 322):\\n The right to receive this sum of \\u20a444 6s. 3d. really is a right to receive money which the bankrupt earned. How else did he acquire the right to payment of that sum? It is not the price of an article sold by him, or an instalment of the rent of a house let by him, or a dividend on shares owned by him. His right to payment arises because, and only because, he worked for a remuneration which is found, on a contingency which was contemplated throughout, not to have been paid to him in full. For these reasons I am of opinion that the sum in question does represent personal earnings of the bankrupt, and that the respondent has no right in respect of that sum unless he can obtain an order under s. 101 of the Bankruptcy Act .\",\"19\":\"87 The general rule is that where the applicant is a natural person he or she will not be required to provide security for costs merely because he or she is impecunious: Pearson v Naydler [1977] 3 All ER 531 at 533 per Megarrey VC. That said, however, it is necessary to have regard to the circumstances of the case generally to determine whether the case is an appropriate one for an order for security for costs.\\n\\n88 The applicant is a bankrupt. After his bankruptcy he obtained employment with the first respondent and during the course of his bankruptcy his employment with the first respondent was terminated.\\n\\n89 Although there is no direct evidence, having regard to the proceeding itself, it may be inferred that the applicant has not been employed since his employment was terminated on 16 May 2008.\",\"20\":\"27 The respondents also relied upon a decision of Madgwick J in Pelechowski v NSW Land and Housing Commission [2000] FCA 233. In that case, the applicant, who was a bankrupt, applied to the Industrial Relations Court for reinstatement as a result of unlawful termination of his employment by the first respondent. Madgwick J found that the trustee had not elected to prosecute the action (s 60(2)) and so the action was deemed to have been abandoned (s 60(3)).\\n\\n28 The applicant contended that the question is whether the proceeding is after-acquired property within the meaning of s 58(6). Section 58(6) provides:\\n 58(6) In this section, after-acquired property, in relation to a bankrupt, means property that is acquired by, or devolves on, the bankrupt on or after the date of the bankruptcy, being property that is divisible amongst the creditors of the bankrupt.\\n\\n34 The applicant contended that insofar as the respondents relied on Pelechowski v New South Wales Land and Housing Commission [2000] FCA 233 , that proceeding had been commenced before the making of the sequestration order which meant that the action was caught by s 60(2) of the Act. To that extent, it was contended it was not in point.\\n\\n80 Madgwick J's decision in Pelechowski v NSW Land and Housing Commission [2000] FCA 233 addressed only the question whether the action was for a personal injury which was the only live issue because of the provisions of s 60(2). The action in that case was commenced before the sequestration order was made and was caught by s 60(2). Section 60(2) catches all actions not excepted by s 60(4). There was no question in that proceeding whether income, wages or earnings payable to the bankrupt after bankruptcy was property of the bankrupt or property divisible among the bankrupt's creditors.\",\"21\":\"32 The applicant also relied upon a decision of the Industrial Relations Commission of New South Wales in Perfection Dairies Pty Ltd v Finn [2006] NSW IR Comm 137 in which the Commission comprising Wright J, Staff J and Stanton C held that employment is not property for the purpose of the Bankruptcy Act .\\n\\n79 I also agree, with respect, with the decision of the Full Bench of the New South Wales Industrial Relations Commission in Perfection Dairies Pty Ltd v Finn [2006] NSW IR Comm 137. In that case, the appellant before the Commission had summarily dismissed the respondent from employment for wilful misconduct. A Commissioner had ordered the respondent be reinstated and that the appellant pay the respondent an amount which equated to the remuneration he would have received but for the dismissal. One of the issues raised on that appeal was whether the respondent, as an undischarged bankrupt, had standing to bring the application for reinstatement. The Commission, after referring to the sections of the Bankruptcy Act to which reference has been made in these reasons and after referring to the dicta of Cooper J in Griffiths v Civil Aviation Authority 67 FCR 301 , to which I have also made reference, and the judgment of the Queensland Court of Appeal in Geia v Palm Island Aboriginal Council 152 FLR 135, said at [38]-[39]:\\n Employment is not usually referred to, or known as, property. Whatever legal \\\"interest\\\" an employee has in his or her employment, it is not a property interest. In any event, it seems clear from reference to the relevant statutory provisions and the case law that, although the expression \\\"property\\\", and cognate expressions such as \\\"the property of the bankrupt\\\" and \\\"after acquired property\\\", are to be construed in a very wide sense, the bankrupt's employment is not considered \\\"property\\\" for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act . Indeed, all the pertinent indications in the statute and the case law are to the opposite effect. For example, there are a number of references in the Bankruptcy Act to \\\"property divisible among the bankrupt's creditors\\\" (see, for example, s 58(6) and the definition of \\\"the property of the bankrupt\\\" in s 5) ; it could not seriously be suggested that the bankrupt's employment, or the bankrupt's rights as to his or her employment could be divisible among the creditors. Indeed, the statute recognises that it is most desirable that the bankrupt be able to earn income during the course of the bankruptcy and also contemplates the likelihood that a bankrupt who was an employee prior to the bankruptcy would continue to be in employment. The references we have cited from division 4B of the statute, including the references to ss 139L and 139U are also in point. In particular, we do not detect in the scheme of the Australian statute any provision which would be at odds with the observation in the judgment of the English Court of Appeal in Ex part Vine ; re Wilson, where reference was made to the necessary exception to the property of the bankrupt being divisible amongst his creditors, \\\"in order that the bankrupt might not be an outlaw, a mere slave to his trustee; he could not be prevented from earning his living\\\".\",\"22\":\"72 Section 131 has been repealed. However, the Bankruptcy Act still contemplates that income earned after the bankrupt's bankruptcy does not vest in the bankrupt's trustee: Re Gillies [1993] FCA 289 ; (1993) 115 ALR 631 at 636-637. Whilst the trustee may require the bankrupt to make contributions out of the bankrupt's income, the Bankruptcy Act contemplates that those contributions will be made out of income in the hands of the bankrupt not the trustee.\\n\\n73 The position therefore is no different from the position when s 131 was part of the Bankruptcy Act or s 101 part of the 1924 Bankruptcy Act . The bankrupt's income, after bankruptcy, does not vest in the bankrupt's trustee.\\n\\n74 If the bankrupt's income does not vest in the trustee, it must be because it is not property or at least property divisible among the bankrupt's creditors.\\n\\n82 The Court went on to say:\\n A convenient summary of these provisions is to be found in the reasons of French J in Re Gillies; Ex parte Official Receiver in Bankruptcy [1993] FCA 289 ; (1993) 42 FCR 571. In that case his Honour held that although s 131(1) which had entitled \\\"a bankrupt who is in receipt of income\\\" to retain it for his own benefit had been repealed, Div 4B \\\"rests upon the continuing assumption that the income of the bankrupt does not vest in the trustee\\\". We are in respectful agreement with that view; but it does not, of course, bear upon the question whether a cause of action for breach of a contract which would, if carried out, have produced income for the bankrupt vests in the trustee.\",\"23\":\"75 In those circumstances, the trustee cannot sue for wages or income due to the bankrupt because those wages or that income have not vested in the trustee: Williams v Chambers [1847] EngR 300 ; (1847) 10 QB 335; 116 ER 130. Indeed, even if the Court ordered (under the repealed s 131) or the trustee assessed contributions payable by the bankrupt to the trustee, no right to recover that sum or those sums vests in the trustee against the employer. The liability to pay that sum or those sums is imposed upon the bankrupt.\"}}"
