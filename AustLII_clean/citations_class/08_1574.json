She said at [8]:\\n The following matters, which are not intended to comprise an exhaustive list, seem to me to be considerations to which the Court may appropriately have regard in determining whether particular conduct calls for the imposition of a penalty, and assuming that it does, the amount of the penalty: \\n \\n \\n (a) The circumstances in which the relevant conduct took place (including whether the conduct was undertaken in deliberate defiance or disregard of the Act).\\n \\n (b) Whether the respondent has previously been found to have engaged in conduct in contravention of Pt XA of the Act.\\n \\n (c) Where more than one contravention of Pt XA is involved, whether the various contraventions are properly seen as distinct or whether they arise out of the one course of conduct.\\n \\n (d) The consequences of the conduct found to be in contravention of Pt XA of the Act.\\n \\n (e) The need, in the circumstances, for the protection of industrial freedom of association.\\n \\n (f) The need, in the circumstances, for deterrence.\",\"1\":\"15 In CPSU v Telstra Corporation (2001) 108 IR 228, Finkelstein J said at [8] that the objects of imposing a pecuniary penalty may include punishment, deterrence or rehabilitation, or a combination of all three.\\n\\n16 I do not think in the case of a contravention of s 285E rehabilitation plays any real part. I think punishment plays some part in the purpose for the imposition of a penalty, but I think it plays a lesser part than aspects of deterrence. In my opinion, the principal reason for the imposition of a penalty in relation to a contravention of s 285E of the Act is deterrence. The purpose of the civil penalty is to deter persons, who have been given a right to enter premises by virtue of ss 285B and 285C, from intentionally hindering or obstructing any other employer or employee. In speaking of deterrence, I am speaking of both general and personal deterrence. The purpose of the penalty is to deter the particular person from further contraventions of the section and to deter other like minded persons who might otherwise commit a contravention of s 285E.\\n\\n17 The Act also seeks to deter persons who hold a permit from contravening s 285E(1) by empowering the Registrar to revoke the contravenor's permit if the Registrar is satisfied that a contravention has occurred: s 285A(3). In considering the appropriate penalty I have taken into account that the finding of a contravention may put the respondent's permit at risk. It was contended by the respondent's counsel that if the respondent lost his permit the respondent may either lose or his job or be forced to take leave during the time when the respondent was without a permit. It was put that the permit was an essential aspect of his employment. However, the respondent's counsel was not able to say that either of those consequences would follow if the respondent were to lose his permit or have it suspended for any length of time. The risk of those events occurring ought to be taken into account but, in the circumstances of this case and in the absence of any evidence from the employer, I do not put great weight upon those risks.\",\"2\":\"10 In NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [1996] FCA 1134 ; (1996) 71 FCR 285 at 290-291, Burchett and Kiefel JJ (with whom Carr J generally agreed) discussed the question of the Court's role on fixing the quantum of penalty in circumstances where the parties had indicated a range within which a civil penalty ought to be imposed. That decision has been more recently considered in Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd [2004] FCAFC 72 ; [2004] ATPR 41 and the Court distilled the proposition which emerged from the reasoning in NW Frozen Foods [1996] FCA 1134 ; 71 FCR 285 at [51] :\\n The following propositions emerge from the reasoning in NW Frozen Foods: \\n \\n \\n (i) It is the responsibility of the Court to determine the appropriate penalty to be imposed under s 76 of the TP Act in respect of a contravention of the TP Act. \\n \\n (ii) Determining the quantum of a penalty is not an exact science. Within a permissible range, the courts have acknowledged that a particular figure cannot necessarily be said to be more appropriate than another.\\n \\n (iii) There is a public interest in promoting settlement of litigation, particularly where it is likely to be lengthy. Accordingly, when the regulator and contravenor have reached agreement, they may present to the Court a statement of facts and opinions as to the effect of those facts, together with joint submissions as to the appropriate penalty to be imposed.\\n \\n (iv) The view of the regulator, as a specialist body, is a relevant, but not determinative consideration on the question of penalty. In particular, the views of the regulator on matters within its expertise (such as the ACCC's views as to the deterrent effect of a proposed penalty in a given market) will usually be given greater weight than its views on more \\\"subjective\\\" matters.\\n \\n (v) In determining whether the proposed penalty is appropriate, the Court examines all the circumstances of the case. Where the parties have put forward an agreed statement of facts, the Court may act on that statement if it is appropriate to do so.\\n \\n (vi) Where the parties have jointly proposed a penalty, it will not be useful to investigate whether the Court would have arrived at that precise figure in the absence of agreement. The question is whether that figure is, in the Court's view, appropriate in the circumstances of the case. In answering that question, the Court will not reject the agreed figure simply because it would have been disposed to select some other figure.

Those facts speak for themselves.\\n\\n19 \\n \\nIn considering what ought to be the appropriate penalty, one must have regard to the seriousness of the contravention. The more serious the contravention, the higher the penalty.\\n\\n20 For the reasons which I have given, I consider that the conduct was serious. The conduct was premeditated and was designed to hinder the contractor and the subcontractor in the carrying out of their work on the day in question. The conduct continued over a relatively long period. The conduct had the consequence that Mr Zito and his employees had to work late into the evening to complete their concreting.\"}}"
