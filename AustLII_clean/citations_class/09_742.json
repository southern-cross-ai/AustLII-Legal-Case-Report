His Honour posed the question as being which of two theories is correct: the theory that tenants' fixtures never become part of the freehold (his Honour referred to Mowats v Hudson (1911) 105 LT 400) , and the theory that they do but are subject to the tenant's right to detach them and thereby make them chattels again (his Honour referred to Horwitch v Symond (1914) 110 LT 106 (affirmed by the Court of Appeal (1915) 84 LJKB 1083)).\",\"6\":\"In Lees & Leech Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1997) 73 FCR 136 , Hill J said (at 149): \\n ...When it is said that an item is a \\\"tenants' fixture\\\", all that is meant is that the tenant has a right to remove the item at the expiration of the term of the lease or a reasonable time thereafter: cf D'Arcy v Burelli Investments Pty Ltd (1987) 8 NSWLR 317. If the item in question were not a fixture, a fortiori it would belong to the tenant and could be removed by the tenant at any time. Thus, the whole concept of tenants' fixtures assumes that the items in question have become fixtures but that the tenant has a right in equity in the land, co-extensive with the right of the tenant to come upon the land after the expiration of the lease and remove the fixture.\\n\\nThe expression \\\"tenants' fixtures\\\" is apt to mislead unless adequately explained. The tenant does not own the freehold and a fixture does not belong to the tenant by virtue of being part of the freehold. Rather, fixtures are the property of the owner of the land, but in the case of \\\"tenants' fixtures\\\" they are subject to the tenant's right to remove them during the term of the lease or within a reasonable time thereafter and so convert them back into chattels.\\n\\nUnder the general law, for the purposes of the limited exception to the quicquid plantatur maxim in favour of tenants' fixtures, the latter are things installed by a tenant for trade, domestic or ornamental purposes. If it matters, the fixtures with which I am concerned were all installed by NFD for the purpose of its trade. It may not matter because the right of removal is regulated by the Sublease which speaks generally of NFD's fixtures without reference to their purpose. In any event, so far as the evidence reveals, there were no fixtures installed by NFD for any purpose other than trade.\",\"7\":\"This submission raises indirectly a question that was referred to by Young CJ in Eq (as Young JA then was) in Eye Corp Australia Pty Ltd v Goliath Investments Pty Ltd (2006) 12 BPR 23, 949; [2006] NSWSC 159 at [26] [27].

All members of the High Court agreed that they were fixtures and were not within a proviso in the Second Schedule to the Stamp Duties Act 1920 (NSW) that exempted from stamp duty an agreement for the sale of \\\"goods, wares or merchandise\\\". This was so notwithstanding that under the gas company's Act of Parliament the mains and pipes remained the property of the company which was given express power to remove, alter, repair, replace or relay them. Dixon J (as the Chief Justice then was) said (at 67 68): \\n The question for decision is, I think, whether the pipes and mains, considered as in situ and as part of such an undertaking, have no longer the quality of chattels personal. It must be steadily borne in mind that the agreement relates to the undertaking as a going concern. It contemplates a transfer of the mains and services as they lie in the ground; not as separate or detachable articles, but as an integral part of an undivided plant or system and actually in use. \\n\\n \\n Ordinarily when the chattel elements by which a permanent system or apparatus is formed are assembled and embedded in the soil or established as part of a building they lose their independent nature and for the purpose of the law take on the character of land. Thus, if the land in which the mains were laid had belonged to the company for an estate in fee simple or for any less estate or interest and the company had not acted under its special statutory powers, the mains until removed would have formed part of the realty. ... \\n\\n \\n The primary consequence of so fixing such things in the soil that they are treated as forming part of it is that ownership of the articles follows ownership of the land. Though removable tenants' fixtures may during the term be detached and become chattels belonging to the tenant, yet the better opinion appears to be that unless and until the tenant exercises his right of removal they form part of the realty... and for this reason, subject to the exercise of the tenant's right to convert them again into chattels, pass with the land.\\n\\nWhether personal property has become part of real property by virtue of being a fixture is not a matter of the subjective intention of the affixer. If we must speak in terms of intention, the only relevant intention is one that is objectively \\\"presumed\\\" from the manner, degree and object of affixation.\",\"11\":\"The second basis of the Court's jurisdiction is this: such claims as the Administrators assert on behalf of NFD depend upon their status as DOCA administrators under Pt 5.3A of the Act, and those claims, either alone or together with Vopak's own claim, constitute a \\\"matter\\\" arising under a law of the Commonwealth Parliament: see Re Wakim; Ex parte McNally [1999] HCA 27 ; (1999) 198 CLR 511 at [135] [147]; Austral Pacific Group Ltd (in liq) v Airservices Australia [2000] HCA 39 ; (2000) 203 CLR 136 at [10] .\",\"12\":\"In Vopak Terminals Australia Pty Ltd v Commissioner of State Revenue [2004] VSCA 10 ; (2004) 12 VR 351 , it was decided for Victorian stamp duty purposes that certain petroleum storage tanks and other structures on leased premises were not fixtures.

It was held that this provision produced the result that eight storage tanks and other structures which, it was common ground, were fixtures under general law principles, were deprived of that characterisation by the statutory provision.\\n\\nThe case is distinguishable as turning on the statutory provision.
