Hely J also recognised that while the policy of the law favours the sensible compromise of disputes, there was also a policy against deterring parties from pursuing claims to which they reasonably believed themselves entitled ( Braverus 212 ALR at 289-290 [46]). I am also of opinion that the policy of the law entitles the parties to pursue defences against claims in circumstances where they reasonably believe they cannot achieve a compromise on commercially acceptable grounds.\\n\\n36 Here, the plaintiffs were seeking to keep their options open in the offers on which they rely. The defendants did not have to accept that stance. The absence of any clear offer capable of acceptance which would have resolved the whole dispute, other than those which the defendants were reasonably entitled not to accept, leads me to conclude that I should dismiss the application for indemnity costs.\\n I certify that the preceding thirty six (36) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Rares. \\n\\n Associate:\\nDated: 28 February 2007\\n\\n Counsel for the Plaintiffs: Mr F Lever SC with Mr R Alkadamani Solicitor for the Plaintiffs: Haywards Solicitors \\n \\n Counsel for the Defendants: Mr S Reuben with Mr D Jarrett Solicitor for the Defendants: Cordato Partners Date of Hearing:\\nDate of Judgment: 14, 19 February 2007\\n28 February 2007 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2007\\/220.html\",\"2\":\"33 During the course of oral argument the plaintiffs referred to the decision of Rogers CJ in Comm D in the Supreme Court of New South Wales in Singleton v Macquarie Broadcasting Holdings Ltd (unreported, 22 November 1989; BC8902891). There, no offer of settlement had been made under the provisions of the then Pt 22 of the Supreme Court Rules 1970 (NSW) or in the form of a Calderbank letter. However, the plaintiffs there had offered to settle for a sum which was less than ultimately they were found to be entitled to receive. Rogers CJ in Comm D said that during the course of the proceedings it became apparent that the defendant had sought to put in the forefront of its resistance to the plaintiffs' claims an argument or defence that should have been perceived as unsustainable on the evidentiary material (BC8902891 at 12). He pointed out that the provisions in the Court's rules gave substantial guidance on the question of whether an order for indemnity costs should be made. The Chief Judge said (BC8902891 at 16):\\n \\n 'Where, prior to the hearing, a party offers to settle on a basis of an amount less than that ultimately recovered, then, all other things being equal, costs incurred thereafter may be appropriate on an indemnity scale.'\\n\\n34 While I agree with that expression of principle, the plaintiffs here are unable to point to any offer which they put forward which it was unreasonable for the defendants not to have accepted. Indeed, the only offers on which the plaintiffs rely are the terms of the draft deeds as negotiated and the course of negotiations up to 11 January 2006.\",\"3\":\"10 The Court has power in equity and under the Act to set aside a resolution made in circumstances where there has been a fraud on a power by the members ( Ngurli Ltd v McCann [1953] HCA 39 ; (1953) 90 CLR 425 at 438-439 per Williams ACJ, Fullagar and Kitto JJ) or by directors (e.g. Whitehouse v Carlton Hotel Pty Ltd [1987] HCA 11 ; (1987) 162 CLR 285 at 289-290, 293-294 per Mason, Deane and Dawson JJ).
