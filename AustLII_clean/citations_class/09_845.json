Having considered the reasons of the primary judge in relation to the construction and operation of s 459S of the Corporations Act , I am satisfied that there is no error reflected in his Honour's approach to the authorities and his Honour's approach to the construction and application of s 459S of the Corporations Act .\",\"4\":\"In addition to the question of construction of the relevant provision of the Act, his Honour also turned to some of the affidavit material and the facts reflected in those affidavits. At [10] of the primary judge's reasons in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Neo Rock Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 129 on 12 February 2009, the primary judge said this: \\n The evidence lead on behalf of Neo Rock on the application is noteworthy for its absence of reference to the overall financial position of that company. There is no evidence which touches upon the assets and liabilities of the company generally, its profit and loss, its balance sheet, or its solvency, either having regard to the debt as it presently stands (which has its origins in that which supported the statutory demand) or otherwise howsoever. The focus of the affidavit material which has been read is on dealings as between Neo Rock and the Australian Taxation Office (the ATO) in the context of an as yet unresolved audit of that company's taxation affairs by the ATO.\\n\\nThe primary judge noted that the company had engaged a chartered accountant, Mr Vicca, to assist the company with the task of bringing its business activity statements up to date. Mr Vicca expressed certain opinions about the balance debt due to the Deputy Commissioner. The Deputy Commissioner in response filed affidavit material which suggested that the present indebtedness of the company to the Deputy Commissioner and therefore payable as a debt due to the Commonwealth was $24,132.01. The company contests aspects of that assertion and did so before the primary judge. The primary judge also noted at [13] that the company had failed to lodge income tax returns for the financial years ending 30 June 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008.\\n\\nThe primary judge concluded at [14]: \\n It is not a satisfactory state of affairs for a company, faced with an application for its winding up in respect of a debt which it has not contested in the way provided for when a statutory demand was issued, to seek an indefinite adjournment of a winding up application on the strength of what is, in substance, an assertion unfocussed on the subject of proof of the solvency of the company.\"}}"
