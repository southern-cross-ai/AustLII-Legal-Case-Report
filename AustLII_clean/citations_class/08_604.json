His Honour said:\\n \\n \\n \\\"[31] In order to prove a civil contempt of court involving a breach of an order of the court, the plaintiff has to prove the following: \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n (i) that an order was made by the court; \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n (ii) that the terms of the order are clear, unambiguous and capable of compliance; \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n (iii) that the order was served on the alleged contemnor or excused in the circumstances, or service dispensed with pursuant to the Rules of Court; \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n (iv) that the alleged contemnor has knowledge of the terms of the order; and \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n (v) that the alleged contemnor has breached the terms of the order. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n [32] It is necessary for the plaintiff to prove each element beyond reasonable doubt. In accordance with the principles of the criminal law, in proving element (v) it must be proven that the act or omission which constituted the breach of the order was deliberate and voluntary.\\\"\",\"3\":\"36 As noted by his Honour, the standard of proof required for each of the elements of a charge of contempt of this Court is proof beyond reasonable doubt (see: Witham v Holloway [1995] HCA 3 ; (1995) 183 CLR 525 at 534).\\n\\n37 There is no dispute, and I am satisfied that: \\n \\n\\u2022 Paragraph 1 of the orders I made on 28 September 2007 was an order of the Court. \\n \\n\\u2022 The Order was clear, unambiguous and capable of compliance; \\n \\n\\u2022 The Order was personally served on Mr Morrison on 4 October 2007 and was served on the respondent on 3 October 2007; and \\n \\n\\u2022 Mr Morrison had knowledge of the terms of the Order.\",\"4\":\"40 In Australian Meat Industry Employees' Union v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 46 ; (1986) 161 CLR 98 Gibbs CJ, Mason, Wilson and Deane JJ said (at 112 113) that: \\n \\\"...lying behind punishment for a contempt which involves wilful disobedience to a court order, is the very substantial purpose of disciplining the defendant and vindicating the authority of the court. ... a deliberate commission or omission which is in breach of an injunctive order or an undertaking will constitute such wilful disobedience unless it be casual, accidental or unintentional.\\\"\\n\\n41 It is clear that Mr Morrison's affidavit does not, in terms, comply with the Order. A breach of an order will be considered deliberate if it is not found to be casual, accidental or unintentional. The onus remains on the party seeking to prove the contempt to prove that the alleged contemnor's conduct is not casual, accidental or unintentional.\",\"5\":\"38 It was not disputed that the respondent had knowledge of the terms of the Order.
