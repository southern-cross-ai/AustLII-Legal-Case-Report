In undertaking that task I have been conscious of the fact that a detailed inspection of the transcript of the television and radio advertisements must give a misleading impression of what is conveyed. However, in reviewing each Event I also had at the forefront the following caution from Lindgren J in Gillette Australia Pty Ltd v Energizer Australia Pty Ltd (2002) 193 ALR 629 at [47] regarding television advertising:\\n \\n \\n \\n ... [A]part from the difference between a one-off viewing and repeated viewings, the circumstances in which a judge attends to a television commercial for the purposes of a case are not those in which members of the public do so. First, members of the public watch a commercial after and before viewing other things, rather than in isolation. Second, unlike the judge, they do not carefully view the commercial with a special interest in noting and memorising its features. Third, they view the commercial, not in the calm of chambers, but against a background of distractions, such as domestic activity, or simply a preoccupation with other more interesting or pressing concerns. Fourth, usually they do not know in advance that the commercial is about to commence.\\n\\n41 Similar caution must be adopted when reviewing the other, non-television Events.\\n\\n42 With that caution in mind, I shall now set out a more detailed description of each of the 12 Events.\",\"10\":\"19 As noted, under the two-step analysis that has been described, the court cannot consider each event in isolation.
