"{\"id\":{\"0\":\"c0\"},\"class\":{\"0\":\"referred to\"},\"tocase\":{\"0\":\"Jackson v Sterling Industries Limited [1987] HCA 23 ; (1987) 162 CLR 612\"},\"text\":{\"0\":\"14 Counsel for Mr Hamilton and Newpage in liquidation, Mr Johnson, submitted that Mr Parson's attitude supported the applicants' claim that the money paid into Casino Busters' bank account should be subject to an asset preservation order while the issues surrounding its payment to Casino Busters were sorted out. The power of the Federal Court to grant such relief was recognised by the High Court in Jackson v Sterling Industries Limited [1987] HCA 23 ; (1987) 162 CLR 612 at 623 per Deane J (with whom Mason CJ, Wilson and Dawson JJ agreed). It is important to bear in mind, however, that the purpose of such an order is to protect the processes of the Court from abuse not to provide security for the applicant for such an order; see generally Jackson v Sterling Industries Limited.\\n\\n15 Applications for such relief are often, as in this case, made ex parte. The Court does not have the benefit of hearing argument as to why such an order should not be made from the person against whom the order is sought. For this reason the Court needs to be circumspect in making such orders. In this case, however, I am satisfied that on the evidence before me the applicants have made a prima facie case that the payment by Newpage to Casino Busters is a voidable transaction under s 588FE of the Corporations Act . Given Mr Parson's refusal to assist the provisional liquidator in the exercise of his duties and his denial of any knowledge of the transaction, there is reason to suspect that any order of the Court made to recover the money paid to Casino Busters and apparently still held in its bank account may be frustrated by prior dispersal of the assets. In the circumstances it is appropriate that I make the orders sought by the applicants, in the form of the penal notice that is annexed to these reasons, freezing the relevant bank account of Casino Busters up to but not exceeding the amount of $2,137,000 and requiring Mr Parson to give disclosure of the circumstances under which Casino Busters received the two payments mentioned above at [11]. \\n I certify that the preceding fifteen (15) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Stone. \\n\\n\\n Associate:\\nDated: 6 February 2007\\n On the application for a winding up order: \\n \\n \\n Counsel for the Plaintiffs: J Johnson \\n \\n Solicitor for the Plaintiffs: Kemp Strang \\n \\n Counsel for the Defendant: There was no appearance for the Defendant. \\n \\n On the application for a freezing order: \\n \\n \\n Counsel for the Applicants: J Johnson \\n \\n Solicitor for the Applicants: Kemp Strang \\n \\n Counsel for the Respondents: There was no appearance for the Respondents. \\n \\n Date of Hearing: 25 January 2007 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 6 February 2007 \\n\\n \\n PENAL NOTICE \\n \\n\\n TO: Casino Busters International Pty Ltd\\n ACN 108 453 809\\n\\n AND TO: Roumald Charles Parsons (aka Ron Parsons)\\n\\n \\n IF YOU: \\n\\n \\n (A) REFUSE OR NEGLECT TO DO ANY ACT WITHIN THE TIME SPECIFIED IN THIS ORDER FOR THE DOING OF THE ACT; OR \\n\\n\\n \\n (B) DISOBEY THE ORDER BY DOING AN ACT WHICH THE ORDER REQUIRES YOU TO ABSTAIN FROM DOING, \\n\\n\\n \\n YOU WILL BE LIABLE TO IMPRISONMENT, SEQUESTRATION OF PROPERTY OR OTHER PUNISHMENT. \\n \\n ANY OTHER PERSON WHO KNOWS OF THIS ORDER AND DOES ANYTHING WHICH HELPS OR PERMITS YOU TO BREACH THE TERMS OF THIS ORDER MAY BE SIMILARLY PUNISHED. \\n\\n\\n TO: Casino Busters International Pty Ltd\\n ACN 108 453 809\\n\\n AND TO: Roumald Charles Parsons (aka Ron Parsons)\\n\\n\\nThis is a ' freezing order ' made against Casino Busters International Pty Ltd and a ' disclosure order' made against both of you on 25 January 2007 by Justice Stone at a hearing without notice to you after the Court was given the undertakings set out in Schedule A to this order and after the Court read the affidavits listed in Schedule B to this order.\\n\\n THE COURT ORDERS: \\n INTRODUCTION \\n\\n1. \\n \\n(a) The application for this order is made returnable immediately.\\n \\n\\n \\n(b) The time for service of the application, supporting affidavits and originating process is abridged and service is to be effected by 4.00pm Monday 29 January 2007.\\n \\n \\n\\n2.
