They have presented a statement of agreed facts, and proposed orders. The statement of agreed facts includes reference to allegations in the application which are admitted, and to specified paragraphs of the amended statement of claim which are also admitted. Indeed, Terania and ARE by the proposed agreed orders seek to withdraw their defence.\\n\\n4 I am prepared to make findings on the foundation of that material. The following represents my findings of fact.\\n\\n18 Clearly, by the admission of facts contained in the agreed statement of facts (including by reference to allegations in the statement of claim which are admitted), it is within power for the Court to make the orders which are sought: Thomson Australian Holdings Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1981] HCA 48 ; (1981) 148 CLR 150 at 164. In my view, having regard to the nature and the present status of Terania and ARE, and the fact that the parties have agreed upon the nature of the conduct engaged in, and its contravention of the Act, it is also appropriate for the Court in the public interest and to encourage agreed resolution of enforcement proceedings to make the orders which are sought: see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Real Estate Institute of Western Australia Inc [1999] FCA 18 ; (1999) 161 ALR 79.\",\"1\":\"18 Clearly, by the admission of facts contained in the agreed statement of facts (including by reference to allegations in the statement of claim which are admitted), it is within power for the Court to make the orders which are sought: Thomson Australian Holdings Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1981] HCA 48 ; (1981) 148 CLR 150 at 164.

It is appropriate in a matter such as this to have regard to all the conduct which has been alleged and acknowledged. Clearly, misleading representations as to price are highly likely to mislead consumers and constitute a significant contravention of s 52 of the Act. It is acknowledged that the was price was simply created by the respondents and had no proper foundation. Consumers were likely to have been mislead into believing that the goods in question had previously been offered for sale at the was price, so that the sale price represented a significant reduction from the normal retail price. That may induce consumers to buy those products when they would not otherwise do so. As O'Loughlin J said in Trade Practices Commission v Cue Design Pty Ltd (1996) ATPR 41-475 , where a clothing retailer was using dual-priced tags:\\n [T]he natural and probable consequence of a dual-priced swing tag is that members of the buying public would assume that the garment had previously been offered for sale at the higher of the two prices and was now available at the lower price. ... It was conduct that preyed on the gullibility of the public. \\nIndeed, such conduct may do more than prey on the gullibility of the public. Members of the public do not routinely know the normal retail price of particular goods. And retail price may depend on the quality of the particular goods. The quality of particular goods may also not be readily apparent to some members of the public. It is not merely the gullible who may regard a was price as a real indication of the normal retail price of particular products, at least as offered by and sold by that retailer.\\n\\n21 I am a little more troubled about the duration representations. However, in my view, their combination with the pricing tags was likely to mislead the public. It was likely to mislead the public, or at least some members of the public, into the belief that sale prices at which they may be able to procure the particular goods will end at a specific time and so induce purchasing at or by that specific time rather than making a purchasing decision after reflection. It may induce purchases within or by the specified time because the \\\"sale\\\" also misleadingly presented particular goods as being available at a price significantly reduced from that at which they were normally on offer so that they would not be on offer at that \\\"sale\\\" price after the imminent end of the sale.\\n\\n22 The clearance representations do not present so obvious a contravention of s 52 of the Act, even when taken together with the duration representations and the was price\\/sale price representations.\",\"3\":\"23 In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Telstra Corporation Ltd [2004] FCA 987 ; (2004) 208 ALR 459 , Gyles J said at 467:\\n Reading the numerous cases in this field makes it perfectly apparent that individual judges vary considerably in their assessments of the effect of advertising.

I have considered the proposed injunctions. They are clear, they relate to the conduct which I have found to have been engaged in in contravention of s 52 of the Act; and there is no feature of them which, in my view, makes it inappropriate to make those orders.\\n\\n27 Similarly, I have considered the proposed compliance program. I had previously raised some issues about its terms, but they have been addressed.\\n\\n28 I am therefore prepared to make the proposed consent orders. The proposed orders are in the nature of injunctive relief, restraining the respondents from engaging in conduct of the nature which they have admitted they have engaged in in the past and which has contravened s 52 of the Act, and for costs. I have been informed by the parties that since the hearing of submissions, both Terania and ARE have ceased trading and the assets of Terania have been sold, including the sale of the business name \\\"Gouger Rugs\\\" and \\\"Barry Solomon's Gouger Rugs\\\", its stock and various fittings and fixtures. Bookings of venues for scheduled sale events to be conducted by Terania and ARE have been cancelled. Consequently, although it is not now appropriate for Terania and ARE to undertake a trade practices compliance program, the proposed orders contemplate that in the event that they resume similar trading activities in the future, they should undertake a trade practices compliance program. I think that is appropriate. It is also intended that Mr Solomon will give an undertaking that he will in any event undertake a Trade Practices Compliance Program seminar relating to the provisions of Pt 5 of the Act. He is prepared to do so and the ACCC is prepared to accept that undertaking. I will note his undertaking.\"}}"
