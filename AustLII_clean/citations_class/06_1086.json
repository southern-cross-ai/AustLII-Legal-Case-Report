Driver FM cited NAWZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 199 in support of this proposition.\\n\\nLimitations of time in respect of filing and serving notices of appeal of decisions of the Federal Magistrates Court in the Federal Court are set out in O 52 r 15 Federal Court Rules . The rule provides: \\n \\n '(1) The notice of appeal shall be filed and served - \\n \\n \\n (a) within 21 days after - \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n (i) the date when the judgment appealed from was pronounced; \\n (ii) the date when leave to appeal was granted; or \\n (iii) any later date fixed for that purpose by the court appealed from; or \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n (b) within such further time as is allowed by the Court or a Judge upon application made by motion upon notice filed within the period of 21 days referred to in the last preceding paragraph. \\n \\n \\n (2) Notwithstanding anything in the preceding subrule, the Court or a Judge for special reasons may at any time give leave to file and serve a notice of appeal.'\\n\\nThe applicant in this case did not apply to the Court within 21 days of the judgment of Driver FM. The decision of Driver FM was handed down on 13 March 2006 and the application for an extension of time was filed in this Court on 5 April 2005, two days outside the timeframe. It follows that the applicant is required to seek the leave of this Court pursuant to O 52 r 15(2) to file and serve a notice of appeal.\\n\\nThe first respondent, in written and oral submissions asserted that: \\u2022 the court below did not err in concluding that the protection visa application was valid notwithstanding that the applicant has signed it in a false name and made false claims: citing NAWZ \\u2022 the court below never had jurisdiction so its order to dismiss the application with costs was an appropriate order \\u2022 alternatively if the court below did have jurisdiction, there was no error in concluding that the protection visa application was valid and as such the application should have been dismissed with costs \\u2022 even if the court below had jurisdiction and the protection visa application was invalid, relief should have been refused anyway given that the applicant had knowingly participated in a deception of the minister.\\n\\nThe submissions of the applicant and the submissions of the first respondent are somewhat divergent. The applicant has directed his submissions, including assertions in his affidavit of 5 April 2006 and his oral submissions, towards the delay in filing his notice of appeal, and addressing the decision of the Tribunal. The first respondent has focussed on the issue of the validity of the protection visa application and the validity of the decision of the Tribunal as determined by Driver FM.\\n\\nThe case before Driver FM was determined by his Honour on the issue of the validity of the visa application and the Tribunal hearing. I have briefly recounted the reasons for this in this judgment. Driver FM explains the background in more detail in his judgment. In this case the applicant sought a show cause order in the Federal Magistrates Court pursuant to r 44.12 Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 which is as follows: \\n \\n ' Show cause hearing \\n \\n \\n (1) At a hearing of an application for an order to show cause, the Court may: \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n (a) if it is not satisfied that the application has raised an arguable case for the relief claimed -- dismiss the application; or \\n (b) if it is satisfied that the application has raised an arguable case for the relief claimed -- adjourn the proceeding and order a respondent to show cause at a final hearing why an order for the relief claimed should not be made on such of the grounds mentioned in the application as are specified by the Court; or \\n (c) without making an order under paragraph (b), make final orders in relation to the claims for relief and grounds mentioned in the application. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n (2) To avoid doubt, a dismissal under paragraph (1)(a) is interlocutory.'\\n\\nHearing the application on 27 February 2006, it appears his Honour dismissed the application insofar as it attacked the merits of the Tribunal decision. As clear from r 44.12(2), that decision was interlocutory. His Honour went on however to grant the application in relation to the validity of the protection visa application and the Tribunal decision, which the learned Federal Magistrate heard on 13 March 2006.\\n\\nThe applicant could have sought leave to appeal the decision of Driver FM of 27 February 2006 in relation to the dismissal of the show cause application relevant to the merits of the Tribunal decision. He did not do so, and is not doing so now. Instead he lodged an amended application in the Federal Magistrates Court as already discussed. Unfortunately, from the grounds which have been put before me in this matter, it is possible that the applicant did not understand that his Honour was dismissing that part of his application.\\n\\nTo that extent, submissions of the applicant in relation to the merits of the Tribunal decision, and why he was unsuccessful before the Tribunal, are not relevant in this case. I note, for the benefit of the applicant, that this Court has a limited jurisdiction in reviewing decisions of the Tribunal, and in fact has no jurisdiction to review findings of fact by the Tribunal, nor investigate the merits of the applicant's claim, except to the extent that errors of law may be demonstrated. I also note however although this does not form part of my decision that the Tribunal appeared to give careful consideration to the claims of the applicant, including giving him the benefit of the doubt in respect of a number of his claims, but nonetheless affirmed the decision not to grant a protection visa for reasons stated in their Decision Record.\\n\\nIn relation to the submissions of the respondent, the decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court in NAWZ is applicable. Although made in the context of s 98 of the Act, I note in particular comments of their Honours at par 18: \\n \\n 'We do not consider that the irregular manner of filling in and signing of the false application resulted in the invalidity of the application. It was a false application but it was, in formal terms, a valid application.'\\n\\nIn this case, the applicant had completed an application for a protection visa under a false name, and signed it. As Driver FM pointed out, that fact alone does not render the application invalid, it was the applicant's application regardless of what name he chose to use on it, and it was a complete application regardless of whether the claims and other details in it were true or false. Further, in my view it would be contrary to public policy to allow the applicant to claim that the process of lodgement of a protection visa was flawed because he had lodged the first application under a false name, for whatever reason (cf NAWZ at par 14).\\n\\nAccordingly on this reasoning both the decision of the delegate of the Minister and the Tribunal were valid.\",\"2\":\"The principles applicable to an extension of time are well settled. Whilst it is important that parties observe the time limits set by the Rules, the Court does have discretion to extend time to permit a notice of appeal to be filed in order to avoid injustice where a party has missed a prescribed deadline for filing ( Parker v The Queen [2002] FCAFC 133 at pars 10-13). The applicant must however demonstrate 'special reasons' to the Court.\\n\\nGuiding principles which may assist the Court in exercising its discretion under O 52 r 15(2) were articulated by Wilcox J in Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen (1984) 3 FCR 344 at 348-349, and subsequently adopted by the Full Court in Parker v The Queen at pars 6-7, as follows: 1. 'Applications for an extension of time are not to be granted unless it is proper to do so; the legislated time limits are not to be ignored. The applicant must show an \\\"acceptable explanation for the delay\\\"; it must be \\\"fair and equitable in the circumstances\\\" to extend time. 2. Action taken by the applicant, other than by way of making an application for review, is relevant to the consideration of the question whether an acceptable explanation for the delay has been furnished. 3. Any prejudice to the respondent in defending the proceedings that is caused by the delay is a material factor militating against the grant of an extension. 4. However, the mere absence of prejudice is not enough to justify the grant of an extension. 5. The merits of the substantial application are to be taken into account in considering whether an extension of time should be granted.'\",\"3\":\"In my view in this case the applicant has insufficient prospects of success to warrant granting an extension of time to file a notice of appeal ( WAAD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 399 at par 9 per Lee, Nicholson and Finkelstein JJ, and more recently Conti J in SZFBU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1018 at pars 9-10). Notwithstanding that the delay in filing the notice of appeal was short and it appeared that the respondents experienced no prejudice, in my view the appropriate order is to dismiss the application with costs. \\n ORDER \\n \\n 1. The application for extension of time to file and serve a notice of appeal be dismissed.\\n 2.

The applicant also noted that his migration agent had not lodged his amended application in the Federal Magistrates Court, although I note from the judgment of Driver FM that his Honour gave leave for a form of amended application to be filed in court ( SZHTW v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2006] FMCA 356 at par 6).\",\"5\":\"In my view in this case the applicant has insufficient prospects of success to warrant granting an extension of time to file a notice of appeal ( WAAD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 399 at par 9 per Lee, Nicholson and Finkelstein JJ, and more recently Conti J in SZFBU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1018 at pars 9-10).
