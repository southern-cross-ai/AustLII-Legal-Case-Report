However, Mr Arthur contends that orders 2 and 3 were made in breach of the principles which govern the grant of injunctive relief under s 80 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) as recently considered and explained by a Full Court in Foster v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2006] FCAFC 21 ; (2006) 149 FCR 135.\\n\\nIn particular, Mr Arthur submits that it was not appropriate to make orders 2 and 3 because there was no sufficient nexus demonstrated between the contravention of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act and the conduct which is the subject of orders 2 and 3. Mr Arthur concedes that the grant of interlocutory injunctive relief was an exercise of his Honour's discretion and that it is necessary for him to point to an error of principle in the making of orders of 2 and 3. He submits that whilst it would have been open to his Honour to find a nexus, his Honour failed to do so. Alternatively he submits that there was no evidence from which his Honour could draw that conclusion.\\n\\nIt seems to me that the learned Federal Magistrate must be taken in [24] and [25] of his reasons to have found that there was a threat to continue to make the implied representation which his Honour found to have been made in [11] and which gave rise to the exercise of the learned Federal Magistrate's discretion to grant injunctive relief. I'm satisfied that there was evidence, in particular in the affidavit of Ms Klitogiannis, to support that finding.\\n\\nWhilst it would certainly have been open to the learned Federal Magistrate to decline to make orders 2 and 3; see for example Australian Rugby Union Ltd v Hospitality Group Pty Ltd (2000) 173 ALR 702 at [152] to [153], I can see no error of principle by the learned Federal Magistrate in deciding upon the evidence before him that orders 2 and 3 were appropriate within the principles referred to by the Full Court in Foster . Accordingly, the order I will make is that leave to appeal be refused. \\n\\n\\n I certify that the preceding six (6) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Jacobson J. \\n\\n\\n Associate:\\n\\nDated: 18 October 2006\\n\\n\\n Counsel for the Applicant: R J Arthur \\n \\n Solicitor for the Applicant: Bradley Allen Lawyers \\n \\n Counsel for the Respondent: B J Salmon QC with C Besemeres \\n \\n Solicitor for the Respondent: J S O'Connor Harris & Co \\n \\n Date of Hearing: 18 October 2006 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 18 October 2006 \\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2006\\/1392.html\",\"1\":\"Whilst it would certainly have been open to the learned Federal Magistrate to decline to make orders 2 and 3; see for example Australian Rugby Union Ltd v Hospitality Group Pty Ltd (2000) 173 ALR 702 at [152] to [153], I can see no error of principle by the learned Federal Magistrate in deciding upon the evidence before him that orders 2 and 3 were appropriate within the principles referred to by the Full Court in Foster .
