Section 25(2B)(bb)(ii) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) empowers the Court to make an order that an appeal to the Court be dismissed for failure of the appellant to attend a hearing relating to the appeal. In circumstances where no proper justification has been given for the failure to attend, in my view, it is appropriate to exercise the discretion given to make such an order. In reaching this conclusion, I have considered the principles in other cases dealing with similar matters, in particular the decisions of NAKX v Minister of Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 1559 , and NALM v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 17 , which support the exercise of the power in these circumstances.\",\"1\":\"9 The question arises then how to dispose of the matter.
