The Tribunal directed that $60,000 of Mr Barrington's compensation payment be treated as not having been made: Barrington and Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations [2005] AATA 1050.\\n\\n5 On appeal to this Court the Secretary accepts that the decision of the Tribunal was open on the evidence. However, he submits that in its process the Tribunal made two errors of law: \\n\\n\\u2022 It failed to deal with a submission seriously advanced by the Secretary which was worthy of consideration, namely the fact that Mr Barrington's purchase of a house after he had received notice of the lump sum preclusion period told against the recognition of special circumstances; and\\n \\n\\u2022 It denied the Secretary natural justice by basing its finding of \\\"special circumstances\\\" on the payment of $47,500 legal costs out of the settlement payment of $285,000:\\n \\n1. without giving the Secretary any notice that it might treat the costs payment as relevant;\\n \\n2. having discouraged the Secretary from making submissions on that issue; and \\n \\n3. thereby denying the Secretary the opportunity to make submissions on that issue.\\n\\n6 Mr Barrington was injured at work in 1999 and received weekly compensation until 12 September 2002. On that day he settled an action for damages for $285,000 inclusive of legal costs. He received the net amount of $237,500 after deduction of legal costs. Mr Barrington said in evidence that he actually paid $55,000 in legal fees. The Tribunal thought it possible that he was required to pay a further $7,500 out of the net amount, but was satisfied he paid at least $47,500.\",\"1\":\"27 On the present appeal Senior Counsel for the Secretary relied on a line of authority commencing with Dennis Wilcox Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 79 ALR 267. At the time of that decision s 43(2) was in substantially the same terms as the present subs (2B). Jenkinson J, with whom Woodward and Foster JJ agreed, said at 276-277\\n \\\"There is also the further possibility that the tribunal's failure to mention either the submission or the questions of fact which it raises was the result of a failure, by inadvertence, to consider the submission when the tribunal was engaged in deciding the reference. Not every failure by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to mention a contention advanced on behalf of a party will amount to a failure to comply with the requirements of s 43(2) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 , or demonstrate that the contention was not considered in deciding the matter before the tribunal. But this submission concerning the ascertainment of profit was worthy of serious consideration and was seriously advanced to the tribunal. It ought, therefore, to be inferred that the submission was inadvertently overlooked by the tribunal either when the reference was being decided or when the reasons for the decision were being committed to writing (cf Sullivan v Department of Transport (1978) 20 ALR 323 at 353). In either event there has been, in my opinion, an error of law by the tribunal, so that the power of this court which s 44(1) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 confers to decide the appeal \\\"on a question of law\\\" is available. The failure of the tribunal to carry out the duty to consider and determine each question of law and fact relevant to the determination of the reference to it of the respondent's decision, or the failure to carry out the duty imposed by s 43(2) of that Act, as the case may be, has brought about a miscarriage of justice by preventing this Court from affording the parties a determination whether the tribunal's decision was vitiated by error of law: see Pettit v Dunkley [1971] 1 NSWLR 376.\\n\\n33 However, on the assumption that Dennis Wilcox is still good law, the principle for which that case stands is not applicable here. Mr Barrington's being aware of the preclusion period before he purchased the Burnie house was not in dispute. It was not a discrete legal or factual issue standing apart from the rest of the case as discussed in the Tribunal's reasons. It was a part of the larger narrative which also included Mr Barrington's plans and expectations when he bought the house, and how illness and lack of employment opportunities thwarted them. The omission by the Tribunal of any reference to a particular element of that narrative does not of itself lead to the conclusion that such element was ignored or overlooked: cf Kentucky Fried Chicken Pty Ltd v Gantidis [1979] HCA 20 ; (1979) 140 CLR 675 at 680, 684. If a fact is not in itself disputed, that may be a reason why it is not mentioned. The bare fact of spending compensation money on an asset after becoming aware of a preclusion period would often tell against a finding of special circumstances, as the Guide points out. But in the present case what really opened up the possibility of a special circumstances finding is what happened after the purchase, including Mr Barrington's health and employment problems.\",\"2\":\"28 This approach has been adopted in later cases: Kalwy v Secretary, Department of Social Security (No 2) (1993) 32 ALD 451 at 460-461 and Repatriation Commission v Smith (1997) 75 FCR 298 at 306.

The RRT affirmed the refusal of a protection visa without expressing any finding about the alleged attack on the husband. The High Court reversed the Federal Court's decision that the RRT had failed to comply with s 430(1).\\n\\n31 The High Court held that s 430(1)(c) only required the RRT to set out the findings which it did make and which it considered material to the decision to be made; the section did not oblige the setting out of findings which the Tribunal had not in fact made: per Gleeson CJ at [10], per McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ at [68]. A failure to make a finding may reveal another error, such as failure to take account of relevant considerations: [73]-[75], but that is a distinct and different ground.\\n\\n32 In the present case the argument said to be left unconsidered would not be a relevant consideration in the sense expounded in Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 39, that is to say a consideration the Tribunal was bound by the Social Security Act to take into account. On the appeal to this Court senior counsel for the Secretary did not so contend. At best, Mr Barrington's purchase of the house after awareness of the preclusion period was a part of the factual matrix of this particular case, the setting in which s 1184K(1) had to be applied. The reasoning in Yusuf rather suggests the Tribunal made no legal error simply by failing to refer to one argument advanced, so long as it otherwise complied with s 43(2B) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act .\",\"5\":\"32 In the present case the argument said to be left unconsidered would not be a relevant consideration in the sense expounded in Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 39, that is to say a consideration the Tribunal was bound by the Social Security Act to take into account.

Having raised the issue of Mr Barrington's costs, and given counsel the opportunity to submit anything he wished on the two questions mentioned, the Tribunal declined the offer of more detailed submissions. This case is a far cry from Stead v State Government Insurance Commission [1986] HCA 54 ; (1986) 161 CLR 141 which senior counsel for the Secretary relied on in the present appeal. There the trial judge told counsel that he did not accept the evidence of an expert witness on a particular issue, leading counsel to make no further submissions, and then decided the case by relying on the same witness.\\n\\n39 The appeal will be dismissed with costs. \\n\\n\\n I certify that the preceding thirty nine (39) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Heerey . \\n\\nAssociate:\\n\\nDated: \\n\\n\\n\\n Counsel for the Applicant: P Hanks QC \\n \\n Solicitor for the Applicant: Australian Government Solicitor \\n \\n Counsel for the Respondent: N Batten \\n \\n Solicitor for the Respondent: Launceston Community Legal Centre \\n \\n Date of Hearing: 27 April 2006 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 10 May 2006 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2006\\/527.html\"}}"
