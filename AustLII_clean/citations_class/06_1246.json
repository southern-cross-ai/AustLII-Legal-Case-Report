I am of opinion that in crafting orders, conditioning the grant of leave so as to obviate the necessity for Pan to litigate both in the United States and England to set those restraining orders aside and to provide that they can, in effect, be automatically reinstated, will mean that the institution of the appeal will not be able to be seen as being unduly vexatious or oppressive, within the meaning of the authorities to which I have referred.\\n\\nRight-thinking people would regard it as very odd that the appellate processes of the court could be invoked by one party who says a decision is wrong, which held it had no right to arbitrate, who on the other hand, asserts that it can keep in place ex parte orders obtained in aid of that arbitration from courts overseas. It does not seem right that Comandate Marine can pursue an appeal in this jurisdiction leaving Pan to pursue litigation overseas to secure the benefit of its result here, in circumstances where one is dealing with commercial litigation. In the present case appropriate protective orders can be made and there is no evidence before, me despite an invitation to identify any, to show that there is any prejudice to Comandate Marine in this result.\\n\\nDoing the best I can to balance the rights of both of the parties, I am of opinion that it is appropriate to impose a condition on the grant of leave that Comandate Marine give up its current orders in aid of the arbitration. It seems to me that those orders currently, other than requiring Pan not to dissipate its assets otherwise than in the ordinary course of business which it is obliged to do under Australian law in any event, on the evidence before me, do not actually secure any real right of Comandate Marine or give it a benefit. So, I do not consider that it will suffer some substantial prejudice by being required to adhere to the position that there is no arbitration currently on foot by reason of the determination that I made on 22 August 2006.\\n\\nThis is an application to commence an appeal in commercial litigation which ought be approached commercially in the exercise of discretions attending a grant of leave. I am of opinion that where the court is in a position to give an urgent hearing of the appeal, as will occur, and where there is no practical prejudice, on the evidence, suffered by the vacation of the two orders that have been obtained only for the purposes of the arbitration, I ought to require Comandate Marine to take steps to discharge them. Comandate Marine argued that that was interfering with the jurisdiction of the United States District Court and the High Court of Justice of England and Wales.\",\"1\":\"I am of opinion that there is the power in the Court to impose conditions on a grant of leave to appeal in circumstances where, like the present, the appeal is interlocutory but there are other proceedings on foot, the benefit of which the unsuccessful party seeks to maintain while at the same time seeking to challenge the result which would have the effect of negating the factual substratum underlying those other proceedings. Such a power seems to me to fall within the inherent power of a superior court of record to condition orders that it makes inter partes to accord with the requirements of the demands of justice, just as the power to grant a stay is not confined to closed categories of cases of which vexatious suits is one illustration. It is a power which is exercisable in any situation where the requirements of justice demand it: Tringali v Stewardson Stubbs & Collett Pty Limited (1966) 66 SR NSW 335 at 344. The power to impose conditions should be similarly approached.\",\"2\":\"In Walton v Gardiner [1992] HCA 12 ; (1993) 177 CLR 378 at 393 Mason CJ and Deane and Dawson JJ discussed the inherent jurisdiction of a superior court to stay proceedings on the grounds of abuse of process and said that that power extended to all those categories of cases in which the processes and procedures of the court which exist to administer justice with fairness and impartiality may be converted into instruments of injustice or unfairness. They relied on what Lord Diplock had said in Hunter v Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police [1982] AC 529 at 536, that the inherent power which any court of justice must possess is to prevent misuse of its procedure in a way which, although not inconsistent with the literal application of its procedural rules, would nevertheless be manifestly unfair to a party to litigation before it or would otherwise bring the administration of justice into disrepute among right-thinking people.\"}}"
