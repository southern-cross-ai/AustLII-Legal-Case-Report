The Appellant now appeals to this Court. The handwritten Notice of Appeal sets forth the Grounds of Appeal as follows (without alteration):\\n 1. the Tribunal did not carefully consider the information which was in favour of the applicant. 2. the Tribunal no evidence or other materials to justify the making of the decision. 3. the Tribunal failed to grant to me a visa without any proper grounds or any proper investigation.\\n\\n4 The Appellant appeared before the Court this morning unrepresented, but with the assistance of an interpreter.\",\"8\":\"21 In such circumstances it cannot be concluded that there was any failure on the part of the Tribunal to make a \\\" proper investigation \\\". Nor was such a contention advanced before the Federal Magistrates Court. It should further be noted that even had the Appellant requested that a witness be called before the Tribunal, the Tribunal was under no duty to allow such evidence to be given: Migration Act 1958 (Cth), s 426(3). As was the like conclusion in VJAF v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 178 , there is not considered in the present proceedings to be any reason to find that an obligation was imposed upon the Tribunal to call or to hear further evidence from the fellow Falun Gong practitioner referred to by the now Appellant.\\n\\n22 The final ground is thus also rejected.\\n\\n23 An Affidavit was filed in Court on the day of hearing seeking a fixed costs order in the event that the appeal was dismissed. That Affidavit sought a fixed costs order in the sum of $2,200. There is no reason to question that quantification.\"}}"
