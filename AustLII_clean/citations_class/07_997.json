Having regard to [Caltex's] conduct to [Socasen] and [Socasen's] financial position as to a result thereof and Caltex's ability to withdraw monies from [Socasen's] bank account, I was reluctant to bring the rollover up to date as that would have provided a trigger for Caltex to take away any surplus from [Socasen's] cash flow.'\\n\\n27 It is conceded by Caltex that there is a serious question to be tried as to Socasen's entitlement to an award of damages by reason of the pleaded problems with the On Q system and, possibly, by reason of underpayment of REM entitlements.\\n\\n28 No such concession is made concerning any claim by Socasen for relief in respect of the termination notice. I use the expression 'any claim' because Socasen has not amended the claims for relief in its application following the service of the termination notice. I consider it appropriate to proceed on the basis that at trial Socasen will probably seek an injunction under s 80 of the TPA restraining Caltex from placing reliance on the notice of termination or, alternatively, an order under s 87(1) of the TPA effectively reinstating the Agreement (s 87(2)(b) and (ba)).\"}}"
