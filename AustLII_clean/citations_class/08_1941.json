As noted earlier s 65C1(a) prohibits the supply of goods which do not comply with a prescribed safety standard. In contrast to ss 52 and 53, s 65C does not ask whether a consumer is likely to be misled, nor does it ask what a consumer might understand about a certain product. To put it even more bluntly, s 65C is not concerned with representations at all. It simply poses an objective question: has a product been supplied for consumer use which does not comply with a prescribed safety standard? To prove a case under this provision, a party must: (1) identify a product; (2) identify the time of supply of that product; (3) identify the relevant safety standard in force at the time; and (4) lead evidence showing that the particular product did not meet the standard: see ACCC v Hercules Iron Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1182 at [10] .\\n\\nLED Tech, in approaching its case on a misleading and deceptive conduct basis only, failed to establish the elements of its s 65C case in a satisfactory manner. While it led evidence of safety tests and the supply of lamps, it failed to connect particular lamps, having been supplied at particular times, to particular tests demonstrating non-compliance of those lamps with the ADRs. The last bit would in any event have been tricky, if not impossible, because the ADRs, due to the peculiar amendments that have been made to the UNECE Regulation and the uncertain status of the Circulars, do not really prescribe much of a standard. Not only is a 20% variance in luminosity allowed, there is no procedure (notwithstanding any industry practice or understanding to the contrary) as to how compliance with the standard is to be assessed and proved. Based on the evidence, it appears that the tests relied on by LED Tech to establish the non-compliance of the Condor Products may have applied stricter procedural and substantive criteria than those actually imposed by the applicable rules and regulations. Therefore, I cannot be satisfied on the balance of the probabilities that the Corporate Respondents did in fact supply products that did not comply with the ADRs. No damage\",\"1\":\"However, if LED Tech had established damage, I do not consider that each of Messrs Keller and Armstrong knew of the \\\"essential matters\\\" that enabled the representations to be characterised in the manner contended: ACCC v Kaye [2004] FCA 1363 at [182] - [186] . To adopt the language of the majority of the Full Court in Medical Benefits Fund of Australia Ltd v Cassidy [2003] FCAFC 289 ; (2003) 135 FCR 1 at [12-16] , although I accept that each of Messrs Keller and Armstrong knew (1) that the Condor Products were manufactured, sold and packaged and (2) the content of the manner in which they were sold which might lead members of at least one class of consumer to believe that the products complied with \\\"prescribed consumer product safety standards\\\", I do not conclude that either Messrs Keller or Armstrong knew the facts that meant that the Representations were not correct. As to the \\\"ADR Approved\\\" representation, they gave evidence as to their subjective understanding of the representation conveyed, which, while possibly negligent or even reckless, was not such as to suggest wilful blindness or actual knowledge of how a relevant purchaser might understand it. As to the \\\"Complies with ADR\\\" representation, their evidence (which I accept) was that they relied upon oral and written assurances from their Chinese manufacturer and testing laboratories which turned out to be belatedly or never substantiated. Was that conduct less than wise? - Yes. Was it negligent and possibly even reckless? - Again, yes. But on the current state of the authorities that is not sufficient to establish the actual knowledge necessary to establish accessorial liability under the TPA. Significantly, it was never put to either Mr Keller or Mr Armstrong during the course of cross-examination that they knew these \\\"essential matters\\\". Accordingly, even if LED Tech had established that the TPA contraventions had caused it damage, they could not establish the secondary liability of the Directors for those contraventions.\",\"2\":\"However, the question remains, what then is the Australian standard? One thing that does not inform the answer to this question is industry practice. A deal of evidence was led as to what automotive industry experts thought the ADRs required and how the industry tested for compliance in practice. The general thrust of this evidence was that the industry treated much of the removed sections as still being applicable. However, as the Court stated in MHG Plastic Industries v ACCC (2000) ATPR (Digest) 46-206 at [49], any industry practice adopted as to the testing of products against a safety standard cannot affect the proper construction of the requirements under the safety standard. As Emmett J said at first instance in that decision ( ACCC v MHG Plastic Industries Pty Ltd [1999] ATPR 41-712 at [22]), \\\" The Standard means what it says\\\" .\",\"3\":\"In the circumstances, the better approach is to assess damages doing the best I can, even if such quantification necessarily involves a degree of speculation and guesswork: eg Placer (Granny Smith) Pty Ltd v Thiess Contractors Pty Ltd [2003] HCA 10 ; (2003) 196 ALR 257 at [37] - [38] ; Adidas-Solomon AG v Turner (2003) 58 IPR 66 at [4]-[5]; Enzed Holdings Ltd v Wynthea Pty Ltd (1984) 57 ALR 167 , 183; Sony Computer Entertainment Australia Pty Ltd v Stirling [2001] FCA 1852 at [7] .\",\"4\":\"In Allen Manufacturing Co Pty Ltd v McCallum & Co Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1838 ; (2001) 53 IPR 400 at [39] , a design infringement case, the Full Court of the Federal Court considered the two tests in the following terms: \\nThe authorities were collected and analysed by Beazley J in King v Milpurrurru (1996) 66 FCR 474 at 494-500..... Her Honour noted the existence of two lines of authority. One line supported what she called the \\\"Performing Right Society test \\\" : whether the director had \\\"directed or procured\\\" the company's infringement. The other line supported \\\"the Mentmore test\\\": whether the director had engaged in \\\"the deliberate, wilful and knowing pursuit of a course of conduct that was likely to constitute infringement or reflected an indifference to the risk of it\\\". Beazley J expressed a preference for the Mentmore test, on the basis that the Performing Right Society test did not \\\"pay sufficient regard, either to the separate legal existence of the company, or to the fact that the company acts through its directors\\\": see [66 FCR at 500]. However, this preference had no immediate consequence; her Honour held (again at [500]) that the appellants were not liable under either test.\",\"5\":\"The \\\"informed user\\\" concept has also been considered by the courts in the United Kingdom. In Woodhouse UK plc v Architectural Lighting Systems [2006] RPC 1 at [59], Judge Fysh QC of the Patents County Court defined an informed use r in the following terms: \\nFirst, this notional person must obviously be a user of articles of the sort which is subject of the registered design - and I would think, a regular user at that. He could thus be a consumer or buyer or be otherwise familiar with the subject matter say, through use at work. The quality smacks of practical considerations.

The approach may be summarised in six points, as follows:\",\"12\":\"Authorship of a design is in the \\\"person whose mind conceives the relevant shape, configuration, pattern or ornamentation applicable to the article in question and reduces it to visible form\\\": Chris Ford Enterprises Pty Ltd v BH & JR Badenhop Pty Ltd (1985) 7 FCR 75 , 80. On the facts just described, it is clear that Mr Ottobre is the person who conceived the relevant shape, configuration and pattern of the Designs and reduced it to a visible form; \\\"M\\\" simply converted that design to an electronic form in order to facilitate the production process. Put another way, it was Mr Ottobre, not \\\"M\\\", who had the idea for dual and triple combination LED lamps in one base. It was Mr Ottobre who reduced that idea to visible form in the sketches. As the engineering drawings marked \\\"1\\\", \\\"2\\\" and \\\"3\\\" on Annexure C record, it was Mr Ottobre's sketches which contained the features different from those in any other previous design. Accordingly, Mr Ottobre was \\\"the person who created the design\\\" and his company as his employer was the sole person entitled to be registered as its owner: s 13(1)(b) of the 2003 Designs Act .\\n\\nAssuming, contrary to what I have just found, that the facts set out above would support the conclusion that it was an employee or employees of \\\"M\\\", instead of (or in addition to) Mr Ottobre, who was the author of the Designs, then my conclusion on the entitlement question would not change. I accept (and it was not contested) that \\\"M\\\" was an independent contractor rather than an employee of LED Tech. That being so, \\\"M\\\" and its employees did the work \\\"under a contract with another person\\\" (LED Tech) within the meaning of s 13(1)(b) of the 2003 Designs Act and LED Tech is the person entitled to register the design thus created.\\n\\nThere was some dispute as to whether there was in fact any contract between LED Tech and \\\"M\\\" for the creation of the CAD drawings. The proposition was founded on the basis that there was no separate charge or entry on any billing invoice relating specifically to the provision of that particular service. It may greatly be doubted that the absence of an itemised amount charged for the service goes any distance towards showing that the work was not done under a contract. Be this as it may, in the end, I accept the evidence of Mr Chao that the price on the invoice for the moulds included in it the cost of the creation of the CAD drawings, which were necessary and incidental to the manufacture of the moulds themselves. In other words, I am satisfied that the Designs, to the extent that they were created by \\\"M\\\" at all, were so created pursuant to a contract with LED Tech.\",\"13\":\"There is an Administrator of Vehicle Standards: s 22 of the MVSA. It is common ground that proof of vehicle standards is not required: s 143(1)(b) of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth). The Minister has determined the following relevant standards as vehicle standards pursuant to s 7 of the MVSA: Vehicle Standard (Australian Design Rule 1\\/00 Reversing Lamps) 2005 White dated 21 November 2005 (\\\"ADR 1\\\"), prescribes the photometric requirements for reversing lamps which will warn pedestrians and other road users that the vehicle is about to move or is moving in the reverse direction, and which during the hours of darkness will aid the driver in reversing manoeuvres; Vehicle Standard (Australian Design Rule 6\\/00 Direction Indicators) 2005 Yellow \\/ Amber dated 13 December 2006 (\\\"ADR 6\\\"), prescribes the photometric requirements for a device mounted on a motor vehicle or trailer which when operated by the driver signals the latter's intention to change the direction in which the vehicle is proceeding; Vehicle Standard (Australian Design Rule 49\\/00 Front and Rear Position (Side) Lamps, Stop Lamps and End Outline Marker Lamps) 2005 Red dated 3 April 2007 (\\\"ADR 49\\\"), prescribes the photometric requirements for light-signalling devices which will indicate the presence, width and position of the vehicle when viewed from the front and from the rear. \\nThe determination accompanying ADR 1 suggests that the ADR was determined to be a vehicle standard under s 7(1) of the MVSA. No such provision exists. For the purposes of this analysis I have assumed that the determination was in fact made under s 7 of the MVSA. None of the parties suggested that this apparent error invalidated or otherwise altered the operation of the standard, and in any event the authorities hold that, as a general matter, judicial redrafting of obvious typographical errors is permitted: Saraswati v The Queen [1991] HCA 21 ; (1991) 172 CLR 1 , 21-22; Cooper Brookes (Wollongong) Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) [1981] HCA 26 ; (1981) 147 CLR 297 , 305, 311, 321.\",\"14\":\"As a result of difficulties in interpretation and application, the Australian Law Reform Commission (\\\"ALRC\\\") recommended that the \\\"innovation threshold\\\" in s 17(1) of the 1906 Designs Act be replaced by the two-step \\\"new and distinctive\\\" test now found in the 2003 Designs Act: Report No 74, Designs (1995) (the \\\"ALRC Report\\\"). The ALRC addressed the issue in the following terms: \\n5.8 Meaning of distinctive. Distinctiveness is a term used by the courts to express the quality that a design must have to differentiate it sufficiently from previously published or used designs. For example the courts have said\\n \\n \\nfor a design to be protected there must be a special or distinctive appearance, something in the design which captures and appeals to the eye. To have that effect, the design must be noticeable and have some perceptible appearance of an individual character: [ Dart Industries Inc v Decor Corporation Pty Ltd (1989) AIPC 90-569 , 38, 975. In another case, relating to furniture design, it was said that design in such a field is a subtle thing and, provided it is distinctive to the trained eye, I think that registration should not be denied in view of the element of subtlety which is involved in the combination of old features in a particular way and the manner in which they are combined: D Sebel & Co Ltd v National Art Metal Co Pty Ltd (1965) 10 FLR 224, 227; approved in Australian Building Industries Pty Ltd v Woodman McDonald (Glass) Pty Ltd [1986] AIPC 90-302.] \\n \\n \\nOther cases have spoken of 'the overall distinctive appearance of the registered design' [ Firmagroup Australia Pty Ltd v Byrne & Davidson Doors (Vic) Pty Ltd (1987) AIPC para 37, 634, 638] the ridging or grooving of a design being 'sufficiently bold and distinctive in its appeal to the eye', [ Aluminum Specialities Pty Ltd v Ibis Building Products Pty Ltd ( 1982) 42 ALR 127 , 133] a shape or configuration that is 'distinctly different' from that in respect of which a design is registered [ Turbo Tek Enterprises Inc v Sperling Enterprises Pty Ltd [1989] AIPC para 90-616, 39, 334, 348] and a design that must be 'distinct and must present an appearance that strikes the eye as being different' [ Fisher LJ & Co Ltd v Fabtile Industries Pty Ltd (1979) 49 AOJP 3611] ...\\n \\n \\n5.9 Grounds for adopting the new test. The [ALRC] favours the two tiered approach and the distinctiveness test for several reasons.\\n \\n The distinctiveness test is a design approach. It recognises the importance of design in product differentiation. It is consistent with the way in which designers work.\\n It will discourage the tendency to focus narrowly on 'one individual specific appearance' and to count up the differences between designs.\\n It incorporates in a single concept many of the qualities sought in other unsatisfactory expressions such as 'judged by the eye', 'eye appeal', 'immaterial detail', 'trade variants', and 'obvious adaptation'.\\n It is a more focussed test for assessing the degree to which a design is an advance on the prior art.\\n It allows a different prior art base to be defined for novelty as against distinctiveness. This is useful because the aim with the novelty test is to exclude identical designs but the aim with the distinctiveness test is to recognise innovation.\\n It directly addresses the need for greater differentiation between designs, both for registration and infringement purposes, that was evidenced by submissions, consultations and the [ALRC's] survey of design users.\\n \\n(Some formatting altered; footnotes moved to text in brackets.)\\n\\nThe ALRC Report formed the basis of the 2003 Designs Act: Explanatory Memorandum to the Designs Bill 2002 (Cth) at 1. Under the 2003 Designs Act, a design is distinctive \\\"unless it is substantially similar in overall impression to a design that forms part of the prior art base for the design\\\" as it existed before the priority date of each Design: s 16(2) (emphasis added). As noted earlier, that test has an important temporal aspect: anything which occurs after the priority date (the filing date of the application for registration) is irrelevant: s 16(3).\\n\\nThirdly, the judgment is an objective one. In assessing substantial similarity in overall impression, the standard to be applied is that of the informed user - namely, the court standing in the shoes of a notional person who is familiar with the product to which the design relates, or products similar to the product to which the design relates: s 19(4); Review 2 Pty Ltd v Redberry Enterprise Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1588 ; see also Dart Industries Inc v Decor Corporation Pty Ltd (1989) 15 IPR 403 , 408-409. That informed user , in assessing substantial similarity in overall impression: gives more weight to similarities between the designs than to differences between them: s 19(1); considers the state of development of the prior art base for the design: s 19(2)(a); considers the particular visual features of the design described in the statement of newness and distinctiveness in the context in which they appear: s 19(2)(b) and (c); if only part of the design is substantially similar to another design, considers the amount, quality and importance of that part in the context of the design as a whole: s 19(2)(c); and considers the freedom of the creator of the design to innovate: s 19(2)(d).\",\"15\":\"Thirdly, the second event, the 7 September 2007 letters, contained a threat of legal proceedings at a time when the current proceedings had already been on foot for some 5 months against Elecspess and AAA in respect of infringement of the Designs: see Elwood Clothing Pty Ltd v Cotton On Clothing Pty Ltd (2008) 76 IPR 83 at [41] and authorities there cited (stating that threats made after proceedings have already been instituted or that result in the bringing of proceedings are less likely to be deemed unjustified).\\n\\nFor those reasons, the cross-claimants' claim of unjustified threats of design infringement is rejected. TPA claims\\n\\nThe cross-claimants also claim that LED Tech and Mr Ottobre engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct. The conduct said to breach s 52 of the TPA comprised three separate events. LED Tech's website\",\"16\":\"In the circumstances, the better approach is to assess damages doing the best I can, even if such quantification necessarily involves a degree of speculation and guesswork: eg Placer (Granny Smith) Pty Ltd v Thiess Contractors Pty Ltd [2003] HCA 10 ; (2003) 196 ALR 257 at [37] - [38] ; Adidas-Solomon AG v Turner (2003) 58 IPR 66 at [4]-[5]; Enzed Holdings Ltd v Wynthea Pty Ltd (1984) 57 ALR 167 , 183; Sony Computer Entertainment Australia Pty Ltd v Stirling [2001] FCA 1852 at [7] .\",\"17\":\"The next matter to be considered is the claim of secondary liability of the Directors under the TPA. The principles are well established. Natural persons will be liable in damages for a contravention by a corporation if they had a \\\"close, rather than a remote involvement in the contravention\\\": Fencott v Muller [1983] HCA 12 ; (1983) 152 CLR 570 , 584. Moreover, the participation in the contravention requires actual, rather than constructive, knowledge of the essential matters that make up the contravention: Yorke v Lucas [1985] HCA 65 ; (1985) 158 CLR 661 , 666-670 and 677, Rural Press Ltd v ACCC [2002] FCAFC 213 ; (2002) 118 FCR 236 at [67] and Quinlivan v ACCC (2004) 160 FCR 1 at [8]-[9].\",\"18\":\"\",\"19\":\"The \\\"informed user\\\" concept has also been considered by the courts in the United Kingdom. In Woodhouse UK plc v Architectural Lighting Systems [2006] RPC 1 at [59], Judge Fysh QC of the Patents County Court defined an informed use r in the following terms: \\nFirst, this notional person must obviously be a user of articles of the sort which is subject of the registered design - and I would think, a regular user at that. He could thus be a consumer or buyer or be otherwise familiar with the subject matter say, through use at work. The quality smacks of practical considerations. In my view the informed user is first, a person to whom the design is directed. Evidently he is not a manufacturer of the articles and both counsel roundly rejected the candidature of \\\"the man in the street\\\". \\\" Informed \\\" to my mind adds a notion of familiarity with the relevant rather more than what one might expect of the average consumer; it imports the notion of \\\"what's about in the market?\\\" and \\\"what has been about in the recent past?\\\" I do not think it requires an archival mind (or eye) or more than an average memory but it does I think demand some awareness of product trend and availability and some knowledge of basic technical considerations (if any). In connection with the latter, one must not forget that we are in the territory of designs and thus what matters most is the appearance of things; as Mr Davis reminded me, these are not petty patents. Therefore, focus on eye appeal seems more pertinent than familiarity with the underlying operational or manufacturing technology (if any). I feel uncomfortable with analogy to the \\\"man skilled in the art\\\" whose \\\"nerd-like\\\" (and other) attributes seem too technical: Technip France SA's Patent [2004] EWCA Civ 381 ; [2004] R.P.C. 46 at [6-12] ( CA).\\n \\n \\nThis formulation was considered and approved by Lewison J in Proctor & Gamble Company 73 IPR 605 at [31], [32] and [41] and was also applied in Application by Pauline Ann Walton to invalidate UK Registered Design in the name of Zap Ltd [2007] ECDR 10. To the extent that it matters (and it might not), the Australian Designs Office (\\\"the ADO\\\") has indicated that the informed user concept is an objective test where the user is an ordinary or typical member of a sample of users of the product who is reasonably informed, being neither barely informed nor fully expert: Apple Computer Inc (2007) 74 IPR 164 and Icon Plastics Pty Ltd [2007] ADO 2 as discussed in Review 2 Pty Ltd v Redberry Enterprise Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1588 at [25] .\",\"20\":\"The \\\"informed user\\\" concept in the 2003 Designs Act has been the subject of recent judicial consideration in Australia: Review 2 Pty Ltd v Redberry Enterprise Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1588 at [19] - [27] ; Review Australia Pty Ltd v New Cover Group Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1589. It is a concept the ALRC borrowed from European Community Design law, now codified in Council Regulation (EC) No. 6\\/2002 and in the Registered Design Act 1949 (UK): see ALRC Report, para 5.17-5.21 and 6.12-6.13; Proctor & Gamble Company v Reckitt Benckiser (UK) Ltd (2007) 73 IPR 605 at [32] and J Choo (Jersey) Ltd v Towerstone Ltd [2008] FSR 19 at [7].\\n\\nThere is little doubt that first impressions are important when comparing a registered design with an allegedly infringing product in the manner prescribed by the 2003 Designs Act: ALRC Report para 5.15. In the United Kingdom, in applying an \\\"overall impression\\\" test, the approach is to hold a product embodying the registered design (provided that the Court is satisfied that it is a true embodiment of the registered design) and the alleged infringing product in hand and undertake a reasonably careful comparison between the two: Proctor & Gamble Company 73 IPR 605 at [12]. See also J Choo (Jersey) Ltd v Towerstone Ltd [2008] FSR 19 at [6] (citing Proctor & Gamble for the proposition that court may have regard to a physical embodiment of the registered design in making the comparison to the allegedly infringing product); but see Rolawn Lawn Ltd v Turfmech Machinery Ltd [2008] EWHC 989 Pat at [124] (stating that the exercise involves comparing the registered design to a photograph of the allegedly infringing product rather than the product itself).\",\"21\":\"The question is therefore whether, in all the circumstances, it would have been reasonable in this case for the Respondents to have searched the Register? In my view, it would have been. That conclusion is dependent on two findings. First, having regard to the substantial similarity between the Designs and the Condor Products and in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, it would be reasonably open to infer that a representative of Ren and Olsen (and for that matter, AAA and Elecspess) saw the commercial embodiment of the Design: Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298. Secondly and more importantly, the commercial embodiments of the Designs, in both their packaged and unpackaged form, contain a form of notice that would give rise at least to a duty to check the name LED Technologies on the Register. The notice is at the foot of the packaging and comprises the words \\\"Registered Design\\\". The rear of the base of each lamp has embossed on it a further notice, \\\"Design Certificate Registration Number [NUMBER STATED].\\\" There is no suggestion here that the notification on LED Tech's packaging was defective for s 75 purposes in any of the ways described by Kenny J or Jessup J: see Review 2 Pty Ltd v Redberry Enterprise Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1588 at [80] - [81] (accepting that a design notification affixed to the product, such as a swing tag, could be sufficient to put a potential infringer on notice but finding on the facts that there was not such notice at the relevant time); and Innovative at [48]-[52] (finding that the swing tag did put the infringer on notice, but refusing to take the notification into account in determining damages because the tag was misleading in part).\",\"22\":\"Secondly, contrary to the Respondents' submissions, distinctiveness is to be assessed not by comparing the design in question to the prior art base as a whole but by comparing it individually to each relevant piece of prior art: s 15(1) read with ss 16(1) and (2). Part 4 of Chapter 2 of the 2003 Designs Act must be read as a whole. The Respondents cannot, as they do, simply selectively choose ss 15(1) and 19(2) to support their contention that a comparison is made of the design with the totality of the entire relevant prior art base for that design whilst ignoring the express words of the rest of Pt 4 including ss 16 and 19(1). It is those sections which expressly provide that a design is distinctive unless it is substantially similar in overall impression to a design that forms part of the prior art base for the design. As a result, a design that combines various features, each of which can be found in the prior art base when considered as a whole but not in any one particular piece of prior art, is capable of being distinctive: Review 2 Pty Ltd v Redberry Enterprise Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1588 at [60] ; Karen Millen Ltd v Dunnes Stores Ltd [2008] ECDR 11 at [82]-[84] (stating that the registered design must be assessed with regard to particular prior designs rather than a hypothetical amalgam of a number of prior designs). See also Lockwood Security Products Pty Ltd v Doric Products Pty Ltd [2007] HCA 21 ; (2007) 235 ALR 202 (upholding the validity in the patent context of a combination of features known collectively in the prior art).\",\"23\":\"In LJ Fisher & Company Ltd v Fabtile Industries Pty Ltd (1978) 1A IPR 565 , 571-72, Fullagar J said: \\nI am clearly of opinion that a registered design in order to be valid, must be reasonably \\\"clear and succinct\\\"; that is to say the design sought to be monopolised by copyright must appear with reasonable clarity, and without necessity for unreasonably prolonged or complicated series of deductions, from the registered representation of an article to which the design has been applied. In argument in Phillips v Harbro Rubber Co (1920) 37 RPC 233 , Sir Duncan Kerly KC said: \\n \\n \\nA design may be valid for any form that is new, subject to this, that it must be distinct and present an appearance that strikes the eye as being different from any previously existing shape. [Emphasis added.]\\n \\n \\n... But in design law I think that the design is addressed to a person of some skill who might be called a person skilled in the art, but that a person skilled in the art is not necessarily familiar with particular methods of manufacture per se; I think he knows the prior art articles and the prior art registered designs and knows as much about manufacture as he would reasonably be expected to deduce from a study of those designs and articles, but not necessarily any more. ... I do think that if a design, depicted by reference to an article to which it has been applied, appears difficult to construe, evidence is admissible from persons familiar with those articles and with methods of applying designs to them, at all events where the design is as here confined to configuration. In what follows I use the expression \\\"person skilled in the art\\\" as a shorthand for a person with the elementary knowledge that I have above indicated; that is to say a person in the circumstances of this case, who is familiar at least with the shape and appearance and (so far as obvious) constituents of prior art roof tiles composed wholly or chiefly of metal, as known at the priority date of the registration.\\n \\n \\n (Emphasis added.)\\n\\nMuch of the cross-claimants' arguments proceeded from the premise that no sufficient representation of each Design appeared on IP Australia's website. The cross-claimants submitted that the visual features of the Designs were hard to discern when looking at the pink drawings. Mr Garrard, a consultant to the automotive electrical industry, was called to give evidence by the cross-claimants. He looked at the pink drawings on the IP Australia website and in the Certificates of Registration produced by the Designs Office tendered in evidence and initially said he had difficulty in understanding the features of the Designs such as the side profile of the base and the degree of rounding of the lens. In cross-examination, he modified that evidence to the extent of acknowledging that he was able to discern features of the Designs except for the curved ends. Other witnesses gave evidence about the pink drawings and what they could and could not discern from them. It is therefore necessary to examine the validity of the cross-claimants' premise that no sufficient representation of each Design appeared on IP Australia's website with some care.\\n\\nAs I noted earlier, printed representations of some of what was displayed when IP Australia's database was searched were tendered in evidence. Five different views of each Design were tendered. Even if one of those views were to be thought insufficient to convey to the observer all of the relevant features of the Design it by no means follows that the combination of images is necessarily deficient in that respect.\\n\\nIn my view, it is possible to discern from the printed representations the visual features of the Designs, including the two particular matters to which Mr Garrard drew special attention, the side profile of the base and the degree of rounding of the lens. Adopting the language of Fullagar J, I consider each Design to be reasonably \\\"clear and succinct\\\" . It may be said that the pink drawings are not perfect or that they could be better or clearer. However, each Design does appear with reasonable clarity, and without necessity for unreasonably prolonged or complicated series of deductions, from the registered representation of an article to which the design has been applied .\\n\\nIt is necessary to record, however, that the documents that were tendered show a particular magnification and resolution of the representations appearing in the database. Because the data is held electronically and displayed on the IP Australia website (in Adobe Reader as PDF documents), it is possible, within limits, to reproduce the representations at greater magnification than may first be displayed on the screen. That is, the printed exhibits cannot be taken as necessarily indicating the largest magnification or best resolution of what appears in the database and is accessible by the public. Again, it is possible to observe on IP Australia's website the five different views of each Design. When those views are displayed at higher magnifications, the details and specifications of each Design appear not just with reasonable clarity, but with great clarity.\\n\\nHowever, when I asked the parties after the hearing whether it would permissible for the Court to have regard to the magnified displays on the website (which were not tendered into evidence by way of printed or electronic copy), the Respondents contended that there was no evidence that the representations on the IP Australia website could be or were in fact magnified by any witness or that a member of the public seeking information as to a registered design would be expected to electronically magnify the online representations. I reject both contentions. First, there was evidence that witnesses had accessed the Designs on the IP Australia website and magnified the representations to some extent.\",\"24\":\"Secondly, contrary to the Respondents' submissions, distinctiveness is to be assessed not by comparing the design in question to the prior art base as a whole but by comparing it individually to each relevant piece of prior art: s 15(1) read with ss 16(1) and (2). Part 4 of Chapter 2 of the 2003 Designs Act must be read as a whole. The Respondents cannot, as they do, simply selectively choose ss 15(1) and 19(2) to support their contention that a comparison is made of the design with the totality of the entire relevant prior art base for that design whilst ignoring the express words of the rest of Pt 4 including ss 16 and 19(1). It is those sections which expressly provide that a design is distinctive unless it is substantially similar in overall impression to a design that forms part of the prior art base for the design. As a result, a design that combines various features, each of which can be found in the prior art base when considered as a whole but not in any one particular piece of prior art, is capable of being distinctive: Review 2 Pty Ltd v Redberry Enterprise Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1588 at [60] ; Karen Millen Ltd v Dunnes Stores Ltd [2008] ECDR 11 at [82]-[84] (stating that the registered design must be assessed with regard to particular prior designs rather than a hypothetical amalgam of a number of prior designs). See also Lockwood Security Products Pty Ltd v Doric Products Pty Ltd [2007] HCA 21 ; (2007) 235 ALR 202 (upholding the validity in the patent context of a combination of features known collectively in the prior art).\",\"25\":\"However, if LED Tech had established damage, I do not consider that each of Messrs Keller and Armstrong knew of the \\\"essential matters\\\" that enabled the representations to be characterised in the manner contended: ACCC v Kaye [2004] FCA 1363 at [182] - [186] . To adopt the language of the majority of the Full Court in Medical Benefits Fund of Australia Ltd v Cassidy [2003] FCAFC 289 ; (2003) 135 FCR 1 at [12-16] , although I accept that each of Messrs Keller and Armstrong knew (1) that the Condor Products were manufactured, sold and packaged and (2) the content of the manner in which they were sold which might lead members of at least one class of consumer to believe that the products complied with \\\"prescribed consumer product safety standards\\\", I do not conclude that either Messrs Keller or Armstrong knew the facts that meant that the Representations were not correct. As to the \\\"ADR Approved\\\" representation, they gave evidence as to their subjective understanding of the representation conveyed, which, while possibly negligent or even reckless, was not such as to suggest wilful blindness or actual knowledge of how a relevant purchaser might understand it. As to the \\\"Complies with ADR\\\" representation, their evidence (which I accept) was that they relied upon oral and written assurances from their Chinese manufacturer and testing laboratories which turned out to be belatedly or never substantiated. Was that conduct less than wise? - Yes. Was it negligent and possibly even reckless? - Again, yes. But on the current state of the authorities that is not sufficient to establish the actual knowledge necessary to establish accessorial liability under the TPA. Significantly, it was never put to either Mr Keller or Mr Armstrong during the course of cross-examination that they knew these \\\"essential matters\\\". Accordingly, even if LED Tech had established that the TPA contraventions had caused it damage, they could not establish the secondary liability of the Directors for those contraventions.\",\"26\":\"However, the question remains, what then is the Australian standard? One thing that does not inform the answer to this question is industry practice. A deal of evidence was led as to what automotive industry experts thought the ADRs required and how the industry tested for compliance in practice. The general thrust of this evidence was that the industry treated much of the removed sections as still being applicable. However, as the Court stated in MHG Plastic Industries v ACCC (2000) ATPR (Digest) 46-206 at [49], any industry practice adopted as to the testing of products against a safety standard cannot affect the proper construction of the requirements under the safety standard. As Emmett J said at first instance in that decision ( ACCC v MHG Plastic Industries Pty Ltd [1999] ATPR 41-712 at [22]), \\\" The Standard means what it says\\\" .\",\"27\":\"As submitted by counsel for the Directors, the test to be applied is far from certain. One line of cases adopts what is known as the \\\"direct or procure\\\" test ( Performing Right Society Ltd v Ciryl Theatrical Syndicate Ltd [1924] 1 KB 1 , 14-15, while the other line of cases adopts the test in Mentmore Manufacturing v National Merchandising Manufacturing (1978) 89 DLR (3d) 195 that a director is only personally liable if it is reasonable to conclude that the purpose of the director was not the direction of the manufacturing and selling activity of the company in the course of his relationship to it but the \\\"deliberate, wilful and knowing pursuit of a course of conduct that was likely to constitute infringement or reflected an indifference to the risk of it\\\": at 204-205.\\n\\nIn Allen Manufacturing Co Pty Ltd v McCallum & Co Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1838 ; (2001) 53 IPR 400 at [39] , a design infringement case, the Full Court of the Federal Court considered the two tests in the following terms: \\nThe authorities were collected and analysed by Beazley J in King v Milpurrurru (1996) 66 FCR 474 at 494-500..... Her Honour noted the existence of two lines of authority. One line supported what she called the \\\"Performing Right Society test \\\" : whether the director had \\\"directed or procured\\\" the company's infringement. The other line supported \\\"the Mentmore test\\\": whether the director had engaged in \\\"the deliberate, wilful and knowing pursuit of a course of conduct that was likely to constitute infringement or reflected an indifference to the risk of it\\\". Beazley J expressed a preference for the Mentmore test, on the basis that the Performing Right Society test did not \\\"pay sufficient regard, either to the separate legal existence of the company, or to the fact that the company acts through its directors\\\": see [66 FCR at 500]. However, this preference had no immediate consequence; her Honour held (again at [500]) that the appellants were not liable under either test.\\n\\nAfter listing a number of cases (at [40]-[41]) supporting each approach and considering the submissions of the parties, the Full Court went on to say (at [43]-[44]): \\nThe difference between the two tests may be more apparent than real. We are not aware of any case in which it has been held that a director or officer of a company directed or procured the company's infringing act, yet that person escaped liability because he or she did not deliberately, wilfully or knowingly pursue a course of conduct that was likely to constitute infringement or that reflected indifference to the risk of infringement. This may be because, in practice, an act of direction or procurement will generally meet the Mentmore test. It is notable that, in Mentmore itself, the Canadian Federal Court of Appeal declined (at 204) to \\\"go so far as to hold that the director or officer must know or have reason to know that the acts which he directs or procures constitute infringement\\\". The Court declined to do this because that \\\"would be to impose a condition of liability that does not exist for patent infringement generally\\\". \\n \\n \\nTo the extent there is a real difference between the tests, each has eloquent supporters. One day it may be necessary, in a practical sense, to choose between them. But it is not necessary to do so in this case.\\n\\nThe position here is the same. This is not a case in which Messrs Keller and Armstrong acted only as directors of the infringing companies. Each had personal knowledge of the Designs and of the other facts and matters set out above (see [169]). To adopt the language of the Full Court, it was clear that each of Messrs Keller and Armstrong \\\"was personally an actor invading [LED Tech's] rights: by creating the [Condor Products]\\\" and taking the other steps outlined above. These sequences of actions were \\\"the deliberate, wilful and knowing pursuit of a course of conduct\\\" that was likely to constitute infringement or, at least, reflected a conscious indifference to the risk of infringement. As a result, each of the Directors also engaged in the design infringement. Each is a joint tortfeasor to the design infringement as each had \\\"a common design\\\" with Ren and Olsen to infringe the Designs and is jointly and severally liable to LED Tech for the damages assessed. Secondary liability under the TPA\",\"28\":\"The relevant legal principles are well known. A two-step analysis is required.

He could thus be a consumer or buyer or be otherwise familiar with the subject matter say, through use at work. The quality smacks of practical considerations. In my view the informed user is first, a person to whom the design is directed. Evidently he is not a manufacturer of the articles and both counsel roundly rejected the candidature of \\\"the man in the street\\\". \\\" Informed \\\" to my mind adds a notion of familiarity with the relevant rather more than what one might expect of the average consumer; it imports the notion of \\\"what's about in the market?\\\" and \\\"what has been about in the recent past?\\\" I do not think it requires an archival mind (or eye) or more than an average memory but it does I think demand some awareness of product trend and availability and some knowledge of basic technical considerations (if any). In connection with the latter, one must not forget that we are in the territory of designs and thus what matters most is the appearance of things; as Mr Davis reminded me, these are not petty patents.

I feel uncomfortable with analogy to the \\\"man skilled in the art\\\" whose \\\"nerd-like\\\" (and other) attributes seem too technical: Technip France SA's Patent [2004] EWCA Civ 381 ; [2004] R.P.C. 46 at [6-12] ( CA).\\n \\n \\nThis formulation was considered and approved by Lewison J in Proctor & Gamble Company 73 IPR 605 at [31], [32] and [41] and was also applied in Application by Pauline Ann Walton to invalidate UK Registered Design in the name of Zap Ltd [2007] ECDR 10.

In the United Kingdom, in applying an \\\"overall impression\\\" test, the approach is to hold a product embodying the registered design (provided that the Court is satisfied that it is a true embodiment of the registered design) and the alleged infringing product in hand and undertake a reasonably careful comparison between the two: Proctor & Gamble Company 73 IPR 605 at [12]. See also J Choo (Jersey) Ltd v Towerstone Ltd [2008] FSR 19 at [6] (citing Proctor & Gamble for the proposition that court may have regard to a physical embodiment of the registered design in making the comparison to the allegedly infringing product); but see Rolawn Lawn Ltd v Turfmech Machinery Ltd [2008] EWHC 989 Pat at [124] (stating that the exercise involves comparing the registered design to a photograph of the allegedly infringing product rather than the product itself).\",\"35\":\"How then does one assess the overall impression of a design in infringement proceedings? As noted earlier, until recently there has been little Australian judicial consideration of the 2003 Designs Act. The principal cases to date include Review 2 Pty Ltd v Redberry Enterprise Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1588 ; Review Australia Pty Ltd v Innovative Lifestyle Investments Pty Ltd (2008) 166 FCR 358 ; Review Australia Pty Ltd v New Cover Group Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1589 and World of Technologies (Aust) Pty Ltd v Tempo (Aust) Pty Ltd (2007) 71 IPR 307.\\n\\nIn Review Australia Pty Ltd v Innovative Lifestyle Investments Pty Ltd (2008) 166 FCR 358 ( Innovative ), Jessup J concluded that the word make in s 71(1) also includes those who direct, cause, or procure an infringing item to be made as well as those who make such an item themselves: Innovative at [21]. At first glance, therefore, it would seem that Ren and Olsen would be considered primary infringers. Although they did not make the products themselves, they directed, caused, or procured the Condor lights to be made by issuing purchase orders to their Chinese suppliers based on samples, designs, or other specifications. Elecspess and AAA, having only sold the products, would be secondary infringers.\\n\\nI say \\\"at first glance,\\\" however, because in the Review cases, Kenny J added an important qualification to Jessup J's holding in Innovative . Her Honour noted the long-standing common law presumption, codified in s 21(1)(b) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth), that statutes are to be read as being confined to their operation within territorial limits: Review 2 Pty Ltd v Redberry Enterprise Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1588 at [77] ; Review Australia Pty Ltd v New Cover Group Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1589 at [48] . Although the Respondents in this case did not raise any extraterritoriality issue, I consider it appropriate to do so because the parties did not have the benefit of Kenny J's judgment at the time of trial and because the issue relates to the Court's jurisdiction - that is, it goes to a matter in respect of which the Court is required to satisfy itself regardless of the parties' submissions or lack thereof.\\n\\nFor those reasons, Ren and Olsen could not be considered primary infringers, even though they procured the making of the infringing Condor lights, because the actual manufacture occurred outside of Australia. That is not to say that they would therefore escape liability completely. Rather, each of Elecspess, AAA, Ren and Olsen must be considered secondary infringers on the basis of their having imported (in the case of Ren and Olsen) or offered for sale (in the case of all four) in Australia the infringing Condor lights. I would consider the Director Respondents as secondary infringers as well, on a similar basis as that given by Jessup J in Innovative - namely, that importing or selling, as the case may be, should be understood to also include directing, causing, or procuring an infringing item to be imported or sold. The relevant provision of s 75 is therefore s 75(2)(b). That subsection requires the court to consider, in determining whether an affirmative defence is available, whether a secondary infringer was aware or could not reasonably have been expected to have been aware that the design was registered.\\n\\nAssuming that Ren and Olsen in fact had taken no steps to ascertain whether the Designs were registered at the time of the infringing conduct, that fact alone might not have disentitled them to rely upon the affirmative defence. The language of s 75(2)(b) (\\\"could reasonably have been expected to be aware\\\") shows that a Court cannot assume that there is always an affirmative duty to search the Register. Such a possibility was referred to by the ALRC at par 14.16 of its Report in the following terms: \\nThe register provides notice to the world that a design is registered. If a defendant has not searched the register, the court may conclude under s 32B that a search was a reasonable step that the defendant had neglected to take . It should not be mandatory for persons who claim innocence in infringement to search the register . However in exercising its discretion, the court may take into account whether it was reasonable in all the circumstances for a search to have been conducted.\\n \\n \\n(Emphasis added.)\\n\\nThe ALRC added at par 14.17, \\\"It would be inappropriate for a retailer or importer, who may deal with a variety of products, to be required to check whether the products' designs have all been registered.\\\" I accept that it would be inappropriate to impose a per se duty on secondary infringers. However, in my view, there will be circumstances where a secondary infringer should reasonably be expected to check whether the products' designs have been registered. If, having checked, they would have ascertained the limits of the monopoly (which is the case here), then they would not be able to make out the affirmative defence.\\n\\nThe question is therefore whether, in all the circumstances, it would have been reasonable in this case for the Respondents to have searched the Register? In my view, it would have been. That conclusion is dependent on two findings. First, having regard to the substantial similarity between the Designs and the Condor Products and in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, it would be reasonably open to infer that a representative of Ren and Olsen (and for that matter, AAA and Elecspess) saw the commercial embodiment of the Design: Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298. Secondly and more importantly, the commercial embodiments of the Designs, in both their packaged and unpackaged form, contain a form of notice that would give rise at least to a duty to check the name LED Technologies on the Register. The notice is at the foot of the packaging and comprises the words \\\"Registered Design\\\". The rear of the base of each lamp has embossed on it a further notice, \\\"Design Certificate Registration Number [NUMBER STATED].\\\" There is no suggestion here that the notification on LED Tech's packaging was defective for s 75 purposes in any of the ways described by Kenny J or Jessup J: see Review 2 Pty Ltd v Redberry Enterprise Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1588 at [80] - [81] (accepting that a design notification affixed to the product, such as a swing tag, could be sufficient to put a potential infringer on notice but finding on the facts that there was not such notice at the relevant time); and Innovative at [48]-[52] (finding that the swing tag did put the infringer on notice, but refusing to take the notification into account in determining damages because the tag was misleading in part).\",\"36\":\"The \\\"informed user\\\" concept in the 2003 Designs Act has been the subject of recent judicial consideration in Australia: Review 2 Pty Ltd v Redberry Enterprise Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1588 at [19] - [27] ; Review Australia Pty Ltd v New Cover Group Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1589.

Part 4 of Chapter 2 of the 2003 Designs Act must be read as a whole. The Respondents cannot, as they do, simply selectively choose ss 15(1) and 19(2) to support their contention that a comparison is made of the design with the totality of the entire relevant prior art base for that design whilst ignoring the express words of the rest of Pt 4 including ss 16 and 19(1). It is those sections which expressly provide that a design is distinctive unless it is substantially similar in overall impression to a design that forms part of the prior art base for the design. As a result, a design that combines various features, each of which can be found in the prior art base when considered as a whole but not in any one particular piece of prior art, is capable of being distinctive: Review 2 Pty Ltd v Redberry Enterprise Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1588 at [60] ; Karen Millen Ltd v Dunnes Stores Ltd [2008] ECDR 11 at [82]-[84] (stating that the registered design must be assessed with regard to particular prior designs rather than a hypothetical amalgam of a number of prior designs). See also Lockwood Security Products Pty Ltd v Doric Products Pty Ltd [2007] HCA 21 ; (2007) 235 ALR 202 (upholding the validity in the patent context of a combination of features known collectively in the prior art).\\n\\nThirdly, the judgment is an objective one. In assessing substantial similarity in overall impression, the standard to be applied is that of the informed user - namely, the court standing in the shoes of a notional person who is familiar with the product to which the design relates, or products similar to the product to which the design relates: s 19(4); Review 2 Pty Ltd v Redberry Enterprise Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1588 ; see also Dart Industries Inc v Decor Corporation Pty Ltd (1989) 15 IPR 403 , 408-409. That informed user , in assessing substantial similarity in overall impression: gives more weight to similarities between the designs than to differences between them: s 19(1); considers the state of development of the prior art base for the design: s 19(2)(a); considers the particular visual features of the design described in the statement of newness and distinctiveness in the context in which they appear: s 19(2)(b) and (c); if only part of the design is substantially similar to another design, considers the amount, quality and importance of that part in the context of the design as a whole: s 19(2)(c); and considers the freedom of the creator of the design to innovate: s 19(2)(d).\\n\\nThe \\\"informed user\\\" concept in the 2003 Designs Act has been the subject of recent judicial consideration in Australia: Review 2 Pty Ltd v Redberry Enterprise Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1588 at [19] - [27] ; Review Australia Pty Ltd v New Cover Group Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1589.

First and most importantly, such an approach is inconsistent with the statutory language. Section 71(1)(a) directs the court to perform the substantial similarity analysis by comparing a product (the allegedly infringing item) to the registered design. Secondly, Jacob LJ's approach is inconsistent with that taken by Kenny J in Review 2 Pty Ltd v Redberry Enterprise Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1588 at [28] , [35]. Significantly, the expert evidence in Review was challenged on the basis that the witness had improperly compared product with product (and had even tried the products on): see [33]. Although Kenny J ultimately allowed the evidence, her Honour nevertheless proceeded on the basis that the comparison for the court was between registered design and product and the expert evidence in question had to be taken subject to the complaints made by the other side: see [34]-[36].\\n\\nI am of a similar view. While there may be circumstances in which it is appropriate (or at least not wholly inappropriate) for an expert witness giving evidence as an informed user to have regard to a product embodying the registered design in providing an opinion on the substantial similarity question, the task for the court itself as laid down by the statute remains to compare the registered design to the allegedly infringing product. Moreover, even if I were not inclined to the view of Kenny J, I could not, in light of the statutory language, consider her Honour's approach plainly wrong, and thus I would follow it in preference to Jacob LJ's approach in any event.\\n\\nI therefore conclude that infringement is determined by comparing the allegedly infringing product against the registered design, not by comparing a product embodying the registered design against the infringing product: s 71. Thus the fact that the actual LED light is similar to the Condor TL light is not relevant. Moreover, infringement is determined by comparing only the visible features of the design to the infringing product: ss 7 and 19. Thus the fact that the products have different materials in the lens or have different voltages is also irrelevant.\\n\\nIf a visual comparison is made of the top view of a Condor product (such as the TL80ARW) against the registered design (eg figures 1, 2, 3 and 4 of 6 in Annexure A), the Condor product is \\\"substantially similar in overall impression\\\" to the Designs: s 71(1)(a) of the 2003 Designs Act. There is a continuous base. There is a flat strip or landing between each lens. The sides of the base of both the Designs and the Condor product comprise a sloping, rounded mounting bracket surrounding the lenses.\\n\\nI say \\\"at first glance,\\\" however, because in the Review cases, Kenny J added an important qualification to Jessup J's holding in Innovative . Her Honour noted the long-standing common law presumption, codified in s 21(1)(b) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth), that statutes are to be read as being confined to their operation within territorial limits: Review 2 Pty Ltd v Redberry Enterprise Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1588 at [77] ; Review Australia Pty Ltd v New Cover Group Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1589 at [48] .

The approach may be summarised in six points, as follows:\",\"44\":\"Notwithstanding that one or more of the Representations conveyed was false, misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive, LED Tech's claims under the TPA fail because LED Tech did not establish an essential element of the cause of action damage: Wardley Australia Ltd v Western Australia [1992] HCA 55 ; (1992) 175 CLR 514 , 525 (per Mason CJ). Although never properly articulated, the causation and damages theory of LED Tech's TPA claims seemed to be a lost sales theory similar to that underpinning the infringement claim: (1) (a) consumers prefer to buy, or (b) in some cases will only buy; (2) products that are marked as complying with applicable safety standards and that do comply with those standards; (3) LED Tech's lamps comply with the ADRs; (4) had it been known to the market that the Corporate Respondents' products did not comply with the ADRs (ie if they did not bear the Captions); (5) all those who purchased the Corporate Respondents' products; (6) would instead have purchased LED Tech's lamps; (7) such that the Representations caused LED Tech to lose sales in the amount of the Corporate Respondents' sales.\\n\\nAs noted earlier, LED Tech's claim seemed to assume that every sale made by the Corporate Respondents of a Condor Product would have been a sale that LED Tech would have made. That is not an assumption that can be made in the infringement context, and it is even more remote in the TPA context. It is not supported by human experience or, more importantly, by the evidence. As I noted at the outset, the market in Australia for LED automotive lamps was highly competitive. There was evidence that certain large manufacturers would only buy from suppliers holding CRNs; however, there was no evidence to show that ordinary consumers, particularly aftermarket consumers, considered safety compliance to be so material as to prevail over factors such as price and convenience.\\n\\nFurthermore, it goes without saying that LED Tech's lost sales, whatever the precise number of units, cannot be double counted. In no event could they be more than the number of units actually sold by the Corporate Respondents. As noted earlier, I calculated infringement damages based on the assumption that the Respondents' sales data reflected the number of units actually sold by them, less a certain (not precisely quantifiable) discount based on the fact that their data was on the conservative side. To receive any damages under the TPA over and above the infringement award, LED Tech would have to satisfy the Court that the TPA contraventions caused it to lose additional sales.\",\"45\":\"The \\\"informed user\\\" concept has also been considered by the courts in the United Kingdom. In Woodhouse UK plc v Architectural Lighting Systems [2006] RPC 1 at [59], Judge Fysh QC of the Patents County Court defined an informed use r in the following terms: \\nFirst, this notional person must obviously be a user of articles of the sort which is subject of the registered design - and I would think, a regular user at that. He could thus be a consumer or buyer or be otherwise familiar with the subject matter say, through use at work. The quality smacks of practical considerations. In my view the informed user is first, a person to whom the design is directed. Evidently he is not a manufacturer of the articles and both counsel roundly rejected the candidature of \\\"the man in the street\\\". \\\" Informed \\\" to my mind adds a notion of familiarity with the relevant rather more than what one might expect of the average consumer; it imports the notion of \\\"what's about in the market?\\\" and \\\"what has been about in the recent past?\\\" I do not think it requires an archival mind (or eye) or more than an average memory but it does I think demand some awareness of product trend and availability and some knowledge of basic technical considerations (if any). In connection with the latter, one must not forget that we are in the territory of designs and thus what matters most is the appearance of things; as Mr Davis reminded me, these are not petty patents. Therefore, focus on eye appeal seems more pertinent than familiarity with the underlying operational or manufacturing technology (if any). I feel uncomfortable with analogy to the \\\"man skilled in the art\\\" whose \\\"nerd-like\\\" (and other) attributes seem too technical: Technip France SA's Patent [2004] EWCA Civ 381 ; [2004] R.P.C. 46 at [6-12] ( CA).\\n \\n \\nThis formulation was considered and approved by Lewison J in Proctor & Gamble Company 73 IPR 605 at [31], [32] and [41] and was also applied in Application by Pauline Ann Walton to invalidate UK Registered Design in the name of Zap Ltd [2007] ECDR 10. To the extent that it matters (and it might not), the Australian Designs Office (\\\"the ADO\\\") has indicated that the informed user concept is an objective test where the user is an ordinary or typical member of a sample of users of the product who is reasonably informed, being neither barely informed nor fully expert: Apple Computer Inc (2007) 74 IPR 164 and Icon Plastics Pty Ltd [2007] ADO 2 as discussed in Review 2 Pty Ltd v Redberry Enterprise Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1588 at [25] .\",\"46\":\"The second item is in fact a group of items published by the Administrator and known as \\\"Circulars\\\". The Circulars do not have legislative or regulatory force. The Court cannot have regard to them under s 143 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth). What then is the status of the Circulars? One was tendered in evidence (Circular 0-4-26). Others (Circulars 0-2-11, 0-3-2, 0-3-4, 0-3-6, 0-4-18, 0-12-0 and 0-13-1) were provided to the Court following the hearing, although leave to reopen for the purpose of tendering them was neither sought nor granted. I have read the Circulars. They do not contain matters \\\"so generally known that every person may be reasonably presumed to be aware\\\" of them: Woods v Multi-Sport Holdings Pty Ltd [2002] HCA 9 ; (2002) 208 CLR 460 at [64] (per McHugh J). Accordingly, the Court cannot have regard to them under s 144 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth). Putting Circular 0-4-26 to one side, the other Circulars are therefore not properly before the Court and I have not relied on them in coming to the views expressed in these reasons.\\n\\nCircular 0-4-26 is entitled \\\"Application for Component Registration Numbers (CRNs)\\\". It \\\"sets out the requirements and conditions regarding the application for, and issuing of, [CRNs] for vehicle components\\\": par 1.1. Applicants for a CRN can be the component manufacturer, component supplier or the vehicle manufacturer: par 1.5. The CRN process is directed at registering vehicle components to be used in new motor vehicles. The Department of Transport and Regional Services (now known as the Department of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Services) (\\\"DOTARS\\\") creates a register of components that are commonly used in new vehicles for administrative convenience.\\n\\nThe Circular provides that the Administrator of Vehicle Standards will accept CRNs as evidence of compliance in Summary of Evidence submissions. What those submissions are or the use to which they are put, is not explained. In any event, CRNs will only be issued for components that are fitted to new motor vehicles or trailers (par 1.4) and for, inter alia, \\\"(i) Lighting and light signalling devices (various ADRs)\\\": par 1.6. However, CRNs will not be issued for lighting and light-signalling devices using UNECE (United Nations Economic Committee for Europe) regulation approvals (par 1.7) or for components exclusively for the aftermarket (par 1.8). The Circular then goes on to specify the manner in which an applicant applies for a CRN. For example, a separate application is required for each Make-Model and, in the case of combined lighting and signalling devices, separate applications are also required for each different function (eg stop, position or indicator): par 2.4.\",\"47\":\"How then does one assess the overall impression of a design in infringement proceedings? As noted earlier, until recently there has been little Australian judicial consideration of the 2003 Designs Act. The principal cases to date include Review 2 Pty Ltd v Redberry Enterprise Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1588 ; Review Australia Pty Ltd v Innovative Lifestyle Investments Pty Ltd (2008) 166 FCR 358 ; Review Australia Pty Ltd v New Cover Group Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1589 and World of Technologies (Aust) Pty Ltd v Tempo (Aust) Pty Ltd (2007) 71 IPR 307.\",\"48\":\"The next matter to be considered is the claim of secondary liability of the Directors under the TPA.
