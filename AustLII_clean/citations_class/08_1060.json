As noted by Black CJ, Sheppard and Einfeld JJ in Microbio Resources Inc v Betatene Ltd (Unreported, FCA, 8 October 1993):\\n The Court is careful to see that orders for security for costs do not work injustice to parties against whom such orders are made, but if those parties do not comply with the orders and give no evidence or explanation as to why they have not complied with them, they cannot be heard to complain of injustice if, after a considerable length of time, and extensions of time, the ultimate sanction of dismissal is applied.

The Court undoubtedly has power to vary orders previously made, including a power to vary the time at which security is to be provided: Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), s 56(3) ; Federal Court Rules , O 28, r 5(2). As to the practice of the Court and the circumstances in which that power may be exercised, in Truth about Motorways Pty Ltd v Macquarie Infrastructure Investment Management Ltd [2001] FCA 1603 , Hely J observed:\\n [11] It is clear from the terms of O28 r5(2) that the Court has power to set aside or vary the original security for costs order. The Court retains jurisdiction, because of the very nature of an interlocutory order, to set aside, vary or discharge it up to the time of the final disposition of the proceedings. However, as McLelland J recognised in Brimaud v Honeysett Instant Print Pty Ltd (1988) 6 ACLC 942 , it would be conducive to great injustice and enormous waste of judicial time and resources if there were no limit on the power of a party to have any interlocutory application or order relitigated at will. Hence the ordinary practice is that an application to set aside, vary or discharge an order of a substantive nature made after a contested hearing in contemplation that it would operate until a final disposition of the proceedings, must be founded on a material change of circumstances since the original application was heard, or the discovery of new material which could not reasonably have been put before the Court on the hearing of the original application. That principle was applied by a Full Court of this Court in Darling Harbourside (Sydney) Pty Ltd v Sanirise Pty Ltd (unreported, Beaumont, Carr, Sackville JJ, 17 May 1996) to an order for the provision of security for costs. The Full Court set aside an order varying an order for the provision of security upon the basis that there had been no material change in circumstances established so as to warrant a variation of the original order. \\nSee also: Capital Webworks Pty Ltd v Adultshop.com.Limited [2008] FCA 40 at [12] per McKerracher J.\",\"3\":\"12 The Affidavit as filed by the Appellant on 16 July 2008 opposing an order dismissing the proceeding provides no reason for not making that order and provides no explanation as to why the orders previously made have not been complied with.

Those orders required security to be provided at two stages -- the first stage required 50% of the security to be provided within 21 days of those orders being made; the second stage required the balance of the security to be provided 21 days prior to the hearing of the appeal to this Court from a decision of the Federal Magistrates Court: Lawrance v Commonwealth (No 5) [2007] FMCA 1934.\\n\\n8 Today the Appellant has frankly -- and quite properly -- conceded that she remains unable to meet any order requiring security to be provided. Her position is that the present proceeding should remain stayed as she may ultimately prevail in a number of other proceedings she is pursuing in the Federal Magistrates Court. If ultimately successful in those other proceedings, she contends that it would be unjust to have the present proceeding in this Court dismissed. Whatever success the Appellant may or may not have in those other proceedings, however, is a matter to be resolved in those other proceedings. Appropriate orders will be made by the Federal Magistrates Court to resolve those proceedings. They have no relevance to the present proceeding, other than to possibly support a submission advanced by the Respondents that the continued pursuit of the present proceeding is either vexatious or an abuse of process. It is, however, unnecessary to resolve those submissions. For present purposes it is sufficient to note that in the reasons for decision as published on 4 April 2008 it was then concluded that none of the grounds of appeal sought to be pursued in this Court had \\\" any real prospects of success \\\": [2008] FCA 417 at [26] .
