The phrase, although lacking precision, is sufficiently understood not to require judicial gloss.\\n\\nI refrain, in this case, from adding any judicial gloss in respect of the term \\\"special circumstances\\\". It seems to me that that which has earlier fallen from courts as to what those words carry with them is more than sufficient.\\n\\nWhen one reads the reasons of the learned Federal Magistrate insofar as they address the subject of the special circumstances aspect of the controversy which fell to the AAT to resolve one is left, in my opinion, with two impressions. Firstly, that the learned Federal Magistrate correctly apprehended the nature of the special circumstances test which fell for the AAT to apply, and secondly, that the learned Federal Magistrate did appreciate that that test fell for application in the circumstances of Mr Doelle's particular case.\\n\\nIn particular, at para 13 of the reasons for judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court, one finds the following: The facts were considered against the established test with the tribunal concluding, at para 20:\\n \\n\\\"... there is no or insufficient probative evidence that the applicant's circumstance are somehow unusual or exceptional such that there are \\\"special circumstances\\\" enough to warrant the debt being waived.\\\"\\n\\nOne then finds the following observation made by the learned Federal Magistrate: \\n Despite the contention in his notice of appeal that the AAT incorrectly interpreted and\\/or applied the meaning of the expression \\\"special circumstances\\\" in section 1184K of the SS Act no particulars were advanced in support of that contention. The Tribunal correctly informed itself of the relevant test and its determination was open to it on the facts of the case. Ultimately the conclusion drawn by the AAT was one of fact.\",\"1\":\"Given the nature of that challenge, it is helpful to reflect upon observations which have been made in earlier judgments as to the nature of a special circumstances test. In Boscolo v Secretary, Department of Social Security [1999] FCA 106 ; (1999) 90 FCR 531 at 535, French J, as his Honour then was, observed: \\n It is generally futile to search for its meaning in terms of other words. It is in essence instrumental, a direction to the decision-maker that the discretion it is not likely to be enlivened... If helpful to speak in terms of its meaning almost all of it comes from context.\\n\\nI note that the learned Federal Magistrate made particular reference, at para 10 of his reasons for judgment, to Boscolo's case.\",\"2\":\"In this regard, it is helpful to recall observations made, now long ago, by Brennan J, as his Honour then was, in Waterford v Commonwealth of Australia [1987] HCA 25 ; (1987) 163 CLR 54 at 77, which statement was referred to with approval in this Court in Commonwealth Banking Corporation v Percival [1988] FCA 240 ; (1988) 20 FCR 176: \\n The error of law which an appellant must rely on to succeed must arise in the facts as the AAT has found them to be, or it must vitiate the findings made, or it must have led the AAT to omit to make a finding it was legally required to make. There is no error of law simply in making a wrong finding of fact. Therefore, an appellant cannot supplement the record by adducing fresh evidence merely in order to demonstrate an error of fact.\",\"3\":\"Later, in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Elton (1990) ATC 4078, Davies J observed that although he might have come to a different view on the facts had he been called upon to make the decision, no error of law was demonstrated. His Honour there, as others have frequently done since in respect of appeals under s 44 , was demonstrating a principle of restraint in terms of the jurisdiction that is consigned to the court in appeals from the AAT. It seems to me that the learned Federal Magistrate did just that in disposing with this aspect of the challenge which Mr Doelle made to the AAT's decision. Thus, those grounds of appeal which seek to challenge the way in which the Federal Magistrates Court dealt with the findings of fact made by the AAT must fail.\\n\\nIt is convenient, having regard to the reference to Waterford's case, to make brief reference to an endeavour which Mr Doelle made to supplement the record of the proceedings by proffering a document which I marked for identification as exhibit A. Mr Doelle did not give sworn evidence that this document comprised part of the record before the AAT, and, in a statement which he made from the bar table, was unable to confirm one way or the other whether it was, indeed, part of the material before the AAT. The Commonwealth's position was that it did not comprise part of the material before the AAT. It certainly did not form part of the material which was transmitted to the Court by the AAT, as required, in respect of an appeal under s 44.\",\"4\":\"In Groth v Secretary, Department of Social Security [1995] FCA 1708 ; (1995) 40 ALD 541 at 545, Kiefel J observed that: \\n The words require something which distinguishes [a person's] case from others, to take it out of the usual or ordinary case.\",\"5\":\"In Jess v Scott (1986) 12 FCR 187 at 195, albeit in a different context but, nonetheless, by reference to the term \\\"special circumstances,\\\" a Full Court observed of that term that: \\n [It is] an elastic test, suitable for application across a range of situations ... It is an expression describing a flexible discretionary power, but one requiring a case to be made upon grounds sufficient to justify departure in the particular circumstances from the ordinary rule.\",\"6\":\"A similar view of the meaning of a term such as \\\"special circumstances\\\" is to be found in the judgment of the Full Court in Minister for Community Services and Health v Chi Keong Thoo (1988) 78 ALR 307 at 324.\",\"7\":\"Having regard to the decision of the High Court in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia [2001] HCA 17 ; (2001) 205 CLR 507 , and subsequent decisions of Full Courts of this Court, there can be no doubt that an appeal to this Court from the Federal Magistrates Court is an appeal by way of rehearing, not an appeal stricto sensu . That said, the nature of the appellate jurisdiction is necessarily influenced by the nature of the proceeding which is the subject of appeal. In this instance, that proceeding was an appeal on a question of law. It seems to me to follow, having regard to the observation made by Brennan J in Waterford's case, that it would be impermissible, on an appeal from the Federal Magistrates Court which had entertained an appeal under s 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act , to receive, by way of an endeavour to supplement the record, material which could only go to a challenge to the factual conclusion reached by the AAT. For those reasons, I have not had regard to exhibit A in the disposition of the appeal.\\n\\nI turn, then, to the question which necessarily confronted the learned Federal Magistrate, in light of the conclusion which he had reached concerning the ability, reasonably, of the AAT to make the finding of fact that it did in relation to the composition of the settlement moneys. His Honour correctly apprehended that s 1184K of the Social Security Act makes provision for the exercise of discretion in relation to the imposition of the lump sum preclusion period refund obligations, where \\\"special circumstances\\\" exist. It seems to me, also, that his Honour correctly apprehended the case law, such as it is, as to the meaning of that term \\\"special circumstances.\\\"\\n\\nOne finds in para 8 and para 10 of the learned Federal Magistrate's reasons reference to pertinent authorities. His Honour recites, at para 9 of his reasons for judgment, that no issue was taken with the AAT's identification of the appropriate test. Before me, Mr Doelle was concerned that the learned Federal Magistrate had not dealt with the special circumstances test correctly, in that, so he submitted, the court below had failed to appreciate that the ramification of the special circumstances test was that each case is different. In other words, the nature of the challenge seemed to be that the court below and, for that matter, the AAT, had failed to appreciate that it was at the very essence of the special circumstances test that it required the consideration of its application in the circumstances of a particular case.\",\"8\":\"A cautionary note was sounded by Hill J in Secretary Department of Social Security v Hodgson [1992] FCA 338 ; (1992) 37 FCR 32 at 42 in his Honour's observation that the term carried with it: \\n ...no requirement that the case be extremely unusual, uncommon or exceptional. [emphasis added]\",\"9\":\"In this regard, it is helpful to recall observations made, now long ago, by Brennan J, as his Honour then was, in Waterford v Commonwealth of Australia [1987] HCA 25 ; (1987) 163 CLR 54 at 77, which statement was referred to with approval in this Court in Commonwealth Banking Corporation v Percival [1988] FCA 240 ; (1988) 20 FCR 176: \\n The error of law which an appellant must rely on to succeed must arise in the facts as the AAT has found them to be, or it must vitiate the findings made, or it must have led the AAT to omit to make a finding it was legally required to make.
