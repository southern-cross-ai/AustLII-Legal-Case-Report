As the learned Federal Magistrate observed, the appellant was unable to point to any documents or information which would have fallen within the provisions of s 424A(1).\",\"2\":\"18 Even if there was information which fell within s 424A(1) of the Migration Act , the information about China's one child policy dealt with an exception contained in s 424A(3)(a) ; see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v NAMW [2004] FCAFC 264 ; (2004) 140 FCR 572 at [138] .\\n\\n19 I am mindful of the fact that the appellant is not legally represented. I have given careful consideration to the reasons for decision of the Tribunal and the reasons given by the Federal Magistrate.

That may be an attempt to raise the ground to which the learned Federal Magistrate referred, namely a failure to make a genuine and realistic attempt to reach a bona fide decision. However, as the Full Court said in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Anthonypillai [2001] FCA 274 ; (2001) 106 FCR 426 at [65] , that language does not create a kind of general warrant for review. It seems to me that what is meant by such a ground is that the decision-maker must not inflexibly apply a policy. There is no such suggestion in the present case.\\n\\n13 The second ground of appeal is that the Tribunal did not provide an opportunity to the appellant to comment on materials which the Tribunal relied upon in its decision and that the Tribunal made an error of procedural fairness in relation to the case. In addition, the notice of appeal states that the Federal Magistrates Court failed to give consideration to this claim. This ground of appeal must also fail.\",\"4\":\"11 It is well established that s 65(1) does not require the decision-maker to reach a decision to refuse to grant a visa only if a particular matter is established. Rather, what is required is a refusal of an application if the decision-maker is not affirmatively satisfied that the criteria for the visa in question have been satisfied; see for example Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v VSAF of 2003 [2005] FCAFC 73.\",\"5\":\"14 Firstly, the natural justice hearing rule did not apply to the application for review because it was filed after the commencement of the operation of s 422B of the Migration Act ; see decision of the Full Court in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Lat [2006] FCAFC 61 ; (2006) 151 FCR 214 at [60] to [67].
