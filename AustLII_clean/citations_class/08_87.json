The cross-claimant, of course, will not have to establish that the cross-respondent's conduct was the only cause. The question will be whether the contravention was a cause of the cross-claimant's loss. However, the plea as it presently stands allows the cross-respondent to say that the issue whether the cross-respondent's conduct was \\\"a cause\\\" has been raised and, in those circumstances, documents which might be adverse to the cross-claimant's case should be discovered.\\n\\n17 For those reasons, I made the order to which I have already referred.\\n\\n I certify that the preceding seventeen (17) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Lander. \\n\\n Associate:\\nDated: 19 February 2008\\n\\n Counsel for the Applicant\\/Cross-Respondent: Mr B Caine SC with Mr G Tye \\n \\n Solicitor for the Applicant\\/Cross-Respondent: Johnson Winter & Slattery \\n \\n Counsel for the Respondent\\/Cross-Claimant: Mr R Whitington QC with Mr M Evans and Mr C Beames \\n \\n Solicitor for the Respondent\\/Cross-Claimant: Norman Waterhouse \\n \\n Date of Hearing: 20 December 2007 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 19 February 2008 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2008\\/87.html\"}}"
