The Corporations Act provides that disputes about the existence of debts demanded in a statutory demand are to be resolved through the process of applying to set aside the statutory demand ( Chief Commissioner of Stamp Duties v Paliflex Pty Ltd [1999] NSWSC 15 ; (1999) 17 ACLC 467 at [38] ).\",\"1\":\"31 The exercise of the discretion under s 459S(1) does not lead to the setting aside of the statutory demand, and therefore does not remove the presumption of insolvency which arises under s 459C(2)(a). If the Court grants leave, its task is to deal with the proceedings for winding up, rather than cutting away the demand which is their substratum. The overall question of solvency is the critical issue (see, for example, D.A.G. International Pty Ltd v D.A.G. International Group Pty Ltd [2005] NSWSC 1036 at [5] per Brereton J).\\n\\n32 In my opinion, the grounds sought to be relied upon by the respondent are those which could have been relied on in application to set aside the statutory demand. As such, for these arguments to be raised the Court must be satisfied that they are material to the present solvency of the defendant company. For the reasons set out in [28] and [35], it has not been demonstrated by the defendant that these grounds are relevant to the solvency of the company.\\n\\n33 Leave to raise the grounds listed above is refused.\",\"2\":\"30 The scheme of Part 5.4 of the Corporations Act is to enable quick resolution of the issue of solvency and the determination of whether the company should be wound up, without the interposition of disputes about debts unless they are raised promptly ( David Grant & Co Pty Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation [1995] HCA 43 ; (1995) 184 CLR 265 at 270). The Corporations Act provides that disputes about the existence of debts demanded in a statutory demand are to be resolved through the process of applying to set aside the statutory demand ( Chief Commissioner of Stamp Duties v Paliflex Pty Ltd [1999] NSWSC 15 ; (1999) 17 ACLC 467 at [38] ).\",\"3\":\"20 The formalities of serving a statutory notice of demand are set out in s 109X of the Corporations Act . Service by post to the registered office shown on the records maintained by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission is effective service under s 109X(1)(a) (see for example FP Leonard Advertising v KD Travel Service Pty Ltd (1993) 11 ACLC 1,203.)\\n\\n21 Section 29(1) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) is applicable to the service of statutory demands due to s 5C of the Corporations Act . Section 29(1) deems postal service under s 109X(1)(a) to have been \\\"effected at the time at which the letter would be delivered in the ordinary course of post\\\", after it has been sent in a properly addressed, prepaid and posted letter. As a result, a statutory demand is validly served if posted to the registered office of the company as at the date of posting, even though service is deemed not to be effected until a time after posting, namely when the letter would be delivered in the ordinary course of post.\\n\\n22 By virtue of s 160 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) the statutory demand in the present case is presumed to have been served on Monday 17 July 2006, being the fourth working day after posting on Tuesday 11 July 2006. The defendant could have applied to set aside the demand in the period ending on Monday 7 August 2006. This was not done.\\n\\n23 Further, no evidence has been submitted to warrant the presumption provided for in s 160 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) being called into doubt.\\n\\n24 In my opinion there was proper and effective service of the statutory demand.\",\"4\":\"27 The defendant was unable to suggest any authority to the effect that, where the Commissioner founds a statutory demand on an assessment and there is a later assessment, the statutory demand is thereby invalidated. The defendant sought to rely on comments of Finkelstein J in NT Resorts Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1998) 153 ALR 359. These do not suggest any support for the propositions argued. His Honour said, at 367:\\n \\n It may be open to argument that where the only debt that is specified in a statutory demand is a debt that is not due and payable then the demand is not a statutory demand at all. It is true that a statutory demand is defined by s 9 to include a demand that purports to be a demand. That is, a demand that professes or claims to be a statutory demand will be a statutory demand for the purposes of the Corporations Law: see Kalamunda [ Meat Wholesalers Pty Ltd v Reg Russell & Sons Pty Ltd (1994) 51 FCR 446 at] 452. Nevertheless, there may be a case where a document that professes to be a statutory demand contains such a serious deficiency that it is impossible to treat the document as a statutory demand no matter what it professes to be: Topfelt [ Pty Ltd v State Bank of New South Wales Ltd (1993) 47 FCR 226 at] 238; Kalamunda at FCR 452. In this case it is not necessary to decide whether the demand is a statutory demand because it has not been established that the debts were not due and payable when the demand was served.\\n\\n28 Setting aside the misplaced conception of \\\"justiciability\\\", the fact is that, at the time of service of the statutory demand, there were debts lawfully payable by the defendant to the plaintiff, as alleged in that demand. By independent operation of different statutory provisions there are now lawfully payable debts which the defendant cannot duly pay so as to compel a conclusion of insolvency. At no relevant time has the defendant ever been free of debt to the plaintiff at a level sufficient to enable resort by the plaintiff to the insolvency provisions of the Corporations Act . The statutory demand did not contain \\\"such a serious deficiency that it is impossible to treat the document as a statutory demand\\\" for the same reason as that given by Finkelstein J: it has not been shown that the debts in question \\\"were not due and payable when the demand was served \\\" (emphasis added).\\n\\n29 With respect to grounds 4, 5 and 6 above, the defendant requires leave to raise these issues by virtue of s 459S of the Corporations Act . Leave is not to be granted unless the Court is satisfied that the grounds are material to the solvency of the company. The leave which may be granted under s 459S(1) is not leave to apply to set aside the statutory demand, but rather leave to oppose the application on a particular ground. If the ground of opposition is one which the company could have relied upon, but did not, in an application to set aside the demand, leave is required.\",\"5\":\"37 The Court has a discretion under s 467 not to wind up a company \\\"even if a ground has been proved on which the Court may order the company to be wound up\\\". For example, it may, in appropriate circumstances, be better for creditors as a whole to allow the company to trade on rather than have the company wound up. The Court has a duty when considering whether to make a winding up order to have regard not only to the interests of the applicant creditor, but to the interests of all creditors: Re Presha Engineering (Aust) Pty Ltd (1983) 1 ACLC 675 at 677.\\n\\n38 No evidence was put forward regarding the position of unsecured creditors other than the plaintiff. The National Australia Bank is a secured creditor. In the absence of such evidence, it cannot be said that it is against the interest of any creditors that the defendant be wound up in insolvency.\\n\\n39 There was a plea of hardship as to Ms Freeman's personal position. That the company might be wound up is a sad affair for her and she has had some unfortunate and affecting distractions, not of her making. Nevertheless, over a period of years she has been the controller of the company and has permitted it to slip into its insolvency. There is no proven prospect that that state can tolerably quickly be cured.\"}}"
