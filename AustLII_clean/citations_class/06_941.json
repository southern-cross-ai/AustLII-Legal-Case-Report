Questioning may, however, be directed to establishing the probability of the factual state of affairs, covered by the relevant subparagraph, contended for by the party conducting the questioning or the improbability of the witness's evidence on those subjects (per Heydon JA in R v Le [2002] NSWCCA 186 ; (2002) 54 NSWLR 474 at [55] - [67] ).\",\"1\":\"9 In the case of s 38(1)(a) , that about which the questioning may so proceed is 'evidence given by the witness that is unfavourable to the party' who called the witness. In R v Souleyman (1996) 40 NSWLR 712 at 715 Smart J held that, where the evidence of a witness did not, in significant respects, come up to a prior statement, his evidence was unfavourable. I must say that I have some difficulty with the proposition that one can characterise evidence given as unfavourable if, to do so, one has to go beyond the pleadings and the evidence itself. I do not think that 'unfavourable' should be construed, as suggested by Smart J, as simply 'not favourable'.

As I see it, for evidence to be characterised as 'unfavourable' it would have to detract from the case of the party calling the witness. I would prefer the approach taken by Hodgson JA with which Meagher JA agreed, in Klewer v Walton [2003] NSWCA 308 at [20] (and [30]) where his Honour expressed the view that evidence which was simply 'neutral' did not come within the word 'unfavourable' as used in s 38(1)(a). In Adam v The Queen [2001] HCA 57 ; (2001) 207 CLR 96 at [27] Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Kirby and Hayne JJ seem to me to be suggesting that for evidence to be characterised as unfavourable, it must have an unhelpful quality about it, as opposed to a neutral quality.\",\"2\":\"9 In the case of s 38(1)(a) , that about which the questioning may so proceed is 'evidence given by the witness that is unfavourable to the party' who called the witness.
