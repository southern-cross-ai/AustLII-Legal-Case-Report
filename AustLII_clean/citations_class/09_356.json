Clause 850.211 was said to be invalid because it was not authorised by s 504(1) of the Act or any other lawful authority, or because in its terms it sought to limit the operation of s 48 of the Act, or because its promulgation was an unreasonable exercise of any regulation-making power, or for any one or more of these reasons.\\n\\nIn Minister for Primary Industries and Energy v Austral Fisheries Pty Ltd , a management plan under s 7B of the Fisheries Act 1952 (Cth) was challenged on the ground that it was a form of delegated legislation which was capricious and irrational.

Dixon J (as he then was) said (at 155) in a passage quoted many times since: \\n \\\"To determine whether a by-law is an exercise of a power, it is not always enough to ascertain the subject matter of the power and consider whether the by-law appears on its face to relate to that subject. The true nature and purpose of the power must be determined, and it must often be necessary to examine the operation of the by-law in the local circumstances to which it is intended to apply. Notwithstanding that ex facie there seemed a sufficient connection between the subject of the power and that of the by-law, the true character of the by-law may then appear to be such that it could not reasonably have been adopted as a means of attaining the ends of the power. In such a case the by-law will be invalid, not because it is inexpedient or misguided, but because it is not a real exercise of the power. (Compare Widgee Shire Council v. Bonney .)\\\" \\n\\n(Citation omitted.)\\n \\nA little later in his reasons, Dixon J referred (at 156) to the question of whether a restraint embodied in the by-law could be reasonably adopted for the purpose set out in the empowering provision.\"}}"
