"{\"id\":{\"0\":\"c0\"},\"class\":{\"0\":\"cited\"},\"tocase\":{\"0\":\"Fernando v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2000] FCA 324 ; (2000) 97 FCR 407\"},\"text\":{\"0\":\"6 The learned Federal Magistrate, at paras 17 through to and including 22 of the reasons for judgment, canvasses the relevant statutory provisions as they impact on the circumstances of this case. The Magistrate noted correctly, with respect, that the effect of this Court's decision in the Fernando v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2000] FCA 324 ; (2000) 97 FCR 407 is that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to enlarge the time within which an application for review can be made.\\n\\n7 So much would seem inevitably to follow from the absence of any conferral of such power by the Migration Act 1958 . The Tribunal is a statutory tribunal and possesses no greater jurisdiction than that which Parliament has chosen to confer upon it. Section 412 of the Migration Act 1958 lays down a period within which an application to the Tribunal can be brought. If an application is brought outside that period, then the Tribunal has no ability to extend time, whatever may be the merits either in law or in fact, of the challenge that is sought to be made to the decision of the Minister or his delegate.\\n\\n8 As was, with respect, correctly highlighted in the submissions made before me on behalf of the Minister, that does not mean that the decision of the Minister or his delegate is completely immune from challenge. The High Court has jurisdiction under s 75(v) of the Constitution to grant a constitutional writ in respect of any legal error made by the Minister or his delegate. What is undoubtedly lost, though, by a failure to institute a proceeding within the time prescribed by s 412 of the Migration Act 1958 , is an ability to have the decision of the Minister or his delegate, in respect of the protection visa application, reviewed on the factual merits.\"}}"
