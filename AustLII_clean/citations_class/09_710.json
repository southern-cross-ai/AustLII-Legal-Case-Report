The terms and size of the letter were to be in accordance with a document annexed to the draft consent orders. The letter advises the addressee of the results of this proceeding, including the pecuniary penalties imposed, and of the fact that Skins may only recommend a retail price, and is not allowed to specify to retailers a minimum price below which goods or services are not to be resold or advertised for sale. Skins consented to such an order. I considered that it was appropriate to make such an order (see s 86C(2); Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Hobie Cat Australasia Pty Ltd [2008] ATPR 42-225).\\n\\nThe Commission proposed that Skins pay to the Commonwealth of Australia a pecuniary penalty of $120,000 and that Mr Warhurst pay to the Commonwealth of Australia a pecuniary penalty of $14,000.\",\"3\":\"The principal object of the penalties imposed by s 76 of the Act is deterrence, and, in particular, general deterrence: Trade Practices Commission v CSR at 52,152 per French J; NW Frozen Foods at 292 per Burchett and Kiefel JJ ; Dataline at 527-528 [60], [62]; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v McMahon Services Pty Ltd [2004] ATPR 42-031 per Selway J.

The second representation was that Skins did not provide Skins products to sports stars, or their representatives, clubs, teams or governing bodies, unless the Skins products were paid for with money. The parties referred to this representation as the \\\"always paid for\\\" representation and again it is convenient for me to do likewise.

At the same time, the Court can place weight on the pecuniary penalties proposed by the parties. The relevant principle and the reason for it were stated by the Full Court of this Court in the following passage in the reasons for judgment of Burchett and Kiefel JJ in NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [1996] FCA 1134 ; (1996) 71 FCR 285 (\\\" NW Frozen Foods \\\") at 290-291: \\n\\\"The Act places on the shoulders of the Court the responsibility to determine the 'appropriate' penalty in each particular case, having regard to 'all relevant matters' including the matters specified in the section. But effects upon the functioning of markets, and other economic effects, will generally be among the most significant matters to be considered as relevant, so that the Court is likely to be assisted greatly by views put forward by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, or by economists called on behalf of the parties. Since the decision in Trade Practices Commission v Allied Mills Industries Pty Ltd [(1981) [1981] FCA 142 ; 60 FLR 38 ; 37 ALR 256] , it has been accepted that both the facts, and also views about their effect, may be presented to the Court in agreed statements, together with joint submissions by both the Commission and a respondent as to the appropriate level of penalty. Because the fixing of the quantum of a penalty cannot be an exact science, the Court, in such a case, does not ask whether it would without the aid of the parties have arrived at the precise figure they have proposed, but rather whether their proposal can be accepted as fixing an appropriate amount. \\n \\n \\nThere is an important public policy involved. When corporations acknowledge contraventions, very lengthy and complex litigation is frequently avoided, freeing the courts to deal with other matters, and investigating officers of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to turn to other areas of the economy that await their attention. At the same time, a negotiated resolution in the instant case may be expected to include measures designed to promote, for the future, vigorous competition in the particular market concerned. These beneficial consequences would be jeopardised if corporations were to conclude that proper settlements were clouded by unpredictable risks. A proper figure is one within the permissible range in all the circumstances. The Court will not depart from an agreed figure merely because it might otherwise have been disposed to select some other figure, or except in a clear case.\\\"\\n\\nSection 76(1) of the Act requires the Court to consider all relevant matters in determining the appropriate pecuniary penalty, including the nature and extent of the contravening conduct, the amount of loss and damage caused by the contravening conduct, the circumstances in which the contravening conduct took place and whether the contravener had previously been found by the Court to have engaged in similar conduct.\\n\\nIn NW Frozen Foods , Burchett and Kiefel JJ referred (at 292) to these matters as \\\"elaborations of the statutory requirement to consider 'the circumstances in which the act or omission took place'\\\".\\n\\nIn addition to the above matters, the trial judge (Heerey J; see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd [1996] ATPR 41-515) considered (at 42,444-42,445) the financial position of the respondents and the deterrent effect of the proposed penalty.\\n\\nIt will be seen that, in the passage quoted from NW Frozen Foods and set out in [64] above, Burchett and Kiefel JJ emphasised the importance of the effects of the conduct on the functioning of the market, and other economic effects.\",\"8\":\"The Court was asked to make declarations that Skins contravened s 48 of the Act by an act of inducement in July 2005, an act of attempting to induce in September 2005 and a second act of attempting to induce in May 2006. The Court was also asked to make a declaration that on each occasion Mr Warhurst was, directly or indirectly, knowingly concerned in, or party to, the contravention. Clearly there was power to make the declarations and, having regard to the agreed facts and submissions, I considered that it was appropriate to make the declarations. The declarations I made sufficiently described the conduct which contravened s 48 (cf Rural Press Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2003] HCA 75 ; (2003) 216 CLR 53 at 91 [89] - [90] per Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ).\\n\\nThe Court was also asked to accept an undertaking by Skins in the following terms: \\n\\\"Skins undertakes to the Court that Skins shall not, by itself, its servants, agents or otherwise howsoever, for a period of 3 years from the date of this undertaking, induce or attempt to induce, any person or corporation not to sell or advertise Skins products supplied to it by Skins for sale at a price less than a price specified by Skins.\\\"\",\"9\":\"In Trade Practices Commission v CSR Ltd [1991] ATPR 41-076 (\\\" Trade Practices Commission v CSR \\\") at 52,152-52,153, French J identified relevant factors additional to those in the section and they are the following: \\n(1) the size of the contravening company;\\n \\n(2) the degree of power it has, as evidenced by its market share and ease of entry into the market;\\n \\n(3) the deliberateness of the contravention and the period over which it extended;\\n \\n(4) whether the contravention arose out of the conduct of senior management or at a lower level;\\n \\n(5) whether the company has a corporate culture conducive to compliance with the Act, as evidenced by educational programs and disciplinary or other corrective measures in response to an acknowledged contravention; and\\n \\n(6) whether the company has shown a disposition to cooperate with the authorities responsible for the enforcement of the Act in relation to the contravention.\\n\\nThe principal object of the penalties imposed by s 76 of the Act is deterrence, and, in particular, general deterrence: Trade Practices Commission v CSR at 52,152 per French J; NW Frozen Foods at 292 per Burchett and Kiefel JJ ; Dataline at 527-528 [60], [62]; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v McMahon Services Pty Ltd [2004] ATPR 42-031 per Selway J.
