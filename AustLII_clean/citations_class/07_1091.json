Ordinarily then, as was the case here, the tribunal will begin its interview of an applicant who has accepted the tribunal's invitation to appear, knowing that it is not persuaded by the material already before it to decide the review in the applicant's favour. That lack of persuasion may be based on particular questions the tribunal has about specific aspects of the material already before it; it may be based on nothing more particular than a general unease about the veracity of what is revealed in that material. But unless the tribunal tells the applicant something different, the applicant would be entitled to assume that the reasons given by the delegate for refusing to grant the application will identify the issues that arise in relation to that decision.\\n\\n21 The appellant was put on notice of the issues for determination at the Tribunal hearing as demonstrated, inter alia, by the following passages from the Tribunal's decision:\\n \\n I told him that I understood that it was easy to get official looking documents in China which were not genuine so that I would have regard to that when I was considering whether to accept that these documents were what they were purported to be.\\n\\n22 The Tribunal's decision also reveals that the appellant did not experience difficulties in understanding the interpreter at the Tribunal hearing and it specifically noted that the appellant:\\n \\n ... gave oral evidence with the assistance of a suitably accredited interpreter. He said that he had no difficulty understanding the interpreter and no objection to using her services during the hearing. \\n\\nLater, referring to the appellant's claim that his assistant in running the underground church was arrested, the Tribunal said:\\n \\n I told him that I was finding his evidence about her role very vague and asked him again what precisely she did when she took over the management of the orders for the paper. He responded that she was also a leader. He added nothing more.\",\"11\":\"13 In his written submissions, the appellant referred to the decision of the Full Court of this Court in SZCOQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCAFC 9 in support of his contention that the Tribunal had disregarded the summons and verdict documents that he had provided to the Tribunal, and that the Tribunal had not provided the appellant with an opportunity to comment on issues arising from the documentary evidence he had provided, in breach of s 424A(1) of the Act.\\n\\n14 Turner FM dismissed the appellant's claim that the Tribunal had breached s 424A(1) of the Act for two reasons. Firstly, the Tribunal had relied on its own subjective appraisals of the claims and evidence advanced by the appellant and this did not constitute ' information' within the meaning of the Act. Secondly the independent country information relied upon by the Tribunal in its finding that the supporting documents provided by the appellant were not a reliable source of evidence, fell within the exception to s 424A(1) in s 424A(3)(b) of the Act.\\n\\n15 It is clear from the decision of the Tribunal that it had relied on its subjective appraisal of the evidence given by the appellant in its finding that the appellant's claims were not credible. The Tribunal considered the appellant's evidence to be vague, lacking in detail and cogency and that his claims were implausible. It concluded that the appellant was not being truthful with respect to his claims.\"}}"
