Parties should be encouraged to engage in sensible attempts to resolve disputes having regard to all the circumstances of the case at the time at which resolution is proposed. The purpose of an order for costs is not solely to compensate one party at the expense of the other: Oshlack 193 CLR at 89 [43]. Where there is no delinquency or misconduct on the part of the party seeking to discontinue in a situation such as the present, and there has been no determination of the proceedings on the merits, it is not usually appropriate for the Court to engage in predicting the outcome or assigning responsibility for the conduct of the proceedings in a way which attributes blameworthiness, unless there is a solid foundation for doing so.\",\"4\":\"21 So, in Re Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs; Ex parte Lai Qin (1997) 186 CLR 662 at 624-625, McHugh J commented on the difficulties inherent in a court seeking to allocate costs in circumstances such as the present. As he pointed out, when there has been no hearing on the merits, a court is necessarily deprived of the factor that usually determines whether or how it should make a costs order.\\n\\n22 In the circumstances which I have briefly described it is also conceivable that Mrs Clark may have had claims under each policy, depending on the precise way in which the facts came out, particularly, what advice or other services may or may not have been given or performed by Adept in accordance with its professional obligations to her. On the pleadings and material before me, there was a sufficient basis for Mrs Clark to bring these proceedings and pursue them to judgment against both the respondents which she chose to sue, even if, properly advised, she may have been better advised to have sued Suncorp, either alone or with ING and Adept as additional respondents.\\n\\n23 Mrs Clark suffered the trauma of breast cancer. That trauma was one risk in respect of which she had contracted to have the protection of insurance cover while bringing up a young family. It is not something that can be put to one side as an irrelevant consideration in determining the reasonableness of her course of action. If a person, in the position of Mrs Clark, has to deal with a life threatening illness or condition, such as cancer, she cannot be expected to take immediately every logical, rational or commercial decision which a large corporation with adequate resources and insurance might. Such a decision is particularly difficult for a person in her position, where as an individual, she would be required to take on the burden of litigation against well-resourced insurance companies and insurance brokers, who are entitled to resist the claims made against them.\",\"5\":\"20 In Smith v Airservices Australia [2005] FCA 997 ; (2005) 146 FCR 37 at 47-50 [36] - [49] Stone J examined a number of cases in which the principles had been explored.
