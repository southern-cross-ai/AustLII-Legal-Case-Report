The many provisions referred to in argument are not free from the ' apparent inconsistencies ', if not ' illogicality ', that often characterise collective agreements negotiated between employers and employees' organisations: cf City of Wanneroo v Australian Municipal, Administrative, Clerical and Services Union (2006) 153 IR 426, at 440 [57], per French J. The difficulties of construction are compounded by the fact that the AMOU Agreement does not specifically (let alone unambiguously) address whether or not SFC needs the prior agreement of AMOU to introduce crew based rosters.\\n\\n60 Of course there is nothing unusual in an agreement, even one drafted with the benefit of considered legal advice, not specifically addressing an issue that turns out to be critical to the resolution of a dispute between the parties to the agreement. In this case, however, the omission of any explicit reference to SFC's ability (or inability) to introduce unilaterally crew based rosters is surprising. After all, the AMOU Agreement 2004 extolled the virtues of ' Vessel Teams ' (an expression similar in meaning to ' crew based rosters ') (cl 25.2). Moreover, I infer that SFC has been well aware for a considerable period of the safety benefits it says will flow from crew based rosters. Yet the AMOU Agreement apparently leaves the issue to be determined on the basis of inferences to be drawn from provisions not specifically concerned with the introduction of crew based rosters.\\n\\n61 In order to evaluate the competing arguments it is necessary to consider the terms of the AMOU Agreement in the light of the surrounding circumstances and in the context of the Agreement as a whole. There are a number of matters that require careful consideration.\\n\\n62 First , there is no dispute that under the AMOU Agreement 2004, SFC could have unilaterally introduced a crew based roster system in place of the system it had inherited. As I have noted, the virtues of ' Vessel Teams ' were expressly identified in cl 25.2 of the AMOU Agreement 2004, which also recorded that ' [SFC] and Officers [were] committed to working towards having self-managed work groups '. Apart from a notice provision, the only apparent qualifications to SFC's power as an employer unilaterally to introduce crew based rosters were the requirements that the changes:\\n \\n\\u2022 be for ' good and sufficient reason ' (cl 44.1); and\\n \\n \\n \\u2022 not be inconsistent with any other provisions of the AMOU Agreement 2004 (none of which appear to have imposed restrictions on the introduction of crew based rosters as such).\\n\\n63 Secondly , despite apparently having the power to introduce crew based rosters during the currency of the AMOU Agreement 2004, SFC did not do so. The reasons for SFC's unwillingness or inability to introduce the rosters were not revealed by the evidence.\",\"2\":\"52 As this passage implies, the language used in a collective agreement must be understood in context. The context includes the entire document of which the relevant provisions form part but it extends to the industrial context which gave rise to the agreement: Amcor v CFMEU, at 246 [2], per Gleeson CJ and McHugh J; Short v F W Hercus Pty Ltd [1993] FCA 51 ; (1993) 40 FCR 511 , at 518, per Burchett J (with whom Drummond J agreed). The words of the award or agreement cannot be interpreted in a vacuum divorced from industrial realities. Nonetheless, the words should make sense according to the conventions of the English language: City of Wanneroo v Holmes (1989) 30 IR 362, at 378-379, 380, per French J.\",\"3\":\"51 There was no dispute as to the principles that apply to the construction of a collective agreement such as the AMOU Agreement.

AMOU is an organisation registered under the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) (' WR Act ') and has corporate status conferred by the WR Act.\\n\\n4 The second-named second respondent (' SUA ') represents the General Purpose Hands (' GPHs ') employed by SFC. The SUA is an organisation registered under the Industrial Relations Act 1996 (NSW) (' NSW Act ') and is not registered under the WR Act.

Before that application could be heard by the AIRC, I granted AMOU and SUA what is commonly known as an anti-suit injunction. This restrained SFC, pending the determination of proceedings in this Court, from taking further action in the AIRC to obtain orders pursuant to s 496 of the WR Act : Sydney Ferries Corporation v Australian Maritime Officers Union [2008] FCA 817. However, I set an early date of 13 June 2008 for the hearing of SFC's claims for final relief in this Court.\\n\\n17 SFC subsequently filed an amended application in this Court which eliminated its claims for injunctions and penalties against the respondents. The amended application confined SFC's claim to declaratory relief in relation to the proper construction of the three Enterprise Agreements.\\n\\n18 At the commencement of the hearing on 13 June 2008 the parties handed up consent short minutes of order resolving the proceedings between SFC and SUA and between SFC and AIMPE. After being satisfied that I had power to do so, I duly made declarations in accordance with the short minutes of order.\"}}"
