"{\"id\":{\"0\":\"c0\"},\"class\":{\"0\":\"affirmed\"},\"tocase\":{\"0\":\"SZNAL v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FMCA 673\"},\"text\":{\"0\":\"The appellant is a citizen of China who arrived in Australia on 3 April 2008. She lodged an application for protection visa, which was refused by a delegate of the Minister. On an application for review of that decision, the Refugee Review Tribunal affirmed the decision of the delegate. The Tribunal was not satisfied the applicant's conduct in Australia satisfied s 91R(3)(b) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act'). On an application for review to the Federal Magistrates Court, Raphael FM dismissed the application ( SZNAL v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FMCA 673).\\n\\nIn her notice of appeal the appellant raises a single ground, which, as particularised, may raise certain sub-grounds. The ground in the notice of appeal is that the Federal Magistrate failed to consider the applicant's claim that the RRT decision was affected by jurisdictional error in that it incorrectly applied s 91R(3) of the Act. The particulars are: \\\"According to s 91R(3) , the Tribunal must disregard the applicant's conduct in Australia.\\\" ('Ground 1') \\\"The Tribunal failed to invite the applicant to establish the purpose for her Falun Gong practice in Australia.\\\" ('Ground 2')\\n\\n\\\"The applicant claims that she did not practise Falun Gong for the purpose of her current visa applicant.\\\" ('Ground 3') Before the Tribunal the appellant claimed that she became a practitioner of Falun Gong in 1998 but that in 1999 she ceased practising Falun Gong when Falun Gong was banned. The appellant did not claim to have left China because she was a Falun Gong practitioner who was unable to practise Falun Gong. Rather, her claim seems to have been that she had a well-founded fear of persecution due to her imputed political opinion as a person who opposed the government's treatment of Falun Gong practitioners.\"}}"
