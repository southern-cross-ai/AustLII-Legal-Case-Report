In that case, the court held that the applicant was entitled to assume the issues considered dispositive by the delegate to be issues which arose in relation to the decision under review. The High Court also held that if the Tribunal were inclined to reach its decision by reference to an issue other than those considered to be dispositive by the delegate, a failure to notify the applicant would be a denial of procedural fairness and a contravention of section 425(1).\\n\\nIn my opinion, that decision is of no assistance to the appellant in this case, because here the position is the opposite to that which occurred in SZBEL , because the Tribunal considered the issues to be narrower than those which were considered to be dispositive by the delegate.\\n\\nThe appellant appeared in person this morning.

However, there is authority in the decision of Flick J in SZKOB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1949 at [12] [14] that the Tribunal was not obliged to provide the tape recording.\\n\\nIt follows, in my view, that the appeal must be dismissed with costs. \\n \\n I certify that the preceding thirty-one (31) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Jacobson. \\n \\n Associate:\\n \\n \\nDated: 12 February 2009\\n \\n The Appellant was self-represented. \\n \\n \\n Counsel for the First Respondent: Tim Reilly \\n \\n Solicitor for the First Respondent: Sparke Helmore \\n Date of Hearing: 12 February 2009 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 12 February 2009 \\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2009\\/99.html\",\"9\":\"The question of whether the Tribunal considered the information to be a reason for affirming the decision must be a question of fact. As Siopis J observed in SZMFZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1890 at [36] : \\n [T]he assessment of whether the information enlivened the obligation on the Tribunal under s 424A(1) is made by reference to the time at which the Tribunal becomes aware of the information. Accordingly, and significantly, in light of the submission made by the first respondent, the assessment is not dependent upon the use that the Tribunal subsequently made of the information, although, in my view, that may be a relevant consideration in drawing inferences as to the proper characterisation of the information.\\n\\nThat is to say, in a proper case, the Court, in making its assessment, may draw inferences from the Tribunal's reasons as to whether the Tribunal considered the information to be a reason for affirming the decision. In the present case, not only was there no mention of the information at the Tribunal hearing, it was not mentioned in the Tribunal's reasons or in any document generated by the Tribunal during the review process. The only inference therefore available was that the Tribunal did not consider the information to be relevant. It follows, in my opinion, that Driver FM was correct in the conclusion that he reached.\\n\\nThe decision of Heerey J in MZXBQ is distinguishable, because it appears, from [6] and [12] of his Honour's reasons, that the information in question was referred to in the course of the Tribunal hearing, even though there was no reference to it in the section 424A letter or the Tribunal's reasons. Jagot J followed MZXBQ in SZJZB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2008) 105 ALD 226 , so too did Siopis J in SZMFZ , but both of those cases are distinguishable from the present matter upon the basis that the information in question was considered in those cases to be relevant by the Tribunal, either explicitly or by inference from the review process.\",\"10\":\"However, his Honour referred to the decision of the Full Court in VUAX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 158 , in which it was said that, in cases such as this, leave is more readily granted where the point has merit and there is no prejudice. It seems to me that, without the need to address in any detail the principles referred to by Lander J, it is sufficient to dispose of the further grounds upon the basis that they do not have sufficient merit.\\n\\nGround 2 states that the Refugee Review Tribunal was affected by a reasonable apprehension of bias. This has not been demonstrated.\\n\\nGround 3 expresses disagreement with the Tribunal's conclusion at [111] of its reasons. This is an impermissible claim for merits review.\"}}"
