They amounted to $1,380,000. This was not a case which, had the applicant's principal submissions been accepted, it was likely that the best that could be hoped for by way of damages would have been less than $100,000. Moreover, the issues were complex as evidenced by the engagement, on both sides, of senior counsel and the length of the submissions made on behalf of both parties: cf Tu v Pakway Australia Pty Ltd (2006) 227 ALR 287 at 293. These considerations warrant, in my view, a departure from the general rule.\\n\\n13 There should, therefore, be an order that costs not be reduced pursuant to O 62 r 36A(1) of the Rules. Save for the addition of this order and the deletion of the words \\\"reduced by one third\\\" in the first of the two orders proposed by the respondent the orders of the Court should be in accordance with those proposed by the respondent.\\n \\n \\n \\n I certify that the preceding thirteen (13) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice TRACEY. \\n\\n\\n Associate:\\n\\nDated: 12 June 2007\\n\\n Counsel for the Applicant: Mr M Colbran QC & Mr I Upjohn \\n \\n Solicitor for the Applicant: Scanlan Carroll \\n \\n Counsel for the Respondent: Mr C Macaulay SC & Mr T Woodward \\n \\n Solicitor for the Respondent: Mallesons Stephen Jaques \\n \\n Date of Hearing: (Written Submissions received 23 & 28 May 2007) \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 12 June 2007 \\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2007\\/878.html\"}}"
