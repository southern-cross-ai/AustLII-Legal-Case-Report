In my opinion, in order to waive privilege a party must assert a belief which is likely to have been, or is explicitly said to have been, materially dependent upon legal advice given to that party. In that case the proof or otherwise of the belief is dependent upon the legal advice and accordingly privilege is waived. This is the position in cases where the dispute relates to a party's understanding of its legal position at a given point in time, such as Thomason , Rio Tinto, Ampolex and Fort Dodge .\",\"4\":\"17 AMP submits that the decision in Telstra v BT and other cases propounding a 'state of mind' test should not be relied upon in view of the subsequent decision of the High Court in Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1999) 201 CLR 1 which established the inconsistency test. Additionally, AMP says the 'state of mind' test only arises in circumstances where the issue of state of mind was raised by the party claiming privilege, which is not the position in the present case.\\n\\n22 AMP says that the observations in the dissenting judgment of McHugh J in Mann v Carnell at [122], which are relied upon by AACo are inconsistent with the reasons of the majority at [30] and [35] of that decision.\\n\\n23 Since these proceedings are interlocutory, common law principles with respect to legal professional privilege apply: see Mann v Carnell at 12 [27], 16-17 [41], 45 [143] and 45 [144] and DSE (Holdings) Pty Limited at 504 [11].\\n\\n24 The test for waiver of legal professional privilege at common law was enunciated by the High Court in Mann v Carnell . In that case, a majority of the Court at [28]:\\n \\n 'It is inconsistency between the conduct of the client and maintenance of the confidentiality which effects a waiver of the privilege.'\\n\\n25 The Court added at [29]:\\n \\n 'What brings about the waiver is the inconsistency, which the courts, where necessary informed by considerations of fairness, perceive, between the conduct of the client and maintenance of the confidentiality; not some overriding principle of fairness operating at large.'\\n\\n26 Prior to the decision in Mann v Carnell , the leading authority of this Court relating to waiver of legal professional privilege was Telstra Corporation v BT Australasia . In that case, Branson and Lehane JJ observed (at 166):\\n \\n 'A party who initiates an undue influence case puts in issue in the proceeding the quality of his or her consent or assent ... The quality of such consent or assent will ordinarily be affected by relevant legal advice received by the party. The principle that requires that in such circumstances the party not be entitled to maintain the confidentiality of such advice is one of fairness which goes to the integrity of the legal process. To allow a party to put in issue the quality of his or her consent or assent whilst, at the same time, withholding evidence relevant to that issue, would be to allow him or her unfairly to handicap the opposing party to the proceeding, and to compromise the ability of the court realistically to determine the issue.'\\n\\n28 The effect of Mann v Carnell upon the ratio in Telstra was considered by Allsop J in DSE (Holdings) Pty Ltd v Intertan Inc , where his Honour said (at 501-502 [4]-[5]):\\n \\n 'I have come to the view that the authorities in this Court may require me to be guided by what the majority of the Full Court said in Telstra Corporation Ltd v BT Australasia Pty Ltd (1998) 85 FCR 152, as necessarily modified by Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1999) 201 CLR 1 at 12 [27] and 13 [29] ... \\n \\n My own view is that Mann v Carnell evinces more than a modification of the approach of the majority in Telstra and amounts to a rejection of that approach and that the notion of inconsistency of conduct by the holder of the privilege and the maintenance of the confidence in question (though informed where relevant by notions of fairness) works a narrower and more confined operation for implied waiver than as expressed by the majority in Telstra .'\\n\\n29 I respectfully agree with his Honour with respect to the effect of Mann v Carnell . To the extent that Telstra suggests that fairness is the overriding consideration, it should not be followed. It is clear that following Mann v Carnell , inconsistency of conduct should be the guiding principle in determining whether legal professional privilege has been waived, although fairness remains an element for consideration in determining whether conduct is inconsistent.\\n\\n36 In respect of AACo's second submission, namely that AMP waived its privilege by communicating its legal advice to Rabo, I consider that the applicant must also fail. In Mann v Carnell , the majority observed that the reasoning of all members of the Court in Goldberg v Ng [1995] HCA 39 ; (1995) 185 CLR 83 'was inconsistent with the proposition that any voluntary disclosure to a third party necessarily waives privilege': see Mann v Carnell at 14 [30]. The majority also noted the observations of Jordan CJ in Thomason at 355, where his Honour said:\\n \\n 'The mere fact that a person on some one occasion chooses to impart to another or others advice which he has received from his solicitor indicates no intention on his part to waive his right to refuse on other occasions to disclose in evidence what that advice was, and supplies no sufficient reason for depriving him of a form of protection which the law has deemed it specially necessary to throw around communications between solicitor and client.'\\n\\n37 In view of these authorities, the disclosure of legal advice in confidence to a commercial adviser cannot, in my opinion, be considered inconsistent with the retention of privilege. In this respect, McHugh J's observations in Mann v Carnell at [120] are inconsistent with the majority reasoning.\\n\\n38 For the above reasons, the Court orders that:\\n \\n1.

In my opinion, however one approaches the question (as to which see [44] and [45]), he has so acted. The inconsistency arises from the combination of the following three facts: \\n \\n \\n \\u2022 the respondent has, by his Statement, raised as an issue in the instant proceedings his states of mind; \\n \\u2022 the respondent has, by his response to the applicant's request for particulars of his Statement, disclosed that the privileged scheduled documents had a bearing on those states of mind; and \\n \\u2022 the respondent has refused to produce those documents in answer to the first notice to produce.'\\n\\n33 The above authorities establish that the conduct of a party will be inconsistent with the maintenance of privilege if the nature and extent of legal advice has been raised, whether directly or by necessary implication, by that party as an issue in the proceedings. This will usually occur where a state of mind has been positively pleaded in circumstances where legal advice given would be specifically pertinent to the formation of that state of mind or where a party's understanding of their legal position is critical to their defence.\\n\\n35 In the present case, the belief pleaded by AMP is not intimately connected with the legal advice given to it at the time: cf Ampolex per Giles CJ Comm D at 411F. AMP's defence does not make assertions as to the content of legal advice given to it; nor does AMP's defence state that its decision to accept the tender of Nebo was based upon legal advice: cf Rio Tinto.

In respect of the privilege Jordan CJ said (at 358-9):\\n \\n 'Hence, in effect, one of the issues in the case was what advice if any the plaintiff had received from her legal advisers as to her alternative legal rights. In these circumstances, since the fact and nature of the advice is an issue in the case, I am of opinion that privilege cannot be raised to prevent the proof of the advice.'\\n\\n34 However, I cannot accept the submission of AACo that any positive defence mounted by AMP which raises its state of mind necessarily constitutes a waiver of privilege.
