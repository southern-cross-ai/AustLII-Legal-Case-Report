No controversy of fact has been raised by the respondents and the issues of law raised by the applicant's claim are clear and unarguable. The respondents have failed to depose to facts disclosing a defence on the merits. There is no affidavit which identifies a defence to the applicant's claim as a matter of law nor any facts identified by affidavit or otherwise which might give rise to a controversy of fact which if resolved in the respondents' favour would give rise to a defence to the applicant's claim ( Hocking v Bell [1945] HCA 16 ; (1945) 71 CLR 430 , per Latham CJ at 441-442, adopted by Rares J in Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2007) 236 ALR 720 ; cf., generally, Finkelstein J in Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Co. of Australia Ltd [2008] FCAFC 60 ; (2008) 246 ALR 465 , as to the test to be applied in exercising the discretion under s 31A).

Before judgment might be entered pursuant to s 31A of the Federal Court Act, the Court is required to be satisfied that the respondents have no reasonable prospect of successfully defending the proceeding. Even though the defence filed by the respondents need not be hopeless or bound to fail for it to have no reasonable prospect of success, it is clear in the face of the affidavit evidence of the applicant and the terms of the defence filed by the respondents, that the defence is bound to fail. The evidence clearly establishes the case made by the applicant.
