"{\"id\":{\"0\":\"c0\"},\"class\":{\"0\":\"affirmed\"},\"tocase\":{\"0\":\"SZDDZ v MIMA [2006] FMCA 1174\"},\"text\":{\"0\":\"1 This is an appeal from the Federal Magistrates Court: SZDDZ v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural Affairs [2006] FMCA 1174. The appellant, a citizen of India, applied for a protection visa which was refused. That decision was affirmed by the Refugee Review Tribunal but the Tribunal's decision was set aside by a consent order of the Full Court. On the second hearing of the review by a Tribunal differently constituted the refusal of the appellant's application was again confirmed.\\n\\n2 On the appeal to the Federal Magistrate, it appears that the grounds relied on were, first, the appellant did not have a fair hearing before the Tribunal and, secondly, that the Tribunal made a jurisdictional error when it \\\"took advantage of the situation created by the interpreter\\\" which led to the appellant putting himself in a \\\"scary situation\\\". In essence, the Magistrate found that there was no evidence to support the allegations of the appellant. I shall not repeat the full discussion of the appellant's claims by the Magistrate which are set out in his decision which is obtainable on the Internet.\"}}"
