It is for the applicant to precisely identify the question of law which founds the jurisdiction of this Court to hear the appeal: Birdseye v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2003] FCAFC 232 at [18] .\",\"2\":\"On 7 March 2006 Lee J ordered the applicant to file particulars of grounds of appeal by 28 March 2006. On that day the applicant filed a document which purports to give particulars of the grounds of appeal. On this appeal the applicant sought to adduce further evidence. The material which is sought to be adduced did not come into existence until after the respondent had made the decision complained of. Indeed, the material did not come into existence until after the AAT decision. The applicant sought to tender the material for the purpose of inviting this Court to come to a different conclusion on the facts to that arrived at by the AAT. It should not be admitted: Servos v Repatriation Commission (1995) 56 FCR 377 per Spender J at 385.\\n\\nAn examination of the notice of appeal and the particulars contained in that last mentioned document indicate that no question of law is raised on this appeal. Clearly, the grounds in paragraphs (b) and (c) are not questions of law. Nor, in my opinion, are the grounds in paragraphs (a), (d) and (e). In any event, the AAT was obliged to consider any relevant material which had been supplied to it by the respondent pursuant to the respondent's obligation under s 37 of the AAT Act. None of the information supplied was relevant. The complaint in paragraph (d) cannot be sustained. The AAT's reasons, to which I have already referred, show that the AAT did have regard to the applicant's evidence. The AAT was under no obligation to refer to each piece of evidence that the applicant had put before the AAT.\\n\\nParagraph (e) is simply not relevant. At the time the respondent made the FTL penalty remission decision, which was subject to review before the AAT, the respondent did not know whether there was any tax payable by the applicant for the years under question because the applicant had not lodged her returns. They were still not lodged, I think, at the time that the AAT made its decision.\"}}"
