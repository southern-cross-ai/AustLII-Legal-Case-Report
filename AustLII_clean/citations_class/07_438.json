"{\"id\":{\"0\":\"c0\"},\"class\":{\"0\":\"followed\"},\"tocase\":{\"0\":\"Zhang v Royal Australian Chemical Institute Inc [2005] FCAFC 99 ; [2005] 144 FCR 347\"},\"text\":{\"0\":\"5 This morning, Mr Vernier, with respect to the first complaint, has drawn my attention to a judgment of a Full Court of this Court in Zhang v Royal Australian Chemical Institute Inc [2005] FCAFC 99 ; [2005] 144 FCR 347, particularly, at [25] and [26] in the judgment of Lander J, with whom Spender and Kenny JJ agreed. That decision seems to me to be directly on point and adds further support for what, in any event in this case, appears clearly enough from the statutory provisions, namely that Mr Sapula has no cause of action arising under s 659 of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth).\\n\\n6 Neither does he have any cause of action arising under s 661 of that Act.\\n\\n7 I have been asked by the respondent to give summary judgment for it in the proceedings. I am satisfied, in accordance with s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), that the applicant has no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding and that it is an appropriate case for the matter to be dismissed at this stage. Accordingly, I order that the proceedings be dismissed.\"}}"
