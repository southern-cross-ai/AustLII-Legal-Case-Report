In Clothing Trades Award 1982(1) (Derole Case) (1990) 140 IR 123, a Full Bench of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission referred to \\\"obtains\\\" at 127 and said:\\n ...the creation of the legal relationship of master and servant [between the outgoing employer's employee and the incoming employer] depends on a mutuality being arrived at between the individual and the incoming employer. Therefore, the pursuit of alternative employment by the outgoing employer cannot be expected, by reason of itself alone, to produce the new employment; there will usually...remain the opportunity for the incoming employer, and the employee, to disagree as to matters such as terms of employment, suitability of the job to the employee and vice versa so that alternative employment may not eventuate.\\n\\n13 The Full Bench went on at 127 to consider \\\"obtain\\\" in context to signify that:\\n ...the employer by purpose and effort may establish an opportunity which suits the employee and which crystallises as alternative employment of an acceptable kind. \\nLater, at 128, the Full Bench said:\\n The employer must be a strong, moving force towards the creation of the available opportunity.\\n\\n14 In the relevant AWAs of the employee applicants, the applicable sub-clause refers to the employer being \\\"able to arrange alternative employment.\\\" There is no material difference between obtaining alternative employment and being able to arrange it. If an employer who is about to make an employee redundant said to the employee, \\\"I have obtained alternative employment for you\\\" or said \\\"I have been able to arrange alternative employment for you\\\", the employee would understand the employer on each occasion to be saying that it has found another job for the employee. The employee may not choose to take up the job, but it must be one that is there for the taking if the employee chooses to take it.\"}}"
