Making allegations of fraud knowing them to be false. \\n \\n 2. Evidence of particular misconduct that causes loss of time to the court and to other parties.\\n 3. Making of allegations which ought never to have been made or the undue prolongation of a case by groundless contentions.\\n 4. The fact that proceedings were commenced or continued for some ulterior motive or unlawful disregard of known facts or clearly established law. \\n \\n5. Any prudent refusal of an offer to compromise.\\n\\n19 These principles, as articulated in Colgate-Palmolive , are well known and were recently reinforced by the Full Court of the Federal Court in InterTAN Inc v DSE (Holdings) Pty Ltd [2005] FCAFC 54 at [11] . The categories of cases I have listed are not closed. The Court clearly has wide discretion under s 43 Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) to order costs in any particular matter. In this particular case I am not persuaded that the circumstances of the case are such as to warrant a departure from the usual practice of the Court in awarding party to party costs so far as the costs of the respondent are concerned. There is no evidence before me that this case exhibits special or unusual features so as to justify the Court exercising its discretion so as to award indemnity costs. Further, notwithstanding the failure of the applicant to attend on numerous occasions there is no evidence before me that the applicant's case against the respondent was \\\"hopeless\\\" or had no chance of success, or that the applicant's case was not based on evidentiary or factual foundations.\",\"1\":\"19 These principles, as articulated in Colgate-Palmolive , are well known and were recently reinforced by the Full Court of the Federal Court in InterTAN Inc v DSE (Holdings) Pty Ltd [2005] FCAFC 54 at [11] .
