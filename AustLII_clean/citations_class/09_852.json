The question is whether this proceeding involves a \\\"matter\\\" within the meaning of those provisions.\\n\\nOwston accepts that declaratory relief is often given on the motion of a regulator, but it says that usually a declaration is only granted in conjunction with substantive relief which is in its nature either protective such as by the grant of injunctive relief or corrective advertising orders or alternatively a punishment by awarding, for example, civil penalties. It contends that a bare declaration will be made only in rare circumstances, absent other relief that gives effect to a right or obligation. It cites Gaudron J in Truth About Motorways Pty Limited v Macquarie Infrastructure Management Limited [2000] HCA 11 ; (2000) 200 CLR 591 at [52] : \\n There may be cases where a bare declaration that some legal requirement has been contravened will serve to redress some or all of the harm brought about by that contravention. Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission (109) was such a case. But a declaration cannot be made if it \\\"will produce no foreseeable consequences for the parties\\\". (110) That is not simply a matter of discretion. Rather, a declaration that produces no foreseeable consequences is so divorced from the administration of the law as not to involve a matter for the purposes of Ch III of the Constitution . And as it is not a matter for those purposes, it cannot engage the judicial power of the Commonwealth. (See Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission [1992] HCA 10 ; (1992) 175 CLR 564 at 582, per Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ).\\n\\nForster v Jododex Australia Pty Ltd [1972] HCA 61 ; (1972) 127 CLR 421 was cited by Owston in support of the proposition that the Court may not be \\\"forced to consider a hypothetical situation where its decision will produce no foreseeable consequences for the parties\\\". Jododex is not authority for such a proposition. Rather, this formulation reflects the language of the joint judgment in Ainsworth at p 582 adopting what had been said in University of New South Wales v Moorhouse [1975] HCA 26 ; (1975) 133 CLR 1 at 10 as to a hypothetical question and in Gardner v Dairy Industry Authority (NSW) (1977) 52 ALJR 180 at 188, as to \\\"foreseeable consequences\\\". It is also the formulation adopted by Gaudron J in Truth About Motorways at [52]. Gibbs J at 435 in Jododex said that the jurisdiction to make a declaration is a very wide one. Jododex is, as was also approved by the majority judgment in Ainsworth, authority, at 437, that the power of superior courts to grant declaratory relief is discretionary which \\\"it is neither possible nor desirable to fetter ... by laying down rules as to the manner of its exercise\\\".\\n\\nThe jurisdiction to grant declaratory relief is wide. In JN Taylor Holdings Ltd (in liq) v Bond (1993) 59 SASR 432 at 435-436 there is a useful collection of relevant authority to that effect. King CJ, with whom Prior and Perry JJ agreed observed: \\n Authoritative judicial statements make it clear that the jurisdiction to grant declaratory relief is very wide and that judicial pronouncements appearing to restrict the circumstances in which such relief will be granted relate to the sound exercise of the discretion rather than to jurisdiction; Ibeneweka v Egbuna [1964] 1 WLR 219 at 225; Forster v Jododex Australia Pty Ltd esp per Gibbs J at 438; Salmar Holdings Pty Ltd v Hornsby Shire Council [1971] 1 NSWLR 192 per Mason JA at 201. It is not necessary that the plaintiff have a cause of action against the defendant: Guaranty Trust Company of New York v Hannay and Co [1915] 2 KB 536. A statement by Lord Sterndale MR in Hanson v Radcliffe Urban District Council [1922] 2 Ch 490 at 507, quoted by Gibbs J in Forster v Jododex at 435, appeared to confine the otherwise unlimited character of the jurisdiction to cases involving \\\"a question of defining the rights of two parties\\\". As was pointed out, however, by Street CJ in Johnco Nominees Pty Ltd v Albury-Wodonga (NSW) Corporation [1977] 1 NSWLR 43 at 51, that statement was made \\\"at a time when the declaratory jurisdiction had not achieved the full development manifested in the last 20 or 30 years.\\\" By 1970 the Privy Council could say in Rediffusion (Hong Kong) Ltd v Attorney-General of Hong Kong [1970] AC 1136 at 1158 that to exclude the jurisdiction it must appear \\\"that the questions were purely abstract questions the answers to which were incapable of affecting any existing or future legal rights of the plaintiffs\\\" [emphasis mine]. In Johnco Nominees Pty Ltd v Albury-Wodonga (NSW) Corporation (above), Street CJ (at 53) repudiated the notion of jurisdictional cut-off points in relation to declaratory relief. Moffitt P said (at 57): \\n The proper conclusion to be drawn concerning the power to make a declaration is that the jurisdiction (in the strict sense) to grant declaratory relief in a properly constituted action is very wide, so that no particular limitation can be pointed to ... \\n\\n \\n I can find no warrant for the imposition by the courts of a self-denying restriction on their jurisdiction to grant declaratory relief. In my opinion there is no jurisdictional limit. The court's power to grant such relief is \\\"only limited by its own discretion\\\" ( Hanson v Radcliffe at 507), and the boundaries of judicial power: Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission [1992] HCA 10 ; (1992) 175 CLR 564 at 581-582.\",\"1\":\"Second, there is a real risk of the same facts being re-litigated. That is plainly oppressive to Owston. Owston should not be exposed to two (or possibly more) trials of the same issue, particularly given the nature of the relief sought in this action. As non-parties the investors are not bound by any findings in Owston's favour: Ann Street Mezzanine Pty Limited (in liq) v Beck (2009) 225 ALR 324 at [26] and [32] per Finkelstein J. Owston's primary submission is that it will not be bound in later proceedings by a finding of fact or law, other than the latter's precedential value that is made against its interests in this action. Although unable to bring proceedings which amount to a collateral attack on the result in these proceedings, Owston submits it is entitled to defend itself from attack by re-litigating issues decided against its interest. (Hon K Handley \\\" Res Judicata: General Principles and Recent Developments \\\" (1999) 18 Aust Bar Review 214 at 220 and the authority cited). That findings made in these proceedings are not binding in any later proceedings brought by any investors is consistent, it says, with the structure of the Act. It observes that ASIC can bring, but has not brought, representative proceedings under s 1325(3) of the Act provided certain condition are met. It also points to the fact that under s 1317F certain findings of breach of a civil penalty provision are binding on the defendants. The legislature has decided that only findings in civil penalty proceedings are binding, and not findings in other proceedings brought by ASIC. Owston acknowledges that these submissions \\\"may not be unquestionably right\\\".\\n\\nThird, where the relief sought in these proceedings is calculated to encourage re-litigation of the issues this will likely bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The possibility of re-litigation according to Owston is not a mere risk but rather is the very purpose of these proceedings. It is not the function of this Court, or proper exercise of a power under the Act, to promote litigation.\\n\\nFourth, in the event of the issues in these proceedings being re-litigated there is the obvious potential for inconsistent findings. That is a possibility to be avoided, not encouraged. These proceedings are calculated to promote the re-litigation of the same issues in which inconsistent findings are possible.\",\"2\":\"Gray J in ASIC v West (2008) 100 SASR 496 at [203] adopted the same approach to the grant of declaratory relief in favour of ASIC. More recently a bare declaration was granted by Finkelstein J in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v HLP Financial Planning (Aust) Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1868 ; (2007) 164 FCR 487. The Court declared that the \\\"scheme\\\" in question was an unregistered managed investment scheme in contravention of s 601ED(5) of the Act. His Honour said that the power to do so may be exercised whether or not other relief is sought and rejected the defendant's submission that a mere declaration would have no utility as the scheme had already been wound up following the winding up of the HLP companies, for the reason that: \\n ... it is appropriate to make the declaration sought by ASIC. Many people put money into the scheme. They are entitled to know that the scheme was illegal and that is one reason why the HLP group was wound up. The declaration will not enable the investors to recover their money. But at least it will inform them what they had got themselves into.\",\"3\":\"Owston submits that the s 1324B order is not consequential on the declarations sought and that in terms it can only be consequential on a finding of a breach of the Act. It says that here the order sought is relevantly disconnected from the breach with no sufficient nexus, citing ASIC v McDougall (2006) 57 ACSR 175 at [69]. It says that it is not a remedy in the true sense for the alleged wrong, but amounts, in effect, to advice from ASIC, with the Court's endorsement, to the shareholders concerned. It says that a final determination between the parties of an issue that has no practical consequence between those parties does not convert a hypothetical question into a \\\"matter\\\", otherwise all hypothetical questions would be a \\\"matter\\\" once a contradictor was found.\\n\\nAs Young J in Re McDougall: Australian Securities & Investments Commission v McDougall (2006) 57 ACSR 175 at [55] observed, the courts, since Australian Softwood Forest Pty Ltd v Attorney-General (NSW) [1981] HCA 49 ; (1981) 148 CLR 121 have recognised that the grant of declaratory relief on the application of a statutory body such as ASIC may serve important law enforcement purposes: Corporate Affairs Commission (NSW) v Transphere Pty Ltd (1988) 15 NSWLR 596 at 603; 14 ACLR 644 at 647; Australian Securities & Investments Commission v Sweeney [2001] NSWSC 114 at [30] - [31] ; Australian Securities & Investments Commission v Pegasus Leveraged Options Group Pty Ltd (2002) 41 ACSR 561-574.\",\"4\":\"As Young J in Re McDougall: Australian Securities & Investments Commission v McDougall (2006) 57 ACSR 175 at [55] observed, the courts, since Australian Softwood Forest Pty Ltd v Attorney-General (NSW) [1981] HCA 49 ; (1981) 148 CLR 121 have recognised that the grant of declaratory relief on the application of a statutory body such as ASIC may serve important law enforcement purposes: Corporate Affairs Commission (NSW) v Transphere Pty Ltd (1988) 15 NSWLR 596 at 603; 14 ACLR 644 at 647; Australian Securities & Investments Commission v Sweeney [2001] NSWSC 114 at [30] - [31] ; Australian Securities & Investments Commission v Pegasus Leveraged Options Group Pty Ltd (2002) 41 ACSR 561-574.\\n\\nDavies AJ in Australian Securities & Investments Commission v Pegasus Leveraged Options Group Pty Ltd [2002] NSWSC 310 ; (2002) 41 ACSR 561 at [38] adopted what Austin J had said in Sweeney as well as by Young J in Corporate Affairs Commission v Transphere Pty Ltd (1989) 7 ACLC 205 at 209. In particular his Honour agreed with the views expressed by their Honours that when declarations are sought by a public authority such as ASIC then the declaration should be made if it is in the public interest to do so (at [39]).\",\"5\":\"Owston submits that no final determination or resolution of the alleged contravention will take place without additional factual findings and determinations of issues of law and that accordingly, the Court is being asked to consider a hypothetical situation where its decision will produce no foreseeable consequences for the parties as to which it relies upon Forster v Jododex Australia Pty Ltd [1972] HCA 61 ; (1972) 127 CLR 421 ; Australian Institute of Private Detectives Ltd v Privacy Commissioner [2004] FCA 1440 ; (2004) 139 FCR 394.\\n\\nOwston also cites Australian Institute of Private Detectives Ltd v Privacy Commissioner [2004] FCA 1440 ; (2004) 139 FCR 394. However in that case the applicant sought declarations \\\"independently of any specific factual allegations\\\" [29] which went \\\"merely to future events or circumstances\\\" which would not quell any existing controversy between the parties to the proceedings [31] and which was, in effect, seeking an advisory opinion [32]. A Full Court of this Court has expressed doubt as to whether an application for a declaration as to the legality of proposed future conduct involves a \\\"matter\\\" within the meaning of ss 75 , 76 and 77 of the Constitution of the Commonwealth: IMF (Australia) Ltd v Sons of Gwalia Ltd (Administrator appointed) [2005] FCAFC 75 ; (2005) 143 FCR 274 per Moore and Emmett at [16], [67] and [68]; (cf IMF (Australia) Ltd v Sons of Gwalia (Administrator Appointed) (2004) 211 ALR 231 per then French J at [43]. That, however, is not this case.\\n\\nIn the present proceedings, by contrast, ASIC has made quite specific factual allegations concerning past events so that the court's decision will quell the controversy between it and Owston. Australian Institute of Private Detectives is not authority for the proposition that declarations must quell all controversies about an issue that might arise between a defendant and persons who are not parties to the litigation and who might sue that defendant about the same or similar issues.\",\"6\":\"As Young J in Re McDougall: Australian Securities & Investments Commission v McDougall (2006) 57 ACSR 175 at [55] observed, the courts, since Australian Softwood Forest Pty Ltd v Attorney-General (NSW) [1981] HCA 49 ; (1981) 148 CLR 121 have recognised that the grant of declaratory relief on the application of a statutory body such as ASIC may serve important law enforcement purposes: Corporate Affairs Commission (NSW) v Transphere Pty Ltd (1988) 15 NSWLR 596 at 603; 14 ACLR 644 at 647; Australian Securities & Investments Commission v Sweeney [2001] NSWSC 114 at [30] - [31] ; Australian Securities & Investments Commission v Pegasus Leveraged Options Group Pty Ltd (2002) 41 ACSR 561-574.\\n\\nAustin J in Australian Securities & Investments Commission v Sweeney (2001) NSWSC 114 at 30-31 said: \\n It is beyond contest that this Court has plenary jurisdiction to make a declaratory order concerning contravention of the Corporations Law, by virtue of ss 23 and 75 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW). In Australian Softwood Forests Pty Ltd v Attorney-General (NSW) [1981] HCA 49 ; (1981) 148 CLR 121 , the High Court expressly disagreed with the Court of Appeal of New South Wales, which had declined to grant a declaration with respect to contravention of the 'prescribed interests' provisions of the Companies Act 1961 (NSW). Gibbs CJ remarked that it was proper to grant a declaration in that case although it had been agreed that an injunction was not an appropriate remedy (at 125). \\n\\n \\n In Corporate Affairs Commission v Transphere Pty Ltd (1989) 7 ACLC 205 , 209, Young J dealt with the question more fully. He observed that, while a declaration will not ordinarily be made that a defendant has committed a crime, there is jurisdiction to do so in a proper case. In his Honour's view, older cases which discouraged a statutory authority from commencing proceedings for declaratory relief are no longer applicable, in view of the changed social climate, and the Court will now grant declaratory relief at the suit of the statutory authority which exists to regulate an industry, in an appropriate case: at 214. In his Honour's view, the fact that the subject matter of the declaration is of public interest is an important consideration in favour of the granting of declaratory relief, even though the order may be of only slight utility: at 213. In that case the Court declined to make a declaratory order, because (inter alia) the declaration would affect investors who were not parties to the proceedings. That consideration is not present here. The approach taken in the Federal Court is very similar: Tobacco Institute of Australia Ltd v Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations Inc [1993] FCA 83 ; (1993) 113 ALR 257. \\n\\n \\nand at 34-35:\\n \\n The present proceedings have been brought by the public regulator to enforce the corporations and securities legislation.

As Sheppard J said: \\n \\\"[a]s in [ Australian Softwood Forests Pty Ltd v Attorney-General (NSW); Ex rel Corporate Affairs Commission [1981] HCA 49 ; (1981) 148 CLR 121] , it is often useful to be able to make a declaration in a case that does not warrant the granting of injunctive relief. The making of declaratory orders in such cases without the grant of injunctive relief in litigation brought under the general law to enforce public rights is not an uncommon course.\\\" \\n\\n \\nIn the same case, Hill J said (at 110) \\n \\n [t]here can be little doubt that a declaration might be obtained by a regulatory authority that particular conduct is in breach of a statutory provision ... It has never been suggested that no power exists to grant such declaratory relief merely because the consequence of a declaration is to declare the existence of a wrong. The declaration that an offence has been committed is the concomitant of the non-existence of a right. Semantically, it may be said to be the declaration of a negative right.

It contends that a bare declaration will be made only in rare circumstances, absent other relief that gives effect to a right or obligation. It cites Gaudron J in Truth About Motorways Pty Limited v Macquarie Infrastructure Management Limited [2000] HCA 11 ; (2000) 200 CLR 591 at [52] : \\n There may be cases where a bare declaration that some legal requirement has been contravened will serve to redress some or all of the harm brought about by that contravention.

(110) That is not simply a matter of discretion.
