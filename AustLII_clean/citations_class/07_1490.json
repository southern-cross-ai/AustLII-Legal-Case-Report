Brother did not in any way project or authorise the sale or distribution of the OEM products into the Australian market. Brother later became aware that, contrary to its policy, the product was retailed in Australia by Dynamic Supplies as a Brother-branded product in counterfeit packaging which prominently displayed the Brother name and trade mark. Authorities such as Estex [1966] HCA 81 ; 116 CLR 254 and Bailey 4 NSWLR 701 lay down principles in relation to their own peculiar facts and so the observations they make are not applicable to the facts of this case.

The packaging and invoices identified the Sample Units as genuine Brother DR-200 units when, to the contrary, they were OEM products not branded with the Brother trade mark and sold exclusively to Company X.

It submits that it there is sufficient evidence of defectiveness of the units. Mr Piccinini deposed that the units were returned to Dynamic Supplies by customers, who then received a refund. Counsel for Dynamic Supplies submitted that the only commercially sensible inference is that the refund was paid because the units were defective. This evidence is supported, it is said, by inferences to be drawn from a consistent pattern according to which defective units were replaced by Brother Australia and the thoroughness of the practices by which Mr Dobrowolski of Brother Australia inspected and tested the units. Dynamic Supplies also submits that, since it is agreed that Brother Japan manufactured the products, there is no difficulty in establishing that Brother bears the liability rather than Dynamic Supplies: see Leeks v FXC Corporation [2002] FCA 72 ; (2002) 118 FCR 299 at 302.\\n\\n95 The cross-claim must fail in this case due to the lack of sufficient evidence establishing the defectiveness of the units. The assertion by Mr Piccinini that Dynamic Supplies provided refunds to its consumers is not sufficient evidence of the defectiveness of the units. There are no details of specific defects or their nature and extent. Refunds may be given for many reasons other than discovery of a fault in the product, for example, to maintain goodwill, for public relations purposes, to enhance reputation, or as a matter of general corporate policy when goods are claimed to be defective. Normally, a retailer making a claim under ss 74D and 74H will adduce some specific evidence in the form of documents, photographs or statements, as to the fault and give evidence as to how the product fails to function properly and why it has been deemed defective. In cases such as the present where the product can no longer be obtained, at least some evidence identifying the type of defect, and when and how the defect was ascertained in the particular products, should be adduced. This evidence may be in the form of, for example, test sheets, affidavits by the person who inspected and identified the defect, or documentation which identifies the defective product and its defects. The inferences which Dynamic Supplies submits should be drawn in this case are not open on the sparse evidence adduced.\\n\\n96 In light of my finding that the evidence does not establish the defectiveness of the units, it is not necessary for me to express an opinion on Brother's submission that it has not engaged in 'trade and commerce' for the purposes of TPA. Accordingly, I do not propose to deal with that question in these reasons.\\n\\n97 For these reasons, the cross-claim should be dismissed.\\n\\n98 I allow the applicants' claim that the respondent has infringed the registered trade marks, and has engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct in contravention of ss 52 and 53 of the TPA and the tort of passing off.

The dictionary definition of 'accessory' has been considered in the authorities and has been described as \\\" an additional or subordinate thing; an adjunct, an accompaniment; a minor fitting or attachment \\\": see Nokia Corporation v Truong (2006) 66 IPR 511 at 516.\\n\\n66 I accept Brother's submissions that printer drum units are apparatus for the transmission or reproduction of images, and that the categorisation of a printer drum unit as a 'consumable' does not take it outside the description of a 'part', 'accessory' or 'attachment'. The evidence of both parties' witnesses indicates that printer drum units are part of the internal working of printers, facsimiles and multi-function devices. They are called consumables because they are parts or accessories with a limited life span, which is generally shorter than the life span of the machine in which they function. Although printer drum units are not fixed permanently within the machines and are removable for replacement, the machines cannot function without them. Given this essential role of the printer drum units, it is wrong to characterise them on the basis they are not a part of or an accessory to those machines. Accordingly, the proper conclusion is that trade marks 440897, 479964 and 1000137 are registered in respect of Brother's printer drum units, such as the Brother DR-200. I also accept Brother's submission that the cardboard box in which a printer drum unit is packaged is itself a 'good' made of cardboard falling within the scope of both class 16 and the specifications of registered trade mark 479964. Indeed, there was little genuine dispute on this point.\\n\\n67 However, despite my finding that printer drum units are covered by the specifications of trade marks 440897, 479964 and 1000137 (and cardboard packaging by the specifications of trade mark 479966), in my view, Dynamic Supplies' submission that registered trade mark 1000137 was registered only after the conduct of Dynamic Supplies impugned by Brother, and therefore was not breached by that conduct, is correct. The trap purchases in this case were made in late February and early March 2004, and Brother did not register trade mark 1000137 until 30 April 2004. It is not possible, therefore, for registered trade mark 1000137 to be infringed by Dynamic Supplies' conduct in the same way the remainder of Brother's Australian trade marks have been.\\n\\n68 For these reasons, I find that both the Brother DR-200 units and Brother DR-200 packaging are goods in respect of which Brother's Australian trade marks are registered, but that trade mark 1000137 has not been infringed by the Dynamic Supplies' conduct.\\n\\n69 A respondent which uses an applicant's registered trade mark in the course of trade in relation to goods which fall within the scope of the mark's specifications will not infringe the mark if the use was with the consent of the applicant: see s 123 of the Act .\",\"11\":\"43 In R & A Bailey & Co Ltd v Boccaccio Pty Ltd (1986) 4 NSWLR 701, Young J considered the authorities on this point, including Champagne Heidsieck et Cie Monopole Societe Anonyme v Buxton [1930] 1 Ch 330.

The broad propositions noted above were made in quite a different commercial context.\",\"14\":\"79 In any event, a finding that Brother America was part of the supply chain of the impugned products would not allow Dynamic Supplies to rely on s 123 of the Act because it is the consent of the registered owner which must be acquired. Here, Brother Japan is the registered owner of Brother's Australian trade marks. There is no evidence, and Dynamic Supplies submitted that it should not be expected to adduce such evidence, that Brother Japan (rather than Brother America) consented to the application of its mark to or in relation to the products in question. The fact that Brother America and Brother Japan are related entities within the same corporate group does not affect the clear and ordinary meaning and operation of s 123 of the Act . The consent to apply Brother's Australian trade marks to or in relation to a product must be acquired from Brother Japan. The situation where consent is not acquired from the registered owner of the trade mark but from a related entity in its corporate group has not, so far as I am aware, been considered in Australian law: cf the decision of the English Court of Appeal, which was decided on the basis of significantly different legislation in Revlon Inc v Cripps and Lee [1980] FSR 85. I am of the view that Brother Japan's consent for the purposes of s 123 of the Act is not to be implied from the fact that another member of the Brother corporate group may have, contrary to my finding, given its consent.\\n\\n80 Accordingly, Dynamic Supplies' use of the 'BROTHER' trade mark was not done with the licence or authority of Brother Japan. I therefore find that its infringement of Brother's Australian trade marks is not excused by s 123 of the Act .\\n\\n81 Although there was some uncertainty during the hearing as to whether Dynamic Supplies had conceded that Brother had a reputation for the purposes of ss 52 and 53 of the TPA, Dynamic Supplies' ultimate position was that it acknowledged Brother's reputation, but said that its acknowledgment did not constitute a concession as to Brother's trade practices claim. There was no substantial dispute between the parties on this, nor was there significant cross-examination by counsel for Dynamic Supplies on the issue. The uncontested evidence led by Brother showed that Brother Australia has been active in Australia since 1977 and that its sales run into the tens of millions of dollars. Advertisement of its products has been extensive. In cross-examination, Mr Piccinini acknowledged that Brother is a \\\" well-known brand \\\".\",\"15\":\"54 Section 7(4) defines 'use' of a trade mark not only as the application of the mark to the product itself, but also the application of the mark to other items relating to the product, such as packaging, invoices, correspondence and advertisements: see Thunderbird Products Corporation v Thunderbird Marine Products Pty Ltd [1974] HCA 51 ; (1974) 131 CLR 592 at 600 (per Jacobs J); Angoves Pty Ltd v Johnson (1982) 43 ALR 349 at 359-360 (per Deane J); Davison M, Johnston K and Kennedy P, Shanahan's Australian Law of Trade Marks & Passing Off (3 rd ed, Lawbook Co., 2003) at [2.145] and [2.230].

In Coca-Cola Company v All-Fect Distributors Ltd [1999] FCA 1721 ; (1999) 96 FCR 107, the Full Court observed at 119 that a trade mark is infringed if it is shown that the alleged infringer has used the trade mark in such a way as to indicate that it is the source or origin of the goods.\\n\\n51 In some circumstances, a retailer or importer may be said to lawfully 'use' a trade mark owned by an overseas manufacturer: see Transport Tyre 93 FCR at 440; Pioneer 137 CLR at 688; W.D. & H.O. Wills (Australia) Ltd v Rothmans Ltd [1956] HCA 15 ; (1956) 94 CLR 182 at 188. However, where a retailer imports for sale goods which are in packaging bearing a counterfeit trade mark, that importation will be an infringing 'use' of the mark. This is an application of the principle accepted by Lindgren J in Playboy Enterprises International Inc v Hong (2004) 63 IPR 533 at 538 and briefly described in Blanco White TA and Jacobs R, Kerly's Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names (12 th ed, Sweet & Maxwell, 1986) at [14-13].\\n\\n78 The second ground on which Dynamic Supplies' submissions fail is that even if Brother America was part of the supply chain, it has not demonstrated that Brother Japan, the registered owner of the relevant trade marks, expressly or impliedly consented to the application of its trade mark to or in relation to the goods in question. Although the Full Court of this Court in Transport Tyre 93 FCR at 440 found that the sale of the goods in question constituted a 'use', which was excused by s 123 of the Act , that decision is distinguishable. In that case the registered owner of the trade mark applied it to the goods which were subsequently sold. The chain of supply could be traced back from the retailer of the goods to the registered owner of the trade marks which were applied to or in relation to those goods. The registered owner's consent for the purpose of s 123 was, in the opinion of the Full Court, necessarily implied in those circumstances. No such chain of supply exists in the present case. The Sample Units were not branded by Brother with its mark, and the Sample Packaging was counterfeit. No consent, whether express or implied, was given by Brother to any person or entity to apply its registered trade mark to the products. To the contrary, Brother has distanced itself from the OEM products, manufacturing them only as unbranded products and selling them only through a confidential arrangement with Company X.\",\"17\":\"\"}}"
