In other words, once a prospective applicant has enough information to meet the threshold of \\\"a bare pleadable case\\\" ( C7 Pty Ltd v Foxtel Management Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1864 at [44] ), an order under O 15A r 6 is no longer appropriate. Simply because it may be difficult to ascertain the finer detail of those pleadings and assess with accuracy the likelihood of success does not mean the prospects of success in the litigation should be amplified for the prospective applicant through the effects of an invasive order for preliminary discovery. An applicant which is unsuccessful in its preliminary discovery application can always plead its case as best it can, acquire further information and documentation through the ordinary processes of discovery and issue of subpoenas, and then, if necessary, amend its pleadings to assert further or different breaches of its rights or abandon any grounds or causes of action no longer considered tenable.\",\"2\":\"39 A second consideration in relation to the Court's discretion is that Tibra could suffer undue prejudice in respect of the conduct of the anticipated proceedings. Preliminary discovery is an invasive process, and can be granted only where the three limbs of O 15A r 6 are made out. One reason for this is that the grant of preliminary discovery, particularly if the application is as broadly drawn as it is in this case, can place the prospective defendant in a position of disadvantage in respect of the conduct of future negotiations and proceedings: see C7 Pty Ltd v Foxtel Management Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 1266 at [7] . Unlike full discovery, where both parties can ascertain and test the strength of the case put against them, preliminary discovery is unilateral, and the Court should be wary of creating an imbalance between the parties, since the purpose of preliminary discovery is not to furnish an applicant with information of such breadth or significance as to prejudice or unnecessarily curtail the respondent's prospects in the proceedings, but rather to ensure an applicant is able to identify and consider the documents and information necessary to commence proceedings.\\n\\n40 I am of the view that the disclosure at this early stage of Tibra's source code, particularly in circumstances where Optiver already has sufficient information to decide whether to start litigation, would not be consistent with the purposes of O 15A r 6 and would create an inappropriate imbalance between Optiver and Tibra in respect of any litigation.\\n\\n41 For the above reasons, I dismiss the application with costs.\\n\\n I certify that the preceding forty-one (41) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Tamberlin. \\n\\n Associate:\\n\\nDated: 21 December 2007\\n\\n Counsel for the Applicant: Mr R Cobden SC and Mr P Flynn \\n \\n Solicitor for the Applicant: Mallesons Stephen Jaques \\n \\n Counsel for the Respondent: Mr A Bannon SC and Mr A Fox \\n \\n Solicitor for the Respondent: McCabe Terrill Lawyers \\n \\n Date of Hearing: 30 November 2007 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 21 December 2007 \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2007\\/2065.html\",\"3\":\"37 I am not satisfied that information of such sensitivity to Tibra should be disclosed at this early stage. The authorities, taken together, stress that the confidentiality of the information sought in a preliminary discovery application is a relevant consideration in the discretion of the Court to grant the relief, but not an overriding consideration: Griffin Energy Pty Ltd v Western Power Corporation [2006] FCA 1241 at [110] ; Telstra Corporation Limited v Minister for Communications, Information, Technology and the Arts [2007] FCA 1331 at [31] - [32] . The Court has tended to permit applicants to erect suitable regimes to ensure the confidentiality of any material acquired by way of preliminary discovery. In this case, however, despite Optiver's proposal of a confidentiality regime, the exercise of the general discretion to refuse preliminary discovery is supported by two other considerations.\",\"4\":\"27 It is settled law that the purpose of preliminary discovery is not to procure documents that will strengthen an applicant's decision to commence proceedings, but rather to furnish it with information which is reasonably necessary to enable that decision to be made: see Matrix Film Investment One Pty Ltd v Alameda Films LLC [2006] FCA 591 at [19] .

Optiver also referred to the observation by Sackville J in Quanta Software International Pty Ltd v Computer Management Services Pty Ltd (2000) 175 ALR 536 at 543 to the effect that an order under O 15A r 6 may be available to assess the extent of any alleged infringement of an applicant's rights. While these are correct statements of principle, I do not believe they are decisive in this case.\\n\\n33 The observation by Sackville J in Quanta Software 175 ALR at 543 was made in the context of dismissing the clearly untenable proposition that \\\"documents relating only to quantum are necessarily irrelevant in determining whether an applicant has satisfied O 15A r 6(b).\\\" This does not mean that the extent of the alleged infringement must always be relevant to every preliminary discovery application in which the applicant hopes for a greater or more wide-ranging form of relief. The notion of \\\"reasonable sufficiency\\\" articulated by Lindgren J in Alphapharm Pty Ltd v Eli Lilly Australia Pty Ltd (unreported, 24 May 1996) at 24 requires only that uncertainty about the available type and extent of relief be taken into account as one of the considerations relevant to the test in O 15A r 6(b), and that it not be treated as decisive.\",\"6\":\"28 It follows that an applicant, upon obtaining enough information to plead its case, is no longer entitled to preliminary discovery. Delay may also be important: see Western Bulk Carriers (Aust) Pty Ltd v Cosco Bulk Carrier Co Ltd [2002] FCA 1520 at [25] . Once an applicant has obtained information sufficient to plead its case, or has unnecessarily delayed that acquisition, preliminary discovery will not be ordered, and the proceedings must commence. The threshold, once crossed, arrests the preliminary discovery process: see Ricegrowers Co-Operative Ltd & Seatide Pty Ltd v ABC Containerline NV & MED Containerline Antwerp NV (1996) 138 ALR 480 at 484.\",\"7\":\"22 The principles concerning whether an applicant for preliminary discovery has a \\\"reasonable cause to believe\\\" are well established, and are summarised by Hely J in St George Bank Ltd v Rabo Australia Ltd (2004) 211 ALR 147 at 153-154. I do not propose to repeat those principles here.\\n\\n23 In this case, Optiver has reasonable cause to believe that it may have a right to obtain relief from Tibra. The circumstances outlined above, when taken together, provide sufficient objective basis on which that belief is grounded. I am persuaded that Optiver's belief goes beyond mere conjecture or supposition; rather, Optiver has reasonably formed a conclusion that the circumstances surrounding the departure of its employees and the success of their subsequent business may depend to some degree on a breach of a duty of confidence owed to Optiver or a breach of its copyright.\\n\\n24 It is important to stress that the above view does not mean that Optiver's belief is correctly held, in the sense that it is likely to be vindicated in the proceedings. The evidence presently before the Court does not, and need not, go so far as to establish a prima facie case or crystallise a successful cause of action. Under O 15A r 6(a), Optiver's evidence need only establish a tenable objective basis for its belief, which it has done. Accordingly, while Tibra's submissions regarding the shortcomings in Optiver's evidence are important, they are not sufficient to weaken the objective grounds on which Optiver asserts its belief to the extent that O 15A r 6(a) is not satisfied. Shortcomings will be relevant if and when the dispute progresses to hearing, at which stage detailed evidence can be fully adduced and weighed.\\n\\n25 Although the parties disagreed whether Optiver had made all reasonable inquiries before bringing this application, in my view, O 15A r 6(b) is determinative in this case because it prohibits the Court exercising its discretion to grant preliminary discovery where the applicant has sufficient information to enable it to decide whether to commence proceedings to obtain the relief referred to in O 15A r 6(a).\\n\\n26 I am persuaded that Optiver is equipped with sufficient information to decide whether to commence proceedings to obtain at least some of the relief which it submits may be available to it.\",\"8\":\"37 I am not satisfied that information of such sensitivity to Tibra should be disclosed at this early stage. The authorities, taken together, stress that the confidentiality of the information sought in a preliminary discovery application is a relevant consideration in the discretion of the Court to grant the relief, but not an overriding consideration: Griffin Energy Pty Ltd v Western Power Corporation [2006] FCA 1241 at [110] ; Telstra Corporation Limited v Minister for Communications, Information, Technology and the Arts [2007] FCA 1331 at [31] - [32] .
