"{\"id\":{\"0\":\"c0\"},\"class\":{\"0\":\"cited\"},\"tocase\":{\"0\":\"Williams v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 2) [2009] FCA 548\"},\"text\":{\"0\":\"I have been referred to the penalties imposed in numerous cases. However many were pursuant to the WR Act which provided for significantly lower maximum penalties. The penalties which I have imposed are generally consistent with those imposed by Jessup J in Williams v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 2) [2009] FCA 548. The conduct in that case was somewhat more serious than in this. However the penalties for individual breaches were reduced to reflect the overall extent of the misconduct.\\n\\nI will make declarations in terms of paras 48 and 49 of the applicant's submissions as follows: \\n \\n Upon the admissions which the respondents made in the amended defence filed on 7 July 2009 and agreed statement of facts filed on 29 July 2009, it is declared that: \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n (a) On 23 June 2008, [the first respondent] contravened section 44(1) of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005 (Cth) by asking an employer to:\\n (i) terminate its current workplace agreement; and \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n (ii) enter into a new workplace agreement with the CFMEU; \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n (iii) on the basis that if the employer did not do so, the employer would be: \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n (A) banned from building sites across Australia; and \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n (B) subjected to a workplace health and safety audit which would result in the employer spending a significant amount of money, at least $30,000, \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n in that [the first respondent] intended to coerce the employer to terminate its existing workplace agreement and enter into a new workplace agreement with the CFMEU. \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n (b) On 23 June 2008, the CFMEU contravened section 44(1) of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005 (Cth) by virtue of the conduct of its officer, Tim Nesbit, in asking an employer to: \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n (i) terminate its current workplace agreement; and \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n (ii) enter into a new workplace agreement with the CFMEU; \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n (iii) on the basis that if the employer did not do so, the employer would be: \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n (A) banned from building sites across Australia; and \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n (B) subjected to a workplace health and safety audit which would result in the employer spending a significant amount of money, at least $30,000, \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n in that [the first respondent] intended to coerce the employer to terminate its existing workplace agreement and enter into a new workplace agreement with the CFMEU.\\n\\nI order that the first respondent pay to the Commonwealth of Australia a pecuniary penalty fixed at $9,000.
