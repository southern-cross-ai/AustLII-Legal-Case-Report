Although roadworthy, the vehicle in question, a Range Rover, misfired at all road speeds, had excessive noise emitting from the gear box and substantial defects in the body work. The judge at first instance held that the vehicle was of merchantable quality because it was roadworthy and capable of proceeding from one place to another. This finding was set aside on appeal. Mustill LJ said at 944:\\n \\n Starting with the purpose for which 'goods of that kind' are commonly bought, one would include in respect of any passenger vehicle not merely the buyer's purpose of driving the car from one place to another but of doing so with the appropriate degree of comfort, ease of handling and reliability and, one might add, of pride in the vehicle's outward and interior appearance. What is the appropriate degree and what relative weight is to be attached to one characteristic of the car rather than another will depend on the market at which the car is aimed.\\n\\n33 Plainly enough, the purpose for which a commercial vehicle of this kind is commonly bought would include the purpose of being used to transport heavy loads of goods over long distances interstate safely, reliably and efficiently. The loads carried by the truck in this case were not said to be other than within the common range. Indeed, Mack conceded that the interstate long distance haulage of loads of the kind allegedly carried by the truck in the course of the Lowes' business was a \\\"purpose for which trucks, such as the Lowe truck in question, would commonly be utilised\\\". Thus, the first issue to arise under s 71(1) was not in dispute.\\n\\n35 In this connection too, the observations of Mustill LJ, in Rogers v Parish at 944, though apropos a different kind of vehicle, are helpful: \\n \\n To identify the relevant expectation one must look at the factors listed in the subsection. The first is the description applied to the goods. In the present case the vehicle was sold as new. Deficiencies which might be acceptable in a secondhand vehicle were not to be expected in one purchased as new. Next, the description 'Range Rover' would conjure up a particular set of expectations, not the same as those relating to an ordinary saloon car, as to the balance between performance, handling, comfort and resilience. The factor of price was also significant. At more than 14,000 [pounds] this vehicle was, if not at the top end of the scale, well above the level of the ordinary family saloon. The buyer was entitled to value for his money. \\n \\n With these factors in mind, can it be said that the Range Rover as delivered was as fit for the purpose as the buyer could reasonably expect? The point does not admit of elaborate discussion. I can only say that to my mind the defects in engine, gearbox and bodywork, the existence of which is no longer in dispute, clearly demand a negative answer.\\n\\n36 The critical question is whether the applicants' truck suffered from some or all of the defects the applicants allege. The outcome of the case very much depends on the answer to this question. For this reason, in this case, s 71(1) and (2) give rise to substantially the same question.\\n\\n37 Mack accepts that the applicants made it known to it that they were acquiring the truck for interstate long-haul goods transport. This entitles them to rely on s 71(2), as well as s 71(1). Indeed, Mack accepts that it assured them that the truck was fit for this purpose. It is common ground, therefore, there was an implied condition under the contract for supply that the truck was at the time of supply reasonably fit for this purpose. As noted, Mack did not seek to argue at trial that s 71(2) was unavailable to the applicants because they did not rely on Mack's skill and judgment or the skill and judgment of Mr Kumnick.\\n\\n38 Although the notion of reasonable fitness for purpose is not precisely the same as the concept of merchantability, in this case there is no significant difference. There is here an overlap in the operation of s 71(1) and (2) and, under both, the real question is whether or not the truck was fit for the purpose of interstate long-haul goods transport. At trial the applicants and Mack accepted that this was so, and the applicants relied on the same facts to demonstrate a failure on Mack's part to meet both s 71(1) and (2).\\n\\n39 Of course, even if the applicants establish that the truck was not fit for the purpose of interstate long-haul goods transport, there is a further question whether or not they are entitled to the relief they seek.\\n\\n40 As already noted, besides their unmerchantability or unfitness for purpose claim, the applicants also retained a limited claim under s 52 of the TPA. This was to the effect that Mack's representations (via its salesman, Mr Kumnick) that:\\n \\n \\n \\u2022 the truck would provide safe, reliable and efficient service for at least 800,000 kilometres; and \\n \\u2022 driving the truck was like driving a car \\n \\n\\nwere misleading and deceptive, or likely to mislead or deceive, in contravention of s 52 of the TPA. As it happened, there was no great dispute as to whether Mr Kumnick made these statements to the applicants. Mr Kumnick admitted making the second statement and that he said something like the first. Thus, in an affidavit sworn before trial, he said that he told Mr Lowe that the truck should prove to be \\\"safe and reliable\\\" for about 800,000 kilometres. He also told Mr Lowe that the truck would be ideally suited for his purpose of interstate haulage. Mr Kumnick emphasized that he made this latter statement and the observation that the trucks \\\"drive like cars\\\" in the context of talking to an experienced heavy vehicle driver.\\n\\n41 Section 52 of the TPA prohibits a corporation from engaging in conduct in trade and commerce that is misleading or deceptive, or that is likely to mislead or deceive. The words \\\"engage in conduct\\\" include the making of representations about a past, present or future matter. It is not in issue that, for the purposes of s 52 of the TPA, the respondent is a corporation engaged in trade and commerce.\",\"4\":\"30 Subsection 66(2) of the TPA provides that goods are of merchantable quality if they are as fit for the purpose or purposes for which goods of that kind are commonly bought as is reasonable to expect having regard to: (1) any description applied to them by the corporation; (2) the price received for them; and (3) all other relevant circumstances.

There is no claim for repairs or loss calculated by reference to the price the applicants paid for the truck and its true worth. As discussed below, the evidence led in connection with loss of profits is fundamentally flawed. There is a claim for loss of time for 73 days, which has not been proved. These observations confirm my conclusion that, as the applicants' counsel said, this cause of action can in fact add little to the applicants' primary case.\\n\\n58 Mr Lowe's evidence was critical to the applicants' case. Mr Lowe was forty-nine years of age when he acquired the truck. He was a qualified mechanic and an experienced truck driver. He had more than twenty years' experience of driving a number of different heavy prime mover vehicles in long-haul interstate transport operations. Mr Lowe and his wife had begun their long-haul goods transport business over twenty years before the purchase of the truck. He had owned and operated numerous different model trucks prior to March 1998, including three Mack trucks. In September 1997, some months before the purchase of the truck in March 1998, he and his wife purchased a new Tautliner semi-trailer. The truck was to be used to transport this semi-trailer, loaded with goods.\\n\\n59 On or shortly before Friday, 20 March 1998, Mr Lowe spoke to Mr Kumnick at Mack's Adelaide office about buying a new truck to replace the Mack CHR he was operating at that time. Mr Lowe and Mr Kumnick had regular dealings with one another at this time. In this circumstance, Mr Kumnick knew that the replacement truck was for use in interstate haulage. Mr Kumnick made an appraisal of Mr Lowe's Mack CHR and looked into what Mack might offer by way of a replacement.\",\"21\":\"191 Subject to the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth), evidence that is relevant in a proceeding is admissible. In order, however, for 'expert' opinion evidence to be admissible, it must fall within s 79 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth). This is because opinion evidence is generally inadmissible (see s 76) but s 79 provides that:\\n \\n If a person has specialised knowledge based on the person's training, study or experience, the opinion rule does not apply to the evidence of an opinion of that person that is wholly or substantially based on that knowledge. \\n\\nThis provision enacts the common law in important respects, although it has consequences of its own. In HG v The Queen [1999] HCA 2 ; (1999) 197 CLR 414 at 427, Gleeson CJ said:\\n \\n ... the provisions of s 79 will often have the practical effect of emphasising the need for attention to requirements of form. By directing attention to whether an opinion is wholly or substantially based on specialised knowledge based on training, study or experience, the section requires that the opinion is presented in a form which makes it possible to answer that question.\\n\\n192 Section 79 primarily requires:\\n (a) identification of a relevant field of specialised knowledge;\\n (b) a showing that, by reason of training, study or experience, the witness has that specialised knowledge; and \\n \\n (c) a showing that the opinion evidence of the witness is wholly or substantially based on that specialised knowledge.\",\"22\":\"193 Furthermore, the facts and assumptions on which the witness bases his or her opinion must be identified and proved, and constitute a proper foundation for the opinion expressed.

A want of independence, in the case of an expert witness said to be affected by interest or bias, tends to affect the weight to be given to his or her opinion: see FGT Custodians Pty Ltd v Fagenblat [2003] VSCA 33 (\\\" FGT Custodians \\\") at [12] per Ormiston JA, with whom Chernov and Eames JJA agreed.\",\"31\":\"195 It is also accepted that an expert witness is not an advocate for a party and has a paramount duty to the Court and not to the person retaining him: see 'Guidelines for Expert Witnesses' applicable in this Court and National Justice Compania Naviera SA v Prudential Assurance Co Ltd [1993] 2 Lloyd's Rep 68 at 81-82 per Creswell J.

I do not consider that Mr Lambert's involvement with Mr Haire would necessarily have affected the evidence he gave. I note too that Mr Morrison was also involved as an expert in other proceedings though for the truck manufacturer. Involvement in other proceedings in the same or similar interest need not affect independence. It was, moreover, clear that Mr Lambert gave evidence of opinions he genuinely held. Nonetheless, it was equally clear that Mr Lambert was inclined to 'side' with the applicants. His apparent commitment to the applicants' position indicated more than intellectual attraction to their position. Precisely why Mr Lambert was so disposed is unclear. As the respondent noted, he had not seen 'eye to eye' with the Roaduser's management or with Mr Wallace from Mack. I doubt, however, that this is a sufficient explanation. It is enough to say that Mr Lambert impressed me as a witness who had, for whatever reason, become somewhat overly involved in the interests of a party to the litigation. As Ormiston JA's discussion in FGT Custodians at [12] makes clear, this circumstance may diminish the weight accorded an expert's opinion. Here, it lessened to some degree the weight I might otherwise have given Mr Lambert's opinion. In the end, however, my preference for Dr Morrison's opinion to that of Mr Lambert's was more affected by considerations other than this. I would add that there was no occasion to exercise my discretion under s 135 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth).\\n\\n222 There were a number of other matters that also tended to diminish the weight to be attached to Mr Lambert's evidence, including that, in cross-examination, it became apparent that much of his technical opinion was not based on any actual testing of the applicants' truck. Thus, for example, Mr Lambert conceded that he had done no testing to establish the relative torsional rigidity of trailers. Instead, his opinion was based on the fact that he had \\\"a very good eye for observing vehicle behaviour\\\". Further, Mr Lambert stated he used his \\\"own observation and measurements\\\" to establish the chassis was bent. When asked whether he established first whether the ground surface was flat, he conceded \\\"Well, I didn't check it in an absolute sense, no ... I have got a very good eye for flat surfaces\\\".\\n\\n223 Notwithstanding these reservations, I have found it necessary to consider Mr Lambert's evidence carefully.\",\"32\":\"196 In the present context, the respondent also drew attention to s 135 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth), which confers a discretion to refuse to admit evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might: (a) be unfairly prejudicial to a party; (b) be misleading or confusing; or (c) cause or result in undue waste of time. It seems that the failure of a witness to comply with relevant 'Guidelines for Expert Witnesses' may be a factor weighing in favour of the exclusion of his or her evidence, since the expert's opinion is infected by failure to understand his or her responsibilities as an expert: compare United Rural Enterprises Pty Ltd v Lopmand Pty Ltd [2003] NSWSC 870 at [15] - [19] per Campbell J.\\n\\n197 The respondent objected to the admissibility of the opinion of Dr McLean on the basis that:\\n (a) he lacked the requisite \\\"specialised knowledge\\\"; and\\/or\\n \\n \\n (b) he purported to give opinion on matters outside any \\\"specialised knowledge\\\" he may possess as a result of his training, study or experience; and\\/or\\n (c) his evidence demonstrated fundamental flaws in its factual basis or in its process of reasoning. \\n \\n\\nThe respondent argued that Dr McLean's evidence should be excluded entirely, alternatively, admitted only for the purpose of providing expert opinion on matters relating to the alleged vibration problems of the Lowes' truck.\\n\\n198 It was apparently common ground that, as at May 2007, Dr McLean was a senior lecturer in the School of Mechanical, Materials and Mechatronics Engineering, in the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Wollongong.

It follows that a party claiming damages for breach of such an obligation asserts a right which owes its existence to federal law thereby, in a State court, attracting the exercise of federal jurisdiction invested under s 39(2) of the Judiciary Act . \\n \\n\\nIf, as the High Court stated, a State court deciding a s 71 claim is exercising federal jurisdiction under s 39(2) of the Judiciary Act , then it follows that a federal court can entertain the same claim under s 39B(1A)(c) because the obligation created by s 71 \\\"owes its existence to federal law\\\". See also LNC Industries Ltd v BMW (Australia) Ltd [1983] HCA 31 ; (1983) 151 CLR 575. In any event, the applicants' s 52 claim would provide an independent basis for jurisdiction over the s 71 claim.\",\"35\":\"267 Had a breach of the condition created by s 71 occurred, would the applicants' damages claim have been made out? The applicants' statement of claim sought damages or compensation by reference to various provisions of the TPA, including ss 73 , 75AD, 82 and 87 . At no stage in the proceeding, however, have the parties referred again to s 73. The authorities are clear that no action for damages lies under s 82 for breach of a condition implied by s 71 of the TPA: see Austral Pacific Group Ltd (in liq) v Airservices Australia [2000] HCA 39 ; (2000) 203 CLR 136 (\\\" Austral \\\") at 141 per Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Hayne JJ, citing Brennan J in Arturi v Zupps Motors Pty Ltd (1980) 49 FLR 283 at 285-286. Provisions such as ss 75AD and 87 are of no assistance in this context. I accept, however, that the Court may award damages in respect of a breach of a s 71 condition by virtue of s 39B(1A)(c) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth).

The prima facie measure of that loss is \\\"the difference between the value of the goods at the time of delivery to the buyer and the value they would have had if they had answered to the warranty\\\": compare Hadley v Baxendale [1854] EWHC Exch J70 ; (1854) 9 Ex 341 at 354; (1854) 156 ER 145 at 151; AFA Electronics Pty Ltd v Strathfield Group Wholesale Pty Ltd [2001] VCS 289 at [88], discussing s 59 of the Goods Act 1958 (Vic).
