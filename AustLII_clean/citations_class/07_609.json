This finding and approach were correct: Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 272.\\n\\nBy notice of appeal filed on 5 January 2007 the appellant raises the following unparticularised grounds, that essentially assert that the Federal Magistrate erred, by not finding that the Tribunal erred as alleged in the grounds below: \\n \\n \\n 1. It is not reasonable that the Refugee Review Tribunal did not accept that I am a Falun Gong practitioner while the Tribunal accepts that I have ever observed other persons practice Falun Gong in China.\\n \\n \\n \\n 2. The decision made by the Tribunal is illogical.\\n \\n 3. I believe that my fear of persecution is well-founded.\\n\\nAt the hearing of the appeal before me the appellant, assisted by an interpreter essentially repeated the content of her grounds of appeal and overall sought to challenge the findings of fact by the Tribunal that she was not nor ever had been a practitioner of Falun Gong.\\n\\nIn any event an error of fact does not amount to error of law: Abebe v Commonwealth [1999] HCA 14 ; (1999) 197 CLR 510 at [137] . To grant relief for such an error would be to grant merits review, which is impermissible ( Wu Shan Liang at [272]). No jurisdictional error is made out.\\n\\nGround 3 is, in substance, an impermissible application for merits review: Wu Shan Liang at [272].\\n\\nIn my opinion, the approach taken and the findings of the Tribunal and the Federal Magistrate were correct. No jurisdictional error has been made out. The appeal must be dismissed. The appellant should pay the costs of the first respondent, fixed at $2,800. \\n\\n\\n I certify that the preceding twenty-six (26) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gilmour. \\n\\n Associate:\\nDated: 30 April 2007\\n\\n\\n The Appellant appeared for herself: \\n \\n \\n Counsel for the Respondent: B O'Donnell \\n \\n Solicitors for the Respondent: Australian Government Solicitor \\n \\n Date of Hearing: 30 April 2007 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 30 April 2007 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2007\\/609.html\",\"2\":\"The Tribunal concluded that although it was accepted that the appellant may have observed other people practising Falun Gong in both China and Australia, the appellant herself was not a Falun Gong practitioner. There is nothing, in my opinion, which is either not reasonable or illogical in this finding. Observing other practitioners of Falun Gong, of itself, says nothing about whether the appellant was or was not herself such a practitioner. The finding of fact of the Tribunal that she was not a practitioner of Falun Gong was the product of the Tribunal's evaluation of the credibility of the appellant's testimony based on internal consistency, inherent implausibility and consistency with independent country information that was clearly within the Tribunal's jurisdiction: Re Minister; Ex parte Durairajasingham [2000] HCA 1 ; (2000) 168 ALR 407 (HCA) at [67]; W148\\/00A v Minister (2001) 185 ALR 703 (FCAFC) at [64]-[65].\\n\\nThe Tribunal, as the primary fact finder, has stated in its findings that it did not believe the appellant to be a Falun Gong practitioner. Although the Tribunal must give reasons for its decision, it is not required to give reasons for each particular finding in relation to the appellant's claims ( Re Minister; Ex parte Durairajasingham at [67]).\",\"3\":\"The Tribunal concluded that although it was accepted that the appellant may have observed other people practising Falun Gong in both China and Australia, the appellant herself was not a Falun Gong practitioner.

The Tribunal, as he stated was clearly aware of that element of the applicant's claims\\\" and dealt with it as part of a more general conclusion.
