The learned Federal Magistrate observed that, despite this contention, there was no doubt that the MRT was familiar with all the reports. This was because the exchange of correspondence between the MRT and the doctors led to the preparation of the reports. His Honour observed that in those circumstances it was difficult to accept that the MRT did not have regard to all of the reports. He went on to say that the MRT was not required to record in its decision all the material that it had considered. Reference was made to the decision of a Full Court in MZWBW v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 94.\\n\\nThe learned Federal Magistrate also observed at [25] that the appellant knew exactly what he was required to prove and was given the opportunity of obtaining the evidence. His Honour said that Dr Patapanian's clear diagnosis was that there was no substantial medical or clinical basis for any claim of discomfort on the appellant's part. He also said that it was open for the MRT to conclude that the appellant did not have a condition that would prevent him from travelling long distances.\\n\\nMr Young, counsel for the appellant, conceded that the appellant's grounds of appeal may be reduced to two. The first ground is that the MRT failed to have regard in its reasons to important material going to an essential issue in the case.\\n\\nThe second ground is that the MRT failed to take into account relevant considerations, namely the existence of other medical evidence, in particular the report of Dr Dinakar dated 30 May 2004.\\n\\nThe substance of Mr Young's argument was that the MRT fell into error because it failed to have regard to the other medical evidence, in particular Dr Dinakar's report of 30 May 2004. He drew attention to those parts of the report which stated that the appellant would be unable to travel long distances.\",\"5\":\"In Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 26 ; (2003) 197 ALR 389, Gummow and Callinan JJ said at [24] that a failure by the Refugee Review Tribunal to respond to a substantial, clearly articulated argument relying upon established facts amounted to a denial of natural justice. However, this does not assist the appellant's argument in the present case because Dranichnikov must be understood as a failure by the tribunal to deal with a claim; see NABE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2004] FCAFC 263 ; (2004) 219 ALR 27 at [63] .\",\"6\":\"To the references I have already given, may be added the remarks of Allsop J (with whom Heerey J relevantly agreed), in Paul v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1196 ; (2001) 113 FCR 396 at [79] .\\n\\nHis Honour there observed that whatever the outer boundaries of relevant and irrelevant considerations, they do not encompass a failure expressly to mention part of a competing body of evidence before the tribunal, provided that the elements or integers of the claim are addressed.\\n\\nHere, it is plain that the MRT addressed the appellant's claim that his medical condition prevented him from travelling overseas. The appellant's submission that the MRT was required to expressly grapple with the other medical evidence is outside the boundaries of judicial review.\\n\\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs. \\n\\n\\n\\n I certify that the preceding forty-three (43) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Jacobson. \\n\\n\\n Associate:\\n\\nDated: 23 AUGUST 2006\\n\\n\\n Counsel for the Appellant: Mr J R Young \\n \\n Solicitor for the Appellant: Simon Diab & Associates \\n \\n Counsel for the Respondent: Mr G T Johnson \\n \\n Solicitor for the Respondent: Phillips Fox \\n \\n Date of Hearing: 11 August 2006 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 23 August 2006 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2006\\/1113.html\",\"7\":\"Also, in Rezaei v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1294 at [57] , Allsop J observed that Yusuf does not stand for the proposition that a tribunal has failed to take into account a relevant consideration merely because it has not referred to a piece of evidence which the Court thinks relevant.\\n\\nTo this may be added the endorsement of the relevant passage in Rezaei by the Full Court in MZWBW (to which Federal Magistrate Lloyd-Jones referred) at [26] and Thirukkumar v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCAFC 268 at [29] .\",\"8\":\"To this may be added the endorsement of the relevant passage in Rezaei by the Full Court in MZWBW (to which Federal Magistrate Lloyd-Jones referred) at [26] and Thirukkumar v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCAFC 268 at [29] .\",\"9\":\"Thus, as was said by a Full Court (French, Sackville and Hely JJ) in WAEE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2003) 75 ALD 630 at [46], it is not necessary for a tribunal to refer to every piece of evidence and every contention of an applicant in its written reasons; there is a distinction between failure to refer to evidence and failure to address a contention which constitutes a claim or an integer of a claim.\\n\\nThis passage of WAEE was referred to with approval by the Full Court in MZWBW at [27]. It was also referred to by Federal Magistrate Lloyd-Jones in his reference to the relevant paragraph of MZWBW.\\n\\nWhen the learned Federal Magistrate's reasons are considered in light of these well established statements of principle, they can be seen to be entirely without error.\\n\\nIndeed, his Honour's finding at [21] that the MRT must have had regard to other medical evidence, including that of Dr Dinakar, though not essential to the correctness of the decision, seems to me to be entirely correct. Given the process which led to the production and submission of Dr Patapanian's report, it is difficult to accept the appellant's submission that the MRT failed to have regard to the earlier reports.\\n\\nWhat is more, the MRT's failure to refer to Dr Dinakar's report is quite understandable. This is because the last sentence of the report of 30 May 2004 specifically deferred to the more expert opinion of a specialist. Dr Patapanian was the very specialist to whom Dr Dinakar referred the appellant for an opinion on the question of whether he was able to travel. Notwithstanding this, Dr Patapanian made no mention of that issue.\\n\\nDr Patapanian's failure to refer to that issue is not supportive of the appellant's claim. As the learned Federal Magistrate said at [25], given the doctor's diagnosis, it was open for the MRT to make a finding that he did not have the condition he asserted.\",\"10\":\"Mr Young submitted that the species of error upon which he relied was not co-extensive with errant fact finding. He relied in particular on the decision of a Full Court (Lee, Carr and Tamberlin JJ) in WAFP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 319.\\n\\nIn WAFP their Honours set aside a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal stating at [19] that the RRT had failed to have regard \\\"to important relevant material going to a central consideration\\\" in the case.\\n\\nThe language used by their Honours in WAFP was broad. It might, in one sense, be thought to support the appellant's submission in the present case. However, in my view, the Full Court in WAFP , by referring to \\\"important relevant material\\\", did not intend to elevate a failure to refer to evidence to a ground of jurisdictional error. If it did, the decision in WAFP would be contrary to established principles.\"}}"
