The Court's task is to assess whether the compromise is fair and reasonable ( Lopez v Star World Enterprises Pty Limited (1999) ATPR 41-678 ; [1999] FCA 104 at [15] per Finkelstein J).\",\"1\":\"The approach to be taken by the Court was recently reviewed by Jessup J in Darwalla Milling Co Pty Ltd v F Hoffman-La Roche Ltd (No 2) (2006) 236 ALR 322. Jessup J pointed out that there is little specificity that can be attached to the words \\\"fair\\\" or \\\"reasonable\\\". His Honour expressed the opinion that the practical judicial approach appears to be to identify any features of a settlement that are obviously unreasonable or unfair ( Darwalla at [39]).\\n\\nThe evidence establishes that the proposed global amount, the methodology for distribution and the effect of the settlement on the payments to be made to the individual members has been adequately set forth to each of those members of the Deacons client group. As was the case in Darwalla, no objection, and no matter said to be unfair or unreasonable, has been raised in this case by any group member who will be covered by the settlement. As a result, I, like Jessup J in Darwalla , am left with only the broadest criteria to assess the reasonableness and fairness of the proposed settlement. Global settlement sum\\n\\nJessup J considered whether the overall settlement sum was reasonable having regard to: the manner of its calculation and its relationship to the best possible case outcome for the group as a whole; the prospects of achieving an outcome at or near the best probable case; the extent of the weaknesses, substantive or procedural, in the applicant's case; whether the settlement sum falls within the realistic range of likely outcomes; the forensic difficulties which would be involved in the conduct of the case to judgment; and the time and costs which have been saved by a settlement at that particular stage of the proceedings ( Darwalla at [41]).\\n\\nAs noted by Jacobson J in Taylor v Telstra Corporation Ltd [2007] FCA 2008 at [63] , Jessup J also said at [50] that he did not consider that it was the Court's function under s 33V to second guess the applicants' advisors in the answer to the question whether the applicants ought to have accepted the respondent's offer. The question is whether the agreed settlement falls within the range of a fair and reasonable outcome, taking everything into account. As Jessup J also pointed out in Darwalla , there is rarely, if ever, a case in which there is a unique outcome which should be regarded as the only fair and reasonable one.\\n\\nAs in Darwalla , there is a settlement distribution scheme which does not specify precisely what the final entitlement of each group member will be under the settlement, although in this case:\",\"2\":\"In the present case, each Deacons client has had the benefit of advice from solicitors and counsel as to how his or her interests are best served in the litigation and by the proposed settlement. My task is to determine whether the proposed settlement is fair and reasonable having regard to the claims made on behalf of the group members who will be bound by the settlement ( Williams v FAI Homes Security Pty Ltd (No 4) [2000] FCA 1925 ; (2000) 180 ALR 459 at [19] per Goldberg J). While the nine factor test adopted by Goldberg J in Williams is not a rigid test to be applied, it is useful as a guide ( Haslam v Money For Living (Aust) Pty Limited (Administrators Appointed) [2007] FCA 897 at [20] per Gordon J.)\",\"3\":\"As Branson J said in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Chats House Investments Pty Limited (1996) 71 FCR 250 at 258: ' it is appropriate for the Court to be satisfied that any settlement or discontinuance of representative proceedings has been undertaken in the interests of the group members as a whole, and not just in the interests of the applicant and the respondent '. The Court's task is to assess whether the compromise is fair and reasonable ( Lopez v Star World Enterprises Pty Limited (1999) ATPR 41-678 ; [1999] FCA 104 at [15] per Finkelstein J).\\n\\nThe evidence provides a basis for calculating the total claims made by or on behalf of the Deacons clients and the percentage of these total claims made up by the individual claims of each Deacons client. This percentage is used to calculate the proportion of the global settlement sum to be paid to each Deacons client, allowing for costs. This enables the Court to understand the basis on which the amounts payable to the individual members of the group have been calculated. Where the global settlement and the method of distribution have been established, the fact that there is a degree of uncertainty in the precise distribution does not prevent approval being given to the settlement ( Lopez ).\\n\\nThere has already been payment by the Deacons clients on account of costs incurred to date. The proposed schedule for distribution takes account of those payments of costs and it follows that the individual group members have been notified of, and approve the quantum of, the costs incurred. I am satisfied that there is no need for further evidence of the reasonableness of those costs.\\n\\nAccordingly, taking account of: the percentage of each claim to be paid to each Deacons client; the prospects of success in the proceedings affecting the likelihood that any Deacons client would obtain judgment for amounts significantly in excess of the settlement offer; the increased costs that would be incurred if the matter proceeded to its conclusion; the opinion of Mr Sharma; the fact that the proposed settlement was recommended by senior and junior counsel for the Deacons clients; the submissions of and support of the settlement by Ms Wilson, appearing for the Deacons clients; the submissions of support of the settlement by senior counsel for Airservices; the existence of a fair and reasonable settlement distribution scheme; and importantly, the fact that all members of the group of Deacons clients have approved the settlement; \\nI am satisfied that it is appropriate so to approve it.\",\"4\":\"The group was thus identified by criteria not limited to those associated with the nature of the claims themselves ( Multiplex Funds Management v P Dawson Nominees [2007] FCAFC 200 ; (2007) 164 FCR 275 at [137] [141] per Jacobson J).\\n\\nWhile I am informed that there are other former employees of Airservices not listed in Attachment 1 who otherwise come within the description set out in paragraph 2 of the application, those persons have not signed an agreement with Deacons. Those persons will not be bound by the proposed settlement.\\n\\nFollowing earlier unsuccessful attempts at settlement, including an attempted mediation, the matter has now been settled between the parties on the basis recorded in a \\\"Deed of Release and Confidentiality\\\".\",\"5\":\"As noted by Jacobson J in Taylor v Telstra Corporation Ltd [2007] FCA 2008 at [63] , Jessup J also said at [50] that he did not consider that it was the Court's function under s 33V to second guess the applicants' advisors in the answer to the question whether the applicants ought to have accepted the respondent's offer.
