In s 10 , the word \\\"communicate\\\" is defined as \\\"make available online or electronically transmit (whether over a path, or a combination of paths, provided by a material substance or otherwise) a work or other subject-matter\\\". Hence, in making the 800 questions and answers available on line over the Internet, RMC and Dallas Gibson communicated the works to the public. These 800 questions and answers were also reproduced in a material form when Dallas Gibson converted them from files stored on Mr Van Tran's compact disks into files stored on Dallas Gibson's laptop and ultimately converted into the practice exams files made available to students through the Icarus College learning management system: see s 21(1A). Pursuant to s 10 , as applicable at the relevant time, \\\"material form\\\", in relation to a work, included \\\"any form (whether visible or not) of storage from which the work ... or a substantial part of the work ... can be reproduced\\\".

Icarus College had 45 practice exams that it provided over the Internet to students who paid for UMAT preparation courses. MedEntry's 800 questions and answers were contained in these 45 practice exams. The gist of the applicants' complaint in these proceedings was that their copyright had been infringed by the respondents' reproduction, via the Icarus College website, of the 800 questions and answers principally created by Ann Boyapati for sections 1 and 2 of MedEntry's practice exams.\",\"1\":\"41 In order to attract copyright protection, a literary work that is a compilation must be original. As Dixon J said in Victoria Park Racing and Recreation Grounds Co Ltd v Taylor [1937] HCA 45 ; (1937) 58 CLR 479 at 511:\\n No doubt the expression 'literary work' includes compilation. The definition section says so ... But some original result must be produced. This does not mean that new or inventive ideas must be contributed. The work need show no literary or other skill or judgment. But it must originate with the author and be more than a copy of other material. \\n\\nIn that case, the High Court held that copyright did not exist in information posted by the race-course proprietors inside the course as to the name and numbers of the starting and scratched horses and the numbers of the winners.\",\"2\":\"42 Whether or not a compilation has sufficient originality to attract copyright depends on the degree of skill, judgment or labour involved in producing it. The Full Court of this Court in Desktop Marketing Systems Pty Ltd v Telstra Corporation Ltd [2002] FCAFC 112 ; (2002) 119 FCR 491 (\\\" Desktop \\\") discussed the concept of originality. Lindgren J, with whom Black CJ agreed, summarised the principles concerning originality (at 532-534) where, amongst other things, his Honour said: \\n 5. One must apply the test of originality to the literary work, including a compilation, in which copyright is claimed to exist, as a whole, rather than dissecting it and applying the test to the individual parts ... 6. The test of originality is whether the work was not copied, but originated from the putative author ... 7. The test is not an 'all or nothing' one but raises a question of fact and degree as to the extent of the putative author's contribution to the making of the particular literary work in questions, in the present case, a compilation ... 8. For this purpose, no particular kind of antecedent work contributed by the putative author is, a priori, to be left out of account, except, perhaps, antecedent work which was undertaken for a purpose or purposes which did not include the making of the literary work at all ... ... 10. ... [T]here is no principle that the labour and expense of collecting, verifying, recording and assembling (albeit routinely) data to be compiled are irrelevant to, or are incapable of themselves establishing, origination, and therefore originality; on the contrary, the authorities strongly suggest that labour of that kind may do so... \\nSee also Desktop at 591 per Sackville J, with whom Black CJ also agreed.\\n\\n43 Sackville J's summary of the relevant principles (at 593) included the following statements:\\n (i) A compilation will ordinarily be an original literary work for copyright purposes if the compiler has exercised skill, judgment or knowledge in selecting the material for inclusion in the compilation ... or in presenting or arranging the material ... (ii) In addition, a compilation of factual information will ordinarily be an original literary work for copyright purposes if the compiler has undertaken substantial labour or incurred substantial expense in collecting the information recorded in the compilation.\",\"3\":\"44 Where the skill, judgment and labour involved in making a compilation is trivial or insubstantial, there may be no originality sufficient to attract copyright: see Desktop at 535 per Lindgren J and Acohs Pty Ltd v RA Bashford Consulting Pty Ltd (1997) 37 IPR 542 at 556 per Merkel J. This is not the case here. The evidence disclosed that the Boyapatis had contributed a sufficient amount of independent skill, judgment and labour to satisfy the requirement for originality.\",\"4\":\"45 The evidence established that Ann Boyapati created about half the questions and answers in the works in suit from scratch. Whilst the evidence established that she derived the balance of the questions and answers from third party sources, she used these sources in different ways, selecting, adapting and modifying them to varying degrees to suit her purpose of compiling sets of practice exams that simulated the UMAT. Even where she made minimal modification to a pre-existing question, she exercised skill and judgment in selecting the question and including it in either section 1 or 2 , depending on whether it concerned logical reasoning or interaction skills. There was also a degree of skill and judgment involved in organising the sequence and, to a lesser extent, the number of questions in sections 1 and 2 so as to simulate the UMAT. The practice exams that she created were therefore a product of her skill, judgment and labour, combined with that of Ray and Edward Boyapati to the extent that they contributed to the process. The skill, judgment and labour involved were sufficiently substantial to attract copyright: compare Desktop at 599 per Sackville J. The preparation for, and the creation and development of, the practice exams were not easy tasks and involved some considerable time and effort on the Boyapatis' part: compare Interlego AG v Tyco Industries Inc [1988] UKPC 3 ; [1989] AC 217 at 263.\",\"5\":\"46 The respondents invited me to infer from the evidence that the third party sources would attract copyright since it might be inferred that the sources had been produced in the last fifty years. The respondents cited Desktop and Autodesk Inc v Dyason [1992] HCA 2 ; (1992) 173 CLR 330 in support of the proposition that there could be no originality in a work that derived \\\"from other copyright sources without permission (or acknowledgement)\\\". This was, so they said, due to a lack of originality. These two cases concerned copyright in factual information and, accordingly, are not directly in point in the present case. In any event, I would reject the respondents' basic submission on two bases. First, I accept that, as the applicants submitted, it would be a question of fact in each case as to whether the applicants had infringed copyright in any particular pre-existing work. Secondly, even if copyright in a pre-existing work was infringed, the proposition for which the respondents contend is unsupported by the authorities and authors learned in the field of copyright.\",\"6\":\"47 In Copyright and Designs (Butterworths, Australia, 2004) at 10,092-10,113 [10,055], James Lahore and Warwick A Rothnie state:\\n Copyright can subsist in a selection of material such as poems, short stories or letters, although the material selected is in the public domain. The copyright is in the selection, not in the component parts of it, and the originality of the work lies in the labour, skill, and discrimination of the author in putting together the material. ... The selection is a new work quite separate from the works selected. Copyright will subsist, for example, in Palgrave's Golden Treasury of Songs and Lyrics although the songs and lyrics may themselves be in the public domain ... The selection by Palgrave was the subject of copyright as a work in itself and irrespective of whether or not copyright subsisted in the individual items selected. ... In the case of compilations that consist entirely of existing material the originality may be found in the selection alone, that is, in the skill labour and judgment involved in making the selection. \\nThere are numerous authorities that can be cited in support of the statements in this passage: see, for example, Ladbroke (Football) Ltd v William Hill (Football) Ltd [1964] 1 WLR 273 (\\\" Ladbroke (Football) Ltd \\\") at 277-278 per Lord Reid, 286-287 per Lord Hodson, 289-290 per Lord Devlin, and 292-293 per Lord Pearce.

The applicant claimed to be the copyright owner in the literary work that was its motorcycle parts catalogue, as updated from time to time. It alleged that the respondents had infringed its copyright by producing the respondents' 1993 parts catalogue. A major issue in the case was whether the applicant's catalogue was the product of copying other catalogues, with the result, so the respondents argued, that the applicant's catalogue was not the subject of copyright. Drummond J rejected this argument. His Honour observed (at 316) that \\\"the question is whether the compilation, looked at as an entity, is original: it is not proper to dissect the work into its parts, and by determining that the individual parts lack originality, to deny originality to the whole work\\\". He concluded that the original version of the applicant's catalogue infringed the copyright in an earlier work. His Honour went on to say, however, that:\\n But, in my opinion, the fact that the 1986 A-One catalogue may be an infringement of the copyright in the 1984 Phoenix catalogue does not prevent A-One having copyright in its own 1986 catalogue. I do not read Ladbroke (Football) Ltd ... as limiting the proposition that, so far as compilations that consist of or include existing material are concerned, originality for the purposes of copyright can be found in the work of selection, to compilations consisting only of material that is not the subject of copyright. In that case, Lord Pearce, in the course of dealing with the question whether the defendants had infringed the plaintiff's copyright in their football coupon by reproducing a substantial part of it, said, at 293: \\n \\n The reproduction of a part which by itself has not originality will not normally be a substantial part of the copyright and therefore will not be protected. For that which would not attract copyright except by reason of its collocation will, when robbed of that collocation, not be a substantial part of the copyright and therefore the courts will not hold its reproduction to be an infringement. It is this, I think, which is meant by one or two judicial observations that 'there is no copyright' in some unoriginal part of a whole that is copyright. They afford no justification, in my view, for holding that one starts the inquiry as to whether copyright exists by dissecting the compilation into component parts instead of starting it by regarding the compilation as a whole and seeing whether the whole has copyright. It is when one is debating whether the part reproduced is substantial that one considers the pirated portion on its own. \\n \\n \\nAlthough Lord Pearce was dealing with the question of infringement where the copyright work was composed of non-original and original material, his Lordship, in the latter part of this statement, in my opinion, clearly accepted that copyright can exist in a compilation even though the compilation consists of partly pirated material and partly non-pirated material. This would seem to follow logically from what the House of Lords had to say in Ladbroke (Football) Ltd to the effect that, so far as compilations of existing material are concerned, originality sufficient to attract copyright in a compilation can be found entirely in the work of selecting the material to be included in the compilation, as opposed to the work of reducing those selections to written form.\\n\\n54 As I have already found, copyright in the works in suit rests with the applicants. Dallas Gibson and RMC uploaded the works in suit onto the Icarus College website as part of their own course materials for their own students. These infringing copies are deemed, by virtue of s 116 of the Copyright Act , to be the property of the copyright owners, being the Boyapatis: see A-One Accessory Imports Pty Ltd v Off Road Imports Pty Ltd (1996) 34 IPR 332. A notice on the Icarus College website stated that it was the owner of the copyright in the materials published on the website. When the respondents made the works in suit available to their students via the Icarus College website, they treated the infringing copies as their own and acted in a manner inconsistent with the applicants' rights as deemed owners and, accordingly, converted them: see Caxton Publishing Co Ltd v Sutherland Publishing Co Ltd [1939] AC 178 at 189 per Lord Russell of Killowen and 202 per Lord Porter..\",\"8\":\"49 Drummond J also referred to Redwood Music Ltd v Chappell & Co Ltd [1982] RPC 109 at 120 per Goff J and Warwick Film Productions Ltd v Eisinger [1969] 1 Ch 508 at 524-525 per Plowman J, both of which supported the proposition that a work might be an original work in which copyright subsisted, even though infringing copyright in an earlier work because it is in part a copy of a substantial part of the earlier copyright work.\",\"9\":\"49 Drummond J also referred to Redwood Music Ltd v Chappell & Co Ltd [1982] RPC 109 at 120 per Goff J and Warwick Film Productions Ltd v Eisinger [1969] 1 Ch 508 at 524-525 per Plowman J, both of which supported the proposition that a work might be an original work in which copyright subsisted, even though infringing copyright in an earlier work because it is in part a copy of a substantial part of the earlier copyright work.\",\"10\":\"50 The respondents also submitted that the evidence showed that it was common for providers of preparation courses for the UMAT and the like to reproduce material from other copyright sources without permission or acknowledgment. Relying on Concrete Pty Ltd v Parramatta Design & Developments Pty Ltd [2006] HCA 55 ; (2006) 229 CLR 577 (\\\" Concrete \\\") at 595-596 per Kirby and Crennan JJ, they argued that this \\\"might be said to give rise to an implied licence or right based on industry practice to 'borrow' or reproduce such material (even though it is accepted that there was no direct or other contractual relationship between the applicants and the respondents in relation to the material)\\\". The relevant passage in Concrete referred to the principle established in cases concerned with architectural drawings and plans, that a licence may be implied where architects, artists and other persons prepare written material on the basis that it should be used in a particular manner for a particular purpose. I do not consider that there is any basis for applying this principle to the subject-matter of this case, even if the evidence were as the respondents contended. The evidence supports the proposition that practice exams are written on the basis that they should be used by students enrolling in the providers' courses for the purpose of preparing for the UMAT and not for the purpose of assisting other commercial providers to make their products.\\n\\n51 It follows from the foregoing that I would reject the respondents' submissions on lack of originality.\\n\\n52 In view of the conclusions I have reached above, it is unnecessary to consider the applicants' claim in so far as it was based on s 38 of the Copyright Act or involved an alleged breach of moral rights. In any event, at trial, the applicants did not strenuously press these alternative bases for the respondents' liability.\",\"11\":\"53 The applicants also relied on s 116 of the Copyright Act . This provision treats a copyright owner as if the copyright owner were also the owner of the infringing articles: see Polygram Pty Ltd v Golden Editions Pty Ltd (No 2) (1997) 38 IPR 451 (\\\" Polygram \\\") per Lockhart J. Section 116 is in the following terms:\\n \\n \\n (1) The owner of the copyright in a work or other subject-matter may bring an action for conversion or detention in relation to: \\n (a) an infringing copy; or \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n (b) a device (including a circumvention device) used or intended to be used for making infringing copies. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n (1A) In an action for conversion or detention, a court may grant to the owner of the copyright all or any of the remedies that are available in such an action as if: \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n (a) the owner of the copyright had been the owner of the infringing copy since the time the copy was made; or\\n (b) the owner of the copyright had been the owner of the device since the time when it was used or intended to be used for making infringing copies. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n (1B) Any relief granted by a court in an action for conversion or detention is in addition to any relief that the court may grant under section 115. \\n \\n (1C) A court is not to grant any relief to the owner of the copyright in an action for conversion or detention if the relief that the court has granted or proposes to grant under section 115 is, in the opinion of the court, a sufficient remedy.\\n \\n (1D) In deciding whether to grant relief in an action for conversion or detention and in assessing the amount of damages payable, the court may have regard to the following: \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n (a) the expenses incurred by the defendant, being a person who marketed or otherwise dealt with the infringing copy, in manufacturing or acquiring the infringing copy;\\n (b) whether the expenses were incurred before or after the infringing copy was sold or otherwise disposed of by the defendant; \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n (c) any other matter that the court considers relevant.\\n \\n (1E) If the infringing copy is an article of which only part consists of material that infringes copyright, the court, in deciding whether to grant relief and in assessing the amount of damages payable, may also have regard to the following: \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n (a) the importance to the market value of the article of the material that infringes the copyright;\\n (b) the proportion the material that infringes copyright bears to the article;\\n (c) the extent to which the material that infringes copyright may be separated from the article.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n (2) A plaintiff is not entitled by virtue of this section to any damages or to any other pecuniary remedy, other than costs, if it is established that, at the time of the conversion or detention: \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n (a) the defendant was not aware, and had no reasonable grounds for suspecting, that copyright subsisted in the work or other subject-matter to which the action relates;\\n (b) where the articles converted or detained were infringing copies the defendant believed, and had reasonable grounds for believing, that they were not infringing copies; or\\n (c) where an article converted or detained was a device used or intended to be used for making articles the defendant believed, and had reasonable grounds for believing, that the articles so made or intended to be made were not or would not be, as the case may be, infringing copies.\\n\\n56 Section 116(1B) provides that the relief that the court grants for conversion is in addition to any relief that the court may grant under s 115 of the Copyright Act . The grant of relief for conversion is, however, subject to the proviso in 116(1C) that the \\\"court is not to grant any relief to the owner of the copyright in an action for conversion ... if the relief that the court ... proposes to grant under section 115 is, in the opinion of the court, a sufficient remedy\\\". In deciding whether to grant relief for conversion and in assessing the amount of damages payable, the court's attention is directed to the factors in s 116(1D) of the Copyright Act , to which it may have regard: see generally Sony Entertainment (Australia) Ltd v Smith [2005] FCA 228 ; (2005) 64 IPR 18 at 34 per Jacobson J and Polygram (1997) 38 IPR 451 at 453-454 per Lockhart J.\\n\\n57 As indicated above, the applicants have made out their case respecting the conversion of infringing copies by the respondents. Neither the applicants nor the respondents have yet made submissions, however, concerning the application of ss 116(1C) and (1D) of the Copyright Act . This may be on account of the Court's order of 10 July 2006, which deferred any questions concerning quantum of damages to a later stage in the proceeding. Accordingly, I propose to invite the parties to make such submissions as they consider appropriate on the application of ss 116(1C) and (1D) of the Copyright Act.\\n\\n58 The respondents rely on ss 115(3) and 116(2), or what is sometimes referred to as the \\\"innocent infringement\\\" defence. In the present context, both provisions raise essentially the same issues.\",\"12\":\"54 As I have already found, copyright in the works in suit rests with the applicants. Dallas Gibson and RMC uploaded the works in suit onto the Icarus College website as part of their own course materials for their own students. These infringing copies are deemed, by virtue of s 116 of the Copyright Act , to be the property of the copyright owners, being the Boyapatis: see A-One Accessory Imports Pty Ltd v Off Road Imports Pty Ltd (1996) 34 IPR 332.

This was because Dallas Gibson's bankruptcy commenced on 18 October 2000 and ended on 19 October 2003: see Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) (\\\"Bankruptcy Act\\\"), s 149(4). It is not entirely clear whether, on Dallas Gibson's version of events, he claimed to have acquired copyright in the cross-claim works in suit before or after his bankruptcy in October 2000. As it happens, nothing particularly turns on this. Section 58(1)(a) of the Bankruptcy Act vests the property of the bankrupt in the trustee when he or she becomes a bankrupt. Section 58(1)(b) vests after-acquired property (as defined in s 58(6)) of the bankrupt after the date of bankruptcy in the trustee as soon as the acquisition or devolution occurs. Section 58(6) provides that, in this context, \\\"after-acquired property\\\" in relation to a bankrupt means \\\"property that is acquired by, or devolves on, the bankrupt on or after the date of the bankruptcy, being property that is divisible amongst the creditors of the bankrupt\\\". Section 116 specifies property that is divisible amongst the creditors of the bankrupt. The term \\\"property\\\" for the purposes of ss 58 and 116 is defined broadly in s 5 of the Bankruptcy Act to mean \\\"real or personal property of every description, whether situate in Australia or elsewhere, and includes any estate, interest or profit, whether present or future, vested or contingent, arising out of or incident to any such real or personal property\\\". This definition encompasses copyright, which s 196(1) of the Copyright Act recognises as a form of personal property: see also Birdseye v Sheahan (2002) 196 ALR 598 at 607 [52] per Carr J. Copyright does not fall within one of the classes of enumerated exceptions in s 116 of the Bankruptcy Act and the Bankruptcy Regulations 1966 (Cth). Accordingly, copyright in the cross-claim works in suit (if it existed) vested in the trustee at the time Dallas Gibson became a bankrupt or as after-acquired property. As at September 2003, Dallas Gibson was incapable of assigning the proprietary interest in the cross-claim works in suit to RMC. Notwithstanding that Dallas Gibson sought to make an assignment of copyright to RMC at this date, RMC in fact acquired nothing. It follows that the purported assignment of the copyright in September 2003 from Dallas Gibson, whilst a bankrupt, was ineffective.\",\"14\":\"89 It seems probable (and it was not suggested otherwise) that Dallas Gibson's bankruptcy ended on 19 October 2003 pursuant to s 149(4) of the Bankruptcy Act , as a consequence of automatic discharge consequent on the expiration of three years from the date he filed his statement of affairs. Section 153 sets out the effect of an automatic discharge. This provision does not, however, have the effect of revesting in the bankrupt the property vested in the trustee: see Official Receiver in Bankruptcy v Schultz [1990] HCA 45 ; (1990) 170 CLR 306 at 320 per Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ; Daemar v Industrial Commission of NSW (No 2) (1990) 99 ALR 789 at 795-796 per Kirby P, Clarke and Meagher JJA agreeing; and Gosden v Dixon (1992) 107 ALR 329 at 331 per McLelland J. There was no evidence that the trustee in bankruptcy had assigned or transferred the copyright to Dallas Gibson since the discharge of his bankruptcy. Assuming that his discharge was by force of s 149(4) , the copyright continued to vest in the trustee in bankruptcy, and neither Dallas Gibson nor RMC is entitled to bring this part of the cross-claim.\",\"15\":\"89 It seems probable (and it was not suggested otherwise) that Dallas Gibson's bankruptcy ended on 19 October 2003 pursuant to s 149(4) of the Bankruptcy Act , as a consequence of automatic discharge consequent on the expiration of three years from the date he filed his statement of affairs.

She had no knowledge of any relevant matter: see Medical Benefits Fund of Australia Ltd v Cassidy [2002] FCA 1097 ; (2003) 205 ALR 402. Her father corroborated her evidence in this regard, saying that these matters were his responsibility. Accordingly, the claim made against Ann Boyapati under s 75B of the TPA that she was knowingly concerned in, or party to, contravening conduct of MedEntry or Anzie in connection with the representations as to third party endorsement must fail.\\n\\n137 When MedEntry (and not Anzie) owned the website, Ray Boyapati was named as the contact person. He gave instructions for the work done on the site and posted the relevant logos on the MedEntry website. His evidence was, and I accept, that his father sent him the material and he put it up on the site. He said that he was aware of the posted material and that he had assumed the relevant organisations had given their consent, without further inquiry. I accept that he had no knowledge of any relevant matter. The claim made against him under s 75B of the TPA must fail.\\n\\n138 For the reasons already stated, the claim made against Edward Boyapati must also fail. Further, as I have said, I accept that, if there had been any contravention of the TPA, this would have been as a result of an inadvertent mistake on the part of Edward Boyapati. There was no evidence that he knew of any matter that would have enabled any representation to be characterised as false. Accordingly, the claim made against him under s 75B of the TPA must fail.\",\"18\":\"142 As Stephen J said (Jacobs J agreeing) in Hornsby Building Information Centre Pty Ltd v Sydney Building Information Centre Ltd (1978) 140 CLR 216 at 229-230:\\n There is a price to be paid for the advantages flowing from the possession of an eloquently descriptive trade name. Because it is descriptive it is equally applicable to any business of a like kind, its very descriptiveness ensures that it is not distinctive of any particular business and hence its application to other like businesses will not ordinarily mislead the public. In cases of passing off, where it is the wrongful appropriation of the reputation of another or that of his goods is in question, a plaintiff which uses descriptive words in its trade name will find that quite small differences in a competitor's trade name will render the latter immune from action ... The risk of confusion must be accepted, to do otherwise is to give to one who appropriates to himself descriptive words an unfair monopoly in those words and might even deter others from pursuing the occupation which the words describe. If this be so in the case of passing off actions the case of s 52(1) , concerned only with the interests of third parties, is a fortiori. To allow this section of the [TPA] to be used as an instrument for the creation of any monopoly in descriptive names would be to mock the manifest intent of the legislation. Given that a name is no more than merely descriptive of a particular type of business, its use by others who carry on the same type of business does not deceive or mislead as to the nature of the business described ... Evidence of confusion in the minds of members of the public is not evidence that the use of the Hornsby Centre's name is itself misleading or deceptive but rather that its intrusion into the field originally occupied by the Sydney Centre has, naturally enough, caused a degree of confusion in the public mind. This is not, however, anything at which s 52(1) is directed. \\n\\nSince the cross-claimants' use of the name \\\"Medical Entrance\\\" is essentially descriptive, they bore a heavy onus to show that the name had gained a secondary meaning referring specifically to the goods and services of their business.\\n\\n143 The evidence established that neither of the cross-claimants had traded under the name \\\"Medical Entrance\\\" alone. The evidence showed that Dallas Gibson (from 2000) and RMC (from September 2003) gave various names to their business and business products, including:\\n \\n(1) UMAT Superprep Courses;\\n \\n(2) Dallas Tertiary Prep Skills;\\n \\n(3) Dallas Medical Entrance;\\n \\n(4) Dallas Super Prep (according to Dallas Gibson, prior to 2004);\\n \\n(5) Tertiary Prep Skills (according to Dallas, this was an \\\"early\\\" usage);\\n \\n(6) Icarus College (from around March 2004); and\\n \\n(7) Dallas SuperKeenEye.\\n \\nThere was little other evidence relating to the reputation of the cross-claimants in the use of the name \\\"Medical Entrance\\\": see also [144]-[145] below.\",\"19\":\"144 Since the cross-claimants used the words \\\"Medical Entrance\\\" descriptively and did not, in any event, trade under these words alone, I reject the proposition that the words \\\"Medical Entrance\\\" had become relevantly associated with them by the end of 2003. When the cross-respondents began their business in early 2004, the cross-claimants did not have a sufficient reputation in the name \\\"Medical Entrance\\\" to support their passing off claim. The fact that \\\"Medical Entrance\\\" was used as the domain name for their website did not establish that they had any reputation in the name.

Further, there was in the circumstances no basis for the cross-claimants' assertion that, by their adoption of the name \\\"MedEntry\\\", the cross-respondents misrepresented that their business was the same as, or relevantly associated with, the cross-claimants' business.

In all jurisdictions other than New South Wales, a trading corporation such as RMC may sue for defamation in so far as the imputations attack its commercial reputation and can generally be shown to have caused some financial harm: see RP Balkin and JLR Davis, Law of Torts (LexisNexis Butterworths Australia, 3 rd ed, 2004) (\\\"Balkin and Davis\\\") at p 563-564.

This question of fact in turn depends on (1) what the words mean; and (2) whether the imputations are defamatory. The intention of the alleged defamer is irrelevant to the question of liability. In Reader's Digest Services Pty Ltd v Lamb [1982] HCA 4 ; (1982) 150 CLR 500 at 505-506, Brennan J, for the Court, said:\\n Where no true innuendo is pleaded and the published words clearly related to the plaintiff, the issue of libel or no libel can be determined by asking whether hypothetical referees Lord Selborne's reasonable men ... or Lord Atkin's right thinking members of society generally ... or Lord Reid's ordinary men not avid for scandal ... would understand the published words in a defamatory sense. That simple question embraces two elements of the cause of action: the meaning of the words used (the imputation) and the defamatory character of the imputation. Whether the alleged libel is established depends upon the understanding of the hypothetical referees who are taken to have a uniform view of the meaning of the language used, and upon the standards, moral or social, by which they evaluate the imputation they understand to have been made. They are taken to share a moral or social standard by which to judge the defamatory character of that imputation ... being a standard common to society generally. \\nConsideration must be given to what the ordinary reasonable reader would think when reading the publication over the Internet.

In Sim v Stretch [1936] 2 All ER 1237 at 1240, Lord Atkin stated the well-accepted test in the following passage:\\n The question, then, is whether the words in their ordinary signification are capable of being defamatory. Judges and textbook writers alike have found difficulty in defining with precision the word 'defamatory'. The conventional phrase exposing the plaintiff to hatred, ridicule and contempt is probably too narrow. The question is complicated by having to consider the person or class of persons whose reaction to the publication is the test of the wrongful character of the words used. I do not intend to ask your Lordships to lay down a formal definition, but after collating the opinions of many authorities I propose in the present case the test: would the words tend to lower the plaintiff in the estimation of right-thinking members of society generally?\\n\\n159 In considering whether words are defamatory, the context in which the words are used must be considered. The whole publication must be considered. The circumstances of the publication, the words used and the context may all have an effect on the imputation conveyed to the reader. Balkin and Davis stated at p 558:\\n Whether statements which have a clearly disparaging meaning are to be found defamatory depends very much on the context in which they are made, and the audience to whom they are made. \\nThe words are taken to have their ordinary and natural meaning, which is that meaning that is reasonably understood by the ordinary reasonable reader using his or her knowledge and experience of human affairs.\\n\\n160 A person need not be referred to by name to be defamed. It is sufficient if some people, proved to have knowledge of extrinsic circumstances, might reasonably believe that the statement referred to him or her: see Balkin and Davis at 564-565. They added at 565:\\n Identification of the plaintiff as the person referred to may come from others' knowledge of extrinsic facts. Thus, a statement that an (unnamed) business college has misled the public as to the efficacy of its courses will be defamatory on proof that some readers thereof understood the statement to refer to a particular college. (References omitted.) \\nAn action for defamation will lie only where the matter is made known to someone other than the person claiming to be defamed.\",\"27\":\"161 At common law, it is a complete defence to show that the words complained of are true in substance and effect: see Howden v 'Truth' and 'Sportsman' Ltd [1937] HCA 74 ; (1937) 58 CLR 416 at 424-425 per Evatt J. At the relevant time, this defence was available in South Australia, Victoria, Western Australia and the Northern Territory: see Balkin and Davis, at p 574. In other jurisdictions, it had also to be shown that the publication of the imputation was for the public benefit or, in New South Wales, that it related to a matter of public interest: see Balkin and Davis, at p 574. The cross-respondents invoked these defences. They also invoked \\\"qualified privilege\\\" as a defence.
