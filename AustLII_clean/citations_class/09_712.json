Indeed, this is reinforced by the Federal Magistrate's observations, referred to at [45] above, about the appellant's attempts to mislead the Tribunal.\\n\\nIt follows that the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\\n I certify that the preceding sixty-one (61) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Jacobson. \\n \\n Associate:\\n \\n \\nDated: 2 July 2009\\n \\n The First Appellant appeared in person. \\n \\n \\n Counsel for the First Respondent: Mr J.

In that case, an informant's letter was adverse to the applicant and contained information that was \\\"credible, relevant and significant\\\". Here, the equivocation about Mr Liu's involvement was not of that character. The information that was adverse was that Mr Liu had been held legally responsible for supply false certificates. The appellant was given full opportunity to deal with this.\",\"2\":\"In any event, the information in the email that it was not clear whether Mr Liu was implicated, was not \\\"adverse\\\" information within the test stated by Brennan J in Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550 at 628-629.\",\"3\":\"In SZKLG v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCAFC 198 ; (2007) 164 FCR 578 at [33] , a Full Court drew attention to the word \\\"considers\\\" in s 424A(1). Their Honours said that the effect of this is that s 424A(1) is only enlivened where the Tribunal forms the opinion that particular information would be the reason or part of the reason for affirming the decision under review. In MZXQB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 319 ; (2008) 166 FCR 483 at [27] , Heerey J described the test as one of \\\"dispositive relevance\\\".\",\"4\":\"The question of whether s 424A(1) was engaged is to be determined in advance, and independently of the Tribunal's reasoning on the facts of the particular case; the need for \\\"unbundling\\\" of the Tribunal's reasons is \\\"correspondingly reduced\\\": SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 ; (2007) 235 ALR 609 at [17] , [22].\",\"5\":\"In SZKLG v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCAFC 198 ; (2007) 164 FCR 578 at [33] , a Full Court drew attention to the word \\\"considers\\\" in s 424A(1).

This is because the Full Court held at [16]-[18] that s 422B(3) did not qualify the express statement in s 422B(1) that Div 4 contains an exhaustive statement of the requirements of the natural justice hearing rule in relation to the matters it deals with.\\n\\nAs the Full Court said in SZMOK , at [16], s 422B(3) is not a free standing obligation; it draws content from the other provisions of Div 4. It therefore cannot require s 424A to be interpreted as imposing an obligation not found to exist on the proper construction of that section. Here, there is nothing in s 424A which would have required the Tribunal to provide the full text of the email that was supplied to it by the Chinese speaking staff member to the appellant.\"}}"
