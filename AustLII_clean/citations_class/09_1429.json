It is, however, properly characterised as an interpretation provision and does not of itself create a cause of action: Ting v Blanche [1993] FCA 524 ; (1993) 118 ALR 543 at 552. Section 51A provides as follows: \\n \\n Interpretation \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n (1) For the purposes of this Division, where a corporation makes a representation with respect to any future matter (including the doing of, or the refusing to do, any act) and the corporation does not have reasonable grounds for making the representation, the representation shall be taken to be misleading. \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n (2) For the purposes of the application of subsection (1) in relation to a proceeding concerning a representation made by a corporation with respect to any future matter, the corporation shall, unless it adduces evidence to the contrary, be deemed not to have had reasonable grounds for making the representation. \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n (3) Subsection (1) shall be deemed not to limit by implication the meaning of a reference in this Division to a misleading representation, a representation that is misleading in a material particular or conduct that is misleading or is likely or liable to mislead. \\n \\n\\n \\n In Ting , supra, Hill J observed of this provision:\\n \\n \\n The section is but an interpretation section; it does not of itself create a cause of action, nor define a norm of conduct.

What s 51A does, in a practical sense, in cases where it applies, is to cast the burden of proof upon the respondent corporation who has made a representation about a future matter to show that in making that representation it had reasonable grounds for so doing. In the language of Sheppard and Neaves JJ in Cummings v Lewis (1993) 113 ALR 285 ; ATPR (Digest) 46-103, s 51A is \\\"designed to facilitate proof\\\" (at ALR 294; ATPR 53 ,450). \\n \\n\\n \\nIn the present proceeding, the course pursued by the draftsman has been to expressly plead reliance upon s 51A where it has been considered appropriate to do so.

What s 51A does, in a practical sense, in cases where it applies, is to cast the burden of proof upon the respondent corporation who has made a representation about a future matter to show that in making that representation it had reasonable grounds for so doing.

To serve those documents in their present form would be to visit upon the respondent a proceeding in Australia involving a significant number of claims, with only a small number of those claims justifying the grant of leave for such service. Although technically the proceeding as a whole might fall within O 8 r 2 of the Federal Court Rules , because of the presence of the small number of claims, this is not enough to persuade me to exercise the discretion to permit service out of the jurisdiction in respect of the whole proceeding.
