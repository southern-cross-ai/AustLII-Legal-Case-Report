The authorities relating to the proper construction and effect of s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act were exhaustively reviewed by Rares J in Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 at [31] [48]. His Honour stated the relevant principles at [45] and they may be summarised as follows:\\n \\n \\u2022 In assessing whether there are reasonable prospects of success, the Court must be cautious not to do an injustice by summary dismissal.\\n \\u2022 There will be reasonable prospects of success if there is evidence which may be reasonably believed so as to enable the party against whom summary judgment is sought to succeed at the final hearing.\\n \\u2022 Evidence of an ambivalent character will usually be sufficient to amount to reasonable prospects.\\n \\u2022 Unless only one conclusion can be said to be reasonable, the discretion under s 31A cannot be enlivened.\\n\\n31 I do not think that this approach conflicts with the provisions of s 31A(3).\\n\\n32 It is true that summary dismissal applications are to be determined on the pleadings and any evidence before the Court; but at the heart of the exercise is the assessment on incomplete materials, of the prospects of success if the matter proceeds to a final hearing; Boston Commercial at [38], [48].\\n\\n33 It would be wrong to determine the application on a narrow approach to the pleadings where, as here, there is evidence, albeit incomplete, and perhaps at this early stage, ambivalent, which may at a final hearing, and with amended pleadings, produce a verdict for the applicant.\",\"1\":\"50 The knowledge which is required to give rise to a claim of accessory liability is actual knowledge.

The report was prepared for a building society that supplied a copy of the report to the purchasers of the property, omitting all reference to the name of the employee signatory and his firm.\\n\\n36 The majority Justices, May LJ and Wilson J, held that the employee owed a duty of care to the purchasers. What underlies their observations at [44] and [61] are the concepts of assumption of responsibility and known reliance.\\n\\n37 The facts deposed to by Mr Ewing in [2], [5] and [6] give rise to an arguable case in accordance with this principle.\",\"3\":\"38 The decision of the High Court in O'Brien v Dawson [1942] HCA 8 ; (1942) 66 CLR 18 at 32 33 does not appear to have any application to the principles which underlie the modern development of the law of negligence. O'Brien v Dawson stands for the proposition that, ordinarily, the acts of a director will be the company's acts, not those of the director; thus the director cannot, without more, induce the company to breach a contract or conspire with it to do so. But this does not address the considerations which underlie the law of negligence.\\n\\n39 The claim to strike out the cross-claim based upon the provisions of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act must fail. This is because it is dependent upon the establishment of a duty of care on the part of Mr McDonald. I have held that there is an arguable claim that Mr McDonald was under such a duty.\\n\\n40 The second aspect of the cross-claim is more problematical. Indeed, in my view, it cannot go to trial.\",\"4\":\"50 The knowledge which is required to give rise to a claim of accessory liability is actual knowledge.

See also Richardson & Wrench (Holdings) Pty Ltd v Ligon No 174 Pty Ltd (1994) 123 ALR 681 at 693.\",\"5\":\"17 The other basis on which the cross-claim is attacked is that it claims accessory liability under s 75B of the Trade Practices Act without satisfying the requirements of knowledge of the falsity of the representation which is said to underpin the claims. Thus, it is said that this aspect of the cross-claim cannot establish the necessary ingredients of the cause of action as stated by the High Court in Yorke v Lucas [1985] HCA 65 ; (1985) 158 CLR 661.\\n\\n18 The evidence included a copy of the Valuation bearing the signature of Mr Ewing and the description of Mr McDonald below the signature purportedly of Mr O'Boyle as I have described above.\\n\\n19 Mr McDonald's affidavit states in [5]:\\n \\n 'The signature appearing above my printed name is not mine. I did not sign the valuation report. I did not prepare the valuation report.'\\n\\n50 The knowledge which is required to give rise to a claim of accessory liability is actual knowledge.
