The Tribunal was in error on this point however as, for reasons given below, I have concluded that the Tribunal's ultimate conclusion was not affected by this error, nothing turns on it.\\n\\nThe real issue in the appeal is the meaning of the phrase 'nearest other premises' which occurs in both rule 6(b)(i) and 6 (b)(ii). In particular, the issue was whether the phrase had the same or different meaning in each subrule. Despite a cogent argument put by Mr Zipser, counsel for the applicant, I have concluded that the meaning of the phrase is determined by the context of the subrule in which it occurs and for that reason 'nearest other premises' has a different meaning in each subrule.\\n\\nIt would seem that the Minister's new determination yields a result consistent with the result that would flow from the applicant's interpretation but this does not seem to me to assist in the interpretation of the rules that apply to the current application. As indicated above, the rules under consideration here were implemented pursuant to the Third Community Pharmacy Agreement. The 2006 determination is made pursuant to the Fourth Community Pharmacy Agreement. The preamble to Part 4 of the Fourth Community Pharmacy Agreement notes that, in addition to correcting difficulties associated with the previous location rules, the amendments to the location rules contained in the agreement 'are intended to provide greater flexibility to respond to community need for pharmacy services and to improve access to pharmacy services'. In addition, the Fourth Community Pharmacy Agreement indicates several objectives of the Location Rules that are not evident in the Third Community Pharmacy Agreement for instance to ensure that 'all Australians have access to PBS medicines'. It seems clear that the Fourth Community Pharmacy Agreement has different objectives from the Third Agreement even if those objectives have evolved from those in the earlier Agreement. There is no basis on which to suggest that the later rules can be relied on to clarify the meaning of the earlier rules. In the circumstances the caution advocated by Gummow J in Interlego AG v Croner Trading Pty Ltd (1992) 39 FCR 348 at 382 is well advised.\\n\\nThe orders in this matter must be that the respondent's notice of contention is upheld, the application is dismissed and the applicant must bear the respondent's costs. \\n\\n\\n I certify that the preceding thirty-three (33) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Stone. \\n\\n\\n Associate:\\n\\nDated: 28 September 2006\\n\\n Counsel for the Applicant: B Zipser \\n \\n Solicitor for the Applicant: McCarthy Holzberger \\n \\n Counsel for the Respondent: R M Henderson \\n \\n Solicitor for the Respondent: Australian Government Solicitor \\n \\n Date of Hearing: 27 June 2006 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 28 September 2006 \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2006\\/1289.html\",\"1\":\"The respondent also referred to Murphy v Farmer [1988] HCA 31 ; (1988) 165 CLR 19 in connection with the weight that should be given to the principle referred to in [8]. In Murphy the appellant had submitted that there was a presumption that the word 'false' should mean the same thing in s 229 of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) as it did in s 234 of that Act. The majority held (at 27): \\n \\n 'Plainly, there is some force in that argument. On the other hand, as Gibbs J. commented in Clyne v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation, the presumption that a word is used with a uniform meaning in a statute is not one \\\"of very much weight... it all depends on the context\\\". In the same case, Mason J. pointed out that the \\\"presumption readily yields to the context\\\".' \\n (footnotes omitted)\\n\\nIn the circumstances it is appropriate to consider the history of the rules and the policy that they were intended to promote.\",\"2\":\"In support of its construction of rule 6 the respondent referred to Pharmacy Guild of Australia v Australian Community Pharmacy Authority (1996) 70 FCR 462 and a decision of Deputy President McMahon of the Administrative Appeal Tribunal in Re Levis and Australian Community Pharmacy Authority (1998) 51 ALD 757. Both of these cases were concerned with earlier versions of the rules than those presently under consideration.\\n\\nThe rules considered by Branson J in the Pharmacy Guild case were made by a determination under s 99L of the Act on 2 May 1995 and were set out in her Honour's reasons at 465-466 as follows: \\n \\n \\n '3. For the purposes of paragraph 99K(1)(b) of the Act, the rules with which the Authority must comply in making a recommendation on an application by a pharmacist for approval under s 90 of the Act in respect of particular premises are set out in paragraphs 4 to 9. \\n 4. Approval of a pharmacist under section 90 of the Act in respect of particular premises must not be recommended except as provided for in paragraphs 5 to 8. \\n \\n \\n ... \\n \\n \\n 6 . ... approval of a pharmacist under section 90 of the Act in respect of particular premises must be recommended if the pharmacist is already approved under section 90 of the Act in respect of other premises from which the pharmacist proposes to cease supplying pharmaceutical benefits immediately before granting the approval if: \\n ... \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n (c) the premises in respect of which approval is sought are not less than two kilometres, measured door to door by the shortest lawful access route, from the nearest other premises in respect of which a pharmacist is approved under s 90 of the Act ... '\\n\\nBranson J rejected the submission that these provisions required the decision maker to determine which were the 'nearest other premises' by a straight line measurement before establishing the measurement of the shortest lawful access route from those premises to the premises in respect of which approval was sought. Her Honour found no warrant for such an approach in the words of the provision and held that in relying on evidence as to which pharmacy in the vicinity of the proposed premises was the 'closest' the decision maker took into account an irrelevant consideration. Her Honour commented (at 478): \\n \\n 'The issue before it was not whether the Oyster Bay pharmacy was the closest relevant pharmacy to the [proposed premises] but whether the distance from the nearest other relevant premises measured door to door by the shortest lawful access route to the [proposed premises] was less than 2 kilometres.\\n\\nThe provisions considered in Re Levis were not relevantly different and Deputy President McMahon relied upon the decision in the Pharmacy Guild case in reaching a similar conclusion.\\n\\nI respectfully accept that the context of the phrase 'nearest other premises' justified Branson J's conclusion in the Pharmacy Guild , and that this meaning might coherently be adopted in respect of the present provisions. However, the present provisions are different from those considered by Branson J and the significance of that difference must be examined. Whereas previously the relevant rules used only one criterion to test distance from the nearest other premises, rule 6, in 6(b)(i) and 6(b)(ii) respectively, uses both the straight line measurement and the lawful access measurement. Accordingly, there is a competing principle to the principle of contextual analysis applied by Branson J namely the 'sound rule of construction' referred to in [8] above. The issue is which of the two competing principles should prevail?\",\"3\":\"In support of its construction of rule 6 the respondent referred to Pharmacy Guild of Australia v Australian Community Pharmacy Authority (1996) 70 FCR 462 and a decision of Deputy President McMahon of the Administrative Appeal Tribunal in Re Levis and Australian Community Pharmacy Authority (1998) 51 ALD 757. Both of these cases were concerned with earlier versions of the rules than those presently under consideration.\\n\\nThe provisions considered in Re Levis were not relevantly different and Deputy President McMahon relied upon the decision in the Pharmacy Guild case in reaching a similar conclusion.\",\"4\":\"Although I have reached the conclusion stated above, the starting point of my analysis (and the applicant's submissions) is the generally accepted principle that, unless there is a reason to conclude otherwise, such as an indication in the statute itself, 'it is a sound rule of construction to give the same meaning to the same words appearing in different parts of a statute'; Registrar of Titles (WA) v Franzon [1975] HCA 41 ; (1975) 132 CLR 611 at 618 per Mason J. If that principle were to be applied, the first step in the application of either subrule would be to identify the ' nearest other premises' in respect of which a pharmacist is approved under s 90 of the Act. On that basis the premises so identified would be the same whether one was applying subrule 6(b)(i) or 6(b)(ii).\\n\\nThe Act does not say how one is to determine which other premises is the 'nearest' and therefore, subject to other indications to the contrary, one would give the word its ordinary English meaning. In the subrules under consideration 'nearest' is used in respect of proximity or distance; it is the superlative form of the adjective, 'near' which, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, means 'to, within or at a short distance' or 'close to a place, thing or person in respect of space or time'. The 'nearest' other premises are the 'closest' other premises or those which are the shortest distance away.\\n\\nThe shortest distance between two places is colloquially referred to as being a 'beeline' or 'as the crow flies', meaning a direct route that has no obstacles and is roughly a straight line measurement. On this analysis, the nearest other premises to the proposed premises are not necessarily those that are the quickest to reach from the proposed premises. The statement that 'X pharmacy is the closest' (or nearest), but that it would be 'quicker to get to Y pharmacy' is immediately understandable as making that distinction.\",\"5\":\"The background to these rules was explained by Hill J in Smoker v Pharmacy Restructuring Authority (1994) 53 FCR 287. His Honour referred to an agreement made in 1990 between the Government and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia which was intended to reduce the number of pharmacies approved to supply pharmaceutical benefits. His Honour continued at 294: \\n \\n '... the Government ultimately accepted recommendations made to it that pharmacy numbers should be reduced by encouraging pharmacists to either amalgamate or close to reduce the number of inefficient pharmacies and to strengthen the more viable pharmacies that remained. Provision was to be made for closure payments and, where an amalgamation or closure payment was made, no new approval in respect of the premises was to be granted unless certain approval criteria were met.'\\n\\nThe subsequent development of this policy through two subsequent agreements and the change in emphasis from 'a preoccupation with concentration of pharmacies in a particular locality ... to a desire to introduce more competition between pharmacies' was referred to in the AAT decision under review. The Third Community Pharmacy Agreement, made in 2000, refers in clause 21(d) to a purpose in amending the rules governing pharmacy relocations as being \\\"to enhance competition consistent with the maintenance of a viable and well distributed community pharmacy network\\\".\\n\\nI do not accept that the applicant's interpretation interpolates into rule 6 an unarticulated criterion for determining which premises are the nearest. In my view the reasons for interpreting 'nearest other premises' as set out in [8]-[10] are coherent and acceptable subject to there being indications in the statute or otherwise that a different meaning was intended. In addition, I do not accept that the applicant's interpretation defeats the purpose of having the two subrules with their different modes of measurement. On the applicant's interpretation once the 'nearest' premises have been identified, if the straight line measurement is at least 1.5 kilometres then the application must be approved. If, however, that measurement is less than 1.5 kilometres then the distance from the proposed premises by lawful access measurement must be determined. If that distance is 2 kilometres or more then a positive recommendation must be made under rule 6(b)(ii). For instance, using a common example, assume pharmacy A is only 500 metres by straight line measurement from the proposed premises but is directly across a river so that the shortest means of lawful access is across a bridge some 3 kilometres downstream. In that example the criterion in subrule 6(b)(ii) would be met and a positive recommendation made even though subrule 6(b)(i) has not been met.\"}}"
