The parties are fierce trade rivals, and understandably concerned to protect their commercial interests. The Court should not be too ready to dictate in hindsight a particular course of conduct which the parties could or should have taken.\\n\\n7 I think the applicant acted reasonably in initiating proceedings to forestall what was arguably, in its view, misleading and deceptive conduct by the respondent which could be seriously damaging. The respondent, on the other hand, proffered firm assurances which would meet the applicant's concerns. As events have turned out, those assurances have been substantiated. It is possible that the respondent might have offered more corroborating detail in its letter of today's date. However, that was a matter for judgment which had to be made quickly and under pressure. Given its legitimate concern about confidentiality of dealings with the Therapeutic Goods Administration, I do not think that the respondent acted unreasonably, although it might have acted differently.\\n\\n8 In the circumstances, I do not propose to make any order as to costs. The substantive application will be dismissed. \\n\\n I certify that the preceding eight (8) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Heerey. \\n\\n Associate:\\n\\nDated: 30 November 2006\\n\\n Counsel for the Applicant: D Shavin QC and I Horak \\n \\n Solicitors for the Applicant: Clayton Utz \\n \\n Counsel for the Respondent: S McVicar \\n \\n Solicitors for the Respondent: Freehills \\n \\n Date of Hearing: 30 November 2006 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 30 November 2006 \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2006\\/1763.html\"}}"
