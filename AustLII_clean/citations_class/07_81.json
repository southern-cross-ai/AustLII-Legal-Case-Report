I have not been able to find any Anglo-Australian authority on point but I did come across a decision of the New York Court of Common Pleas that is in point. The case is Bassett v French 64 NY St Rep 292 (1895). The action was for damages for wrongful dismissal. As regards the assessment of damages Pryor J said of the plaintiff:\\n \\n \\\"He was bound only to reasonable diligence in quest of other employment, and the proof is that he fulfilled the obligation. Having credited the defendant with every dollar he actually received, he is not responsible for money he earned but could not collect.\\\" [citations omitted]\\n\\n31 Although consultancy fees were credited to Mr Hem's account in the books of SSSA, the fees were not paid, the company is no longer in business, and it is unlikely to have assets to discharge the debt. At least Mr Cant, on whom the onus falls, has not shown otherwise. Thus, there will therefore be no deduction from the claim.\\n\\n32 The appeal will be allowed and Mr Cant will be directed to admit Mr Hem's proof for $75,000. On the question of costs, I think that Mr Hem should have them on a solicitor and client basis save for the costs incurred on 3 October 2006. Not only was Mr Hem successful on the appeal, on the evidence available to Mr Cant he had no basis for rejecting the proof. I have excluded the costs of 3 October 2006 because they were incurred when Mr Hem applied for and was granted leave to reopen his case and tender additional evidence. The costs of that day (also on a solicitor and client basis) should be borne by Mr Hem. \\n\\n I certify that the preceding thirty-two (32) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Finkelstein. \\n\\n\\n Associate:\\nDated: 9 February 2007\\n\\n\\n Counsel for the Plaintiff: Ms A Kaitinis \\n \\n Solicitor for the Plaintiff: John Curtain & Associates \\n \\n Counsel for the Defendant: Mr A Sandbach \\n \\n Solicitor for the Defendant: Lennon Settle Mazzeo Solicitors \\n \\n Date of Hearing: 2 and 3 October 2006 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 9 February 2007 \\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2007\\/81.html\",\"1\":\"21 As to the applicable principles I will refer to only two cases.

I rather think that something along those lines was suggested. Having accused him of theft it would not be surprising had Mr Coulson asked Mr Hem to resign. By the time of the conversation the ill-will between the two was significant. If Mr Hem had been asked to resign to avoid a dismissal that would be equivalent to an actual dismissal. In Sheffield Oxford Controls Co Ltd [1979] ICR 396, in delivering the judgment of the Employment Appeal Tribunal, Arnold J said (at 402): \\n \\n \\\"It is plain, we think, that there must exist a principle, exemplified by the four cases to which we have referred, that where an employee resigns and that resignation is determined upon him because he prefers to resign rather than be dismissed (the alternative having been expressed to him by the employer in the terms of a threat that if he does not resign he will be dismissed), the mechanics of the resignation do not cause that to be other than a dismissal. The cases do not in terms go further than that. We find the principle to be one of causation. In cases such as that which we have just hypothesised, and those reported, the causation is the threat. It is the existence of the threat which causes the employee to be willing to sign, and to sign, a resignation letter or be willing to give, and to give, the oral resignation. But where that willingness is brought about by other considerations and the actual causation of the resignation is no longer the threat which has been made but is the state of mind of the resigning employee, that he is willing and content to resign on the terms which he has negotiated and which are satisfactory to him, then we think there is no room for the principle to be derived from the decided cases.\\\"\\n\\n20 In the end it is not necessary for me to rule on any of the disputed aspects of the conversation between Mr Hem and Mr Coulson. The reason is that it is not in dispute that during the discussion Mr Hem was accused of being a thief. In the absence of any justification (and none was proffered) that accusation constitutes what in some cases is referred to as a \\\"constructive dismissal\\\".\",\"13\":\"22 The second case is Thomson v Orica Australia Pty Ltd (2002) 116 IR 186. In that case Allsop J described constructive dismissal in the following terms:\\n \\n \\\"Constructive dismissal is an unlawful termination of the contract of employment in circumstances where the employee leaves, without an express act or enunciation of 'dismissal' by the employer.
