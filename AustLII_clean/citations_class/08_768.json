The Honourable Federal Magistrates Court erred in interpreting the construction of s424A of the Migration Act 1958 ('the Act\\\"). 2. His Honour failed to determine that the purpose of s424A was not served in the proceeding of this applicant. 3. The Honourable Court also erred in law determining that the Refugee Review Tribunal (\\\"the Tribunal\\\") was in a breach of procedural fairness. 4. Additional details will be provided later. \\nNo \\\" Additional details \\\" have been provided. The Appellant appeared before this Court unrepresented, albeit with the assistance of an interpreter. He was unable to provide further clarification as to what was intended to be conveyed by the Grounds of Appeal .\\n\\n6 It is considered that the appeal should be dismissed.\\n\\n7 Section 424A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) provides as follows:\\n 424A Information and invitation given in writing by Tribunal (1) Subject to subsections (2A) and (3), the Tribunal must: (a) give to the applicant, in the way that the Tribunal considers appropriate in the circumstances, clear particulars of any information that the Tribunal considers would be the reason, or a part of the reason, for affirming the decision that is under review; and (b) ensure, as far as is reasonably practicable, that the applicant understands why it is relevant to the review, and the consequences of it being relied on in affirming the decision that is under review; and (c) invite the applicant to comment on or respond to it. (2) The information and invitation must be given to the applicant: (a) except where paragraph (b) applies--by one of the methods specified in section 441A ; or (b) if the applicant is in immigration detention--by a method prescribed for the purposes of giving documents to such a person. (2A) The Tribunal is not obliged under this section to give particulars of information to an applicant, nor invite the applicant to comment on or respond to the information, if the Tribunal gives clear particulars of the information to the applicant, and invites the applicant to comment on or respond to the information, under section 424AA. (3) This section does not apply to information: (a) that is not specifically about the applicant or another person and is just about a class of persons of which the applicant or other person is a member; or (b) that the applicant gave for the purpose of the application for review ; or (ba) that the applicant gave during the process that led to the decision that is under review, other than such information that was provided orally by the applicant to the Department; or (c) that is non disclosable information.\"}}"
