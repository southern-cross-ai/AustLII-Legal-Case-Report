In the light of this, and having regard to my earlier reasons in this matter, I consider that the words \\\" under or by reference to \\\" proposed by Brother are too extensive in their reach because they are capable of including conduct beyond that in respect of which specific findings have been made.\\n\\n13 I therefore consider that the orders proposed by Brother are appropriate, with the exception of proposed order 3, for which Dynamic Supplies' proposed order 3 should be substituted.\\n\\n14 In relation to the question of costs of this application relating to the form of orders, I note there have clearly been constructive discussions between the parties in relation to the form of the proposed orders. I therefore consider there should be no order as to costs.\",\"3\":\"5 In support of this submission, Dynamic Supplies referred to the recent decision in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dataline.Net.Au Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 146.
