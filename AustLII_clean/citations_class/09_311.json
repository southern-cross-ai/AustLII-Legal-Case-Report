"{\"id\":{\"0\":\"c0\"},\"class\":{\"0\":\"related\"},\"tocase\":{\"0\":\"Resort Huntervalley Pty Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2009] FCA 301\"},\"text\":{\"0\":\"In the face of what I was told yesterday, I released the respondent from the undertaking which he had given on 13 March 2009 (see Resort Huntervalley Pty Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2009] FCA 301).\\n\\nThe matter was again listed before me this morning. When the matter was called on, I was informed by the legal representatives for the parties that the respondent sought an order that the Application be summarily dismissed pursuant to s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) and that the respondent also sought a further order that the applicants pay the respondent's costs as agreed, or failing agreement, as taxed. I was handed a document which bears the signature of the solicitor for the first and second applicants and the signature of an authorised officer of the respondent. I was also told that the respondent relied upon O 20 r 5 of the Federal Court Rules in support of his application. That rule is in the following terms: \\n 5 Stay or dismissal (proceedings commenced on or after 1 December 2005) \\n\\n(1) This rule applies to a proceeding commenced on or after 1 December 2005 if the Court is satisfied that, for the proceeding generally or for a claim for relief in the proceeding:\\n \\n(a) the proceeding or claim is frivolous or vexatious; or\\n \\n(b) the proceeding or claim is an abuse of the process of the Court.\\n \\n(2) The Court may order that the proceeding be stayed or dismissed generally or in relation to the claim for relief.\\n \\n(3) The Court may receive evidence on the hearing of an application for an order under subrule (2).\\n \\nNote For a proceeding commenced on or after 1 December 2005 in which the prosecuting party has no reasonable prospect of success, see subsection 31A (2) of the Act.\\n\\nI have not been given a full explanation or, for that matter, much of an explanation as to what occurred on 13 March 2009 during the course of that day and before the undertakings were given on that day. Nor, indeed, have I been given any explanation of what has subsequently occurred insofar as the assets of the applicants are concerned.\"}}"
