A person does not qualify merely because he or she feels aggrieved by the conduct. He or she, in the judgment of the Court, must, in truth, be aggrieved by that conduct ( Cameron v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission 46 FCR at 515) and not merely have an intellectual or emotional concern in the subject matter of the proceedings ( Australian Conservation Foundation 146 CLR at 547-548). The words do not include \\\"a mere busybody who is interfering in things which do not concern him: but they do include a person who has a genuine grievance because an order has been made which prejudicially affects his interests\\\": Attorney-General (Gambia) v N'Jie [1961] AC 617 at 634, Gibbs CJ in Koowarta v Bjelke-Petersen [1982] HCA 27 ; (1982) 153 CLR 168 at 185. It is not sufficient that a person voices a particular concern and regards the actions of another as injurious to the object of that concern (Stephen J in Australian Conservation Foundation 146 CLR at 539, Gibbs CJ in Onus v Alcoa of Australia 149 CLR at 37).\\n\\n44 Fifth, traditionally the term \\\"person aggrieved\\\" should not be interpreted narrowly: N'Jie [1961] AC at 634 , Koowarta 153 CLR at 185, Tooheys Ltd v Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (1981) 54 FLR 421 at 437; Ogle v Strickland (1987) 13 FCR 306 (especially Fisher J at 307-308 and Lockhart J at 314-315). Further, as Gibbs CJ said in Onus v Alcoa of Australia Ltd 149 CLR at 36 in relation to whether a person has a \\\"special interest\\\" sufficient to sustain litigation,\\n \\n The rule is obviously a flexible one since, as was pointed out in [ Australian Conservation Foundation ], the question what is a sufficient interest will vary according to the nature of the subject matter of the litigation.\",\"6\":\"23 The traditional approach to standing in matters involving the enforcement of statutes was that while interference with private rights could be asserted by individuals, public rights could only be asserted by the Attorney-General representing the public, either in the name of the Attorney or at the relation of some complainant: Boyce v Paddington Borough Council [1903] 1 Ch 109, Gouriet v Attorney-General [1977] UKHL 5 ; [1978] AC 435; Australian Conservation Foundation Inc v Commonwealth [1979] HCA 1 ; (1980) 146 CLR 493, Davis v Commonwealth [1986] HCA 66 ; (1986) 68 ALR 18 per Gibbs CJ at 35-36; Bateman's Bay Local Aboriginal Land Council v The Aboriginal Community Benefit Fund Pty Ltd [1998] HCA 49 ; (1998) 194 CLR 247 at 261. As observed by Mason J in Australian Conservation Foundation 146 CLR at 547-8:\\n \\n Depending on the nature of the relief which he seeks, a plaintiff will in general have a locus standi when he can show actual or apprehended injury or damage to his property or proprietary rights, to his business or economic interests...and perhaps to his social or political interests. Beyond making this general observation, I consider that there is nothing to be gained from discussing in the abstract the broad range of interests which may serve to support a locus standi for, as I said in Robinson v Western Australian Museum [1977] HCA 46 ; (1977) 138 CLR 283 at 327-328: \\\"The cases are infinitely various and so much depends in a given case on the nature of the relief which is sought, for what is a sufficient interest in one case may be less than sufficient in another\\\".\\n\\n24 Defining private rights for this purpose is a distinct challenge (note Heydon JD \\\"Injunctions and Declarations\\\" in Stein LA (ed) Locus Standi (Law Book Company, 1979) at 38-39). Traditionally they have included proprietary and financial interests (Davies J in Alphapharm Pty Ltd v Smithkline Beecham (Australia) Pty Ltd (1994) 49 FCR 250 at 259, Nicholson J in Allan v Development Allowance Authority (1998) 80 FCR 583 at 598).

(A useful summary of cases, and difficulties of application of relevant principles, as existed at the time can be found in Heydon in Stein (1979) at 38-40, 45-54.)\\n\\n25 Further, it is clear that legislation may create personal statutory rights which can be enforced by an individual in a Court of law: Wool Sliping and Scouring Co Ltd v Central Wool Committee [1920] HCA 21 ; (1920) 28 CLR 51 per Knox CJ at 61-62; Grand Central Car Park Pty Ltd v Tivoli Freeholders [1969] VR 62 at 76; SS Constructions Pty Ltd v Ventura Motors Pty Ltd [1964] VR 229 at 246, Dajon Investments Pty Ltd v Talbot [1969] VR 603 at 613, Australian Conservation Foundation 146 CLR at 537, 542-544; Re East, ex parte Nguyen [1998] HCA 73 ; (1998) 196 CLR 354. As Stephen J observed in Australian Conservation Foundation 146 CLR at 541, referring to s 52 Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth):\\n \\n statutes may of course confer standing in express terms...they may also do so by conferring some right the denial of the enjoyment of which gives standing to sue to complain of that denial. Although that very denial might be thought to qualify as the suffering of special damage such as that of which Buckley J spoke, it is, perhaps, preferable in such a case to resolve the question of standing by the direct route of a search for enforceable rights conferred by statute, rather than follow the circuitous course of seeking, in accordance with Boyce's Case, for the existence of special damage. (cf Gibbs J at 532)\\n\\n27 The respondent made written submissions to the following effect:\\n \\na. the applicant is doing nothing other than attempting to enforce the public law as enacted by the provisions of the DD Act and the Disability Standards\\n \\nb. there is no right subsisting for the benefit of the applicant or its members personally that is sought to be asserted through this litigation\\n \\nc. the application by the applicant is one to assert the effect of the public law of the Commonwealth and the applicant therefore faces the difficulty in relation to standing as the application is a bare attempt to assert a public right or duty: Australian Conservation Foundation [1979] HCA 1 ; 146 CLR 493. The applicant has no special interest or private right asserted by the litigation, and there is no statutory basis providing standing in respect of the complaint: Truth About Motorways Pty Ltd v Macquarie Infrastructure Management Ltd [2000] HCA 11 ; (1999) 200 CLR 591\\n \\nd. no relator action is brought in the name of the Attorney-General at the applicant's request that such proceeding be undertaken: Farley & Lewers Ltd v AG [1963] NSWR 1624\\n \\ne. this is not a case where the interference with a public right is such that the applicant suffers special damage peculiar to itself from the interference: Boyce [1903] 1 Ch 109\\n \\nf. the applicant does not have standing to bring the prosecution. Accordingly, the complaint does not disclose a reasonable cause of action and should be struck out: Australian Conservation Foundation [1979] HCA 1 ; 146 CLR 493.\\n\\n28 The applicant submitted in summary:\\n \\na. the issue of standing to commence an action under the HREOC Act or the DD Act is to be determined on the proper construction of those Acts, not by reference to provisions of other enactments or common law principles: Stephenson v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (1996) 68 FCR 290\\n \\nb. given that the legislation is for the benefit of a burdened class of the public, in the event of ambiguity the legislation should receive a beneficial interpretation: Cooper v Human Rights & Equal Opportunity Commission [1999] FCA 180 ; (1999) 93 FCR 481\\n \\nc. contravention of a standard may be cause for complaint under s 32 DD Act \\n \\nd. section 46P(2) HREOC Act defines who may lodge a complaint under the HREOC Act. The section contemplates a complaint by an \\\"aggrieved person\\\" on the basis of \\\"alleged unlawful discrimination\\\"\\n \\ne. the provisions of the HREOC Act and the DD Act make it plain that they confer private rights with respect to \\\"unlawful discrimination\\\" as defined in s 3 HREOC Act\\n \\nf. the proceedings in the Court involve a determination of the allegations of unlawful discrimination as set out in the complaint, and are circumscribed by the complaint which was terminated by the President\\n \\ng. the applicant's complaint concerns ss 31 and 32 DD Act , and the terms of the complaint and the proceedings before the Court raise the issue of a contravention of the Disability Standards\\n \\nh. the HREOC Act operates to allow complaints to be made about non-compliance with the Disability Standards. Section 46P(1) HREOC Act creates a private right to make a complaint based on s 32\\n \\ni. the material clearly identifies a dispute between the applicant and the respondent, namely the failure on the part of the respondent to comply with the Disability Standards\\n \\nj. Australian Conservation Foundation [1979] HCA 1 ; 146 CLR 493 is not relevant in this matter because the High Court found that the provisions of the relevant legislation in that case did not create private rights\\n \\nk. the approach taken by the High Court in Truth About Motorways [2000] HCA 11 ; 200 CLR 591 confirms that the provisions of the HREOC Act and the DD Act permit the applicant to proceed in this Court.\\n\\n30 In this case, the respondent has drawn an analogy between the applicant's claim and the difficulties faced by the Foundation in Australian Conservation Foundation [1979] HCA 1 ; 146 CLR 493, which was found by the High Court to have no special interest or private right to sustain proceedings. In my view however the relevant legislation in Australian Conservation Foundation [1979] HCA 1 ; 146 CLR 493 was very different to that in this case. A key difference was summarised by Stephen J in Australian Conservation Foundation [1979] HCA 1 ; 146 CLR 493, where his Honour observed that, with reference to the relevant legislation and legislative instruments in that case,\\n \\n ...the subject matter of the [Environmental] Procedures is such as to suggest that the appellant has no standing to enforce compliance with them. They are not a code of procedure, such as is familiar in town planning legislation, designed to ensure that those who are likely to be affected by the grant of some permit or the rezoning of some land are given a right to object and to have their objection heard and determined . (at 544) (emphasis added) (cf Gibbs J at 532)\\n\\n41 Third, in order for a person to be \\\"aggrieved\\\" the test is objective, not subjective. A person does not qualify merely because he or she feels aggrieved by the conduct. He or she, in the judgment of the Court, must, in truth, be aggrieved by that conduct ( Cameron v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission 46 FCR at 515) and not merely have an intellectual or emotional concern in the subject matter of the proceedings ( Australian Conservation Foundation 146 CLR at 547-548).

It is not sufficient that a person voices a particular concern and regards the actions of another as injurious to the object of that concern (Stephen J in Australian Conservation Foundation 146 CLR at 539, Gibbs CJ in Onus v Alcoa of Australia 149 CLR at 37).\\n\\n44 Fifth, traditionally the term \\\"person aggrieved\\\" should not be interpreted narrowly: N'Jie [1961] AC at 634 , Koowarta 153 CLR at 185, Tooheys Ltd v Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (1981) 54 FLR 421 at 437; Ogle v Strickland (1987) 13 FCR 306 (especially Fisher J at 307-308 and Lockhart J at 314-315). Further, as Gibbs CJ said in Onus v Alcoa of Australia Ltd 149 CLR at 36 in relation to whether a person has a \\\"special interest\\\" sufficient to sustain litigation,\\n \\n The rule is obviously a flexible one since, as was pointed out in [ Australian Conservation Foundation ], the question what is a sufficient interest will vary according to the nature of the subject matter of the litigation.\\n\\n51 Eleventh, there are a number of cases where incorporated associations have sought to commence proceedings for breach of legislation in the environmental and human rights contexts. Traditionally, courts have tended to apply principles as to standing strictly and have frequently found that such organisations do not have an interest in the litigation, either because the association does not have a special interest in enforcing the relevant public right ( Australian Conservation Foundation [1979] HCA 1 ; 146 CLR 493, Central Queensland Speleological Society v Central Queensland Cement (No 1) [1989] 2 Qd R 512) or because the association is not a \\\"person aggrieved\\\" for the purposes of the relevant legislation ( Right To Life 50 FCR 56, Defence Coalition against RCD 74 FCR at 153). In a number of cases however the Court has held that the relevant association did have standing as a \\\"person aggrieved\\\" ( North Coast 127 ALR 617, Tasmanian Conservation Trust 127 ALR 580, National Trust of Australia [1976] VR 592, Manuka [1998] ACTSC 86). \\n Consideration and findings\\n\\n53 It is clear in this case that the complainant does have an intellectual or emotional concern in the subject matter of the proceedings. I accept that the purpose of the applicant is to ensure that all members of the Hervey Bay community have access to all premises and facilities in the region. However merely incorporating an association and giving voice to such objects is not sufficient to create standing, or to establish that the association is a \\\"person aggrieved\\\": Australian Conservation Foundation 146 CLR at 530, Right to Life 56 FCR at 67, 77.\\n\\n55 Before me, Mr Fleming on behalf of the respondent submitted that the applicant represented a general body of people, which might include people without a disability but with a genuine concern as to disability, and that this does not give the applicant a greater interest in the matter than anyone else. Mr Fleming cites Australian Conservation Foundation [1979] HCA 1 ; 146 CLR 493 in support of this submission. There is a distinction between the case before me and such cases as Australian Conservation Foundation [1979] HCA 1 ; 146 CLR 493, Right to Life 56 FCR 50, Speleological Society [1989] 2 Qd R 512 and Defence Coalition against RCD 74 FCR 142, namely that in each of those cases it was clear that the members of the association had no more interest in the proceedings - be they concerning the establishment of a resort in Central Queensland, abortion drugs, bat rookeries or rabbit calicivirus disease - than ordinary members of the public. In this case, it appears that the applicant was incorporated to represent people who have an interest in, inter alia , accessing public transport in the Hervey Bay region, and it further appears that it does represent some people who live in the Hervey Bay region and some people who are disabled and who may be aggrieved by non-compliance with the Disability Standards in that region. Potentially, for example, those members who are both disabled and live in the Hervey Bay region have an interest in these proceedings more than ordinary members of the public.\\n\\n60 Third, in any event I am not persuaded that the possible interests of the members of the applicant in this case are sufficient to distinguish this case from the general body of law represented by such cases as Australian Conservation Foundation [1979] HCA 1 ; 146 CLR 493, Right to Life 56 FCR 50, Speleological Society [1989] 2 Qd R 512 and Defence Coalition against RCD 74 FCR 142 . I note that the nature of the membership of the association was taken into consideration in Manuka [1998] ACTSC 86 where Higgins J held that the complainant had standing as an aggrieved person because each of its members would have a real interest in the subject matter of the decisions . However in this critical respect Manuka [1998] ACTSC 86 is immediately distinguishable from the case before me. The evidence here does not disclose how many of the members of the applicant are people with disabilities or who live in the Hervey Bay region, or both. It is quite possible - indeed likely given that the applicant contends that the majority of its members have an interest associated with the actions of the respondent - that some of its members are neither disabled nor live in the Hervey Bay region.\\n\\n63 Further, although of somewhat debatable significance (note comments of Lockhart J in Right to Life 56 FCR at 253), unlike in the North Coast 127 ALR 617, Tasmanian Conservation Trust 127 ALR 580 and National Trust of Australia (Vic) [1976] VR 592, there is no evidence before me that the applicant in this case is considered to be a peak body representing the interests of the disabled in the Hervey Bay region of Queensland, or that the applicant has been recognised by government as a body representing the concerns of the disabled in the Hervey Bay region of Queensland or had participated in official government decision-making processes. Further, while I note from correspondence attached to the affidavit of Mr Robin Andrew King sworn 8 November 2005 that the respondent has acknowledged the applicant's interest in bus shelter infrastructure in the region and sought the input of the applicant and its members (annexure RK 3), and that the Disability Standards require, inter alia , that a provider must consult with \\\"passengers with disabilities who use their service, or with organisations representing people with disabilities, about any proposal for equivalent access\\\" (cl 33.2 Disability Standards), it is difficult to characterise the conduct of the respondent as being anything more than a willingness to consult an organisation which was willing to provide information. In this sense, a comparison may be drawn with the consultation with the Foundation in Australian Conservation Foundation [1979] HCA 1 ; 146 CLR 493. Accordingly, I do not find comparisons with North Coast 127 ALR 617, Tasmanian Conservation Trust 127 ALR 580 or the National Trust of Australia (Vic) [1976] VR 592 cases of assistance in these proceedings.\",\"7\":\"23 The traditional approach to standing in matters involving the enforcement of statutes was that while interference with private rights could be asserted by individuals, public rights could only be asserted by the Attorney-General representing the public, either in the name of the Attorney or at the relation of some complainant: Boyce v Paddington Borough Council [1903] 1 Ch 109, Gouriet v Attorney-General [1977] UKHL 5 ; [1978] AC 435; Australian Conservation Foundation Inc v Commonwealth [1979] HCA 1 ; (1980) 146 CLR 493, Davis v Commonwealth [1986] HCA 66 ; (1986) 68 ALR 18 per Gibbs CJ at 35-36; Bateman's Bay Local Aboriginal Land Council v The Aboriginal Community Benefit Fund Pty Ltd [1998] HCA 49 ; (1998) 194 CLR 247 at 261.

Traditionally they have included proprietary and financial interests (Davies J in Alphapharm Pty Ltd v Smithkline Beecham (Australia) Pty Ltd (1994) 49 FCR 250 at 259, Nicholson J in Allan v Development Allowance Authority (1998) 80 FCR 583 at 598). The distinction between rights which are \\\"private rights\\\" enabling commencement of proceedings by way, for example, of declaratory and injunctive relief, and \\\"public rights\\\" the enforcement of which lay at the feet of the Attorney-General, has however blurred over time to permit individuals to bring proceedings where the individual suffers special damage peculiar to himself or herself from the interference with the public right: Boyce [1903] 1 Ch at 114. Although this principle has received recognition in Australian law note for example comments of Gavan Duffy CJ, Starke and Evatt JJ in Anderson v Commonwealth of Australia [1932] HCA 2 ; (1932) 47 CLR 50 at 52; Mason J in Robinson v Western Australian Museum (1977) 138 CLR 238 at 327; Australian Conservation Foundation 146 CLR per Gibbs J at 526-527, Stephen J at 537-538 and Mason J at 547; Onus v Alcoa of Australia Ltd [1981] HCA 50 ; (1981) 149 CLR 27 per Gibbs CJ at 35-36, Davis [1986] HCA 66 ; (1986) 68 ALR 18; Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Association v Minister for Industrial Affairs of the State of South Australia [1995] HCA 11 ; (1995) 183 CLR 552 at 558; Allan v Development Allowance Authority 80 FCR per Wilcox J at 586-87, Nicholson J at 598 giving effect to the principle raises difficulties in itself. (A useful summary of cases, and difficulties of application of relevant principles, as existed at the time can be found in Heydon in Stein (1979) at 38-40, 45-54.)\\n\\n27 The respondent made written submissions to the following effect:\\n \\na. the applicant is doing nothing other than attempting to enforce the public law as enacted by the provisions of the DD Act and the Disability Standards\\n \\nb. there is no right subsisting for the benefit of the applicant or its members personally that is sought to be asserted through this litigation\\n \\nc. the application by the applicant is one to assert the effect of the public law of the Commonwealth and the applicant therefore faces the difficulty in relation to standing as the application is a bare attempt to assert a public right or duty: Australian Conservation Foundation [1979] HCA 1 ; 146 CLR 493. The applicant has no special interest or private right asserted by the litigation, and there is no statutory basis providing standing in respect of the complaint: Truth About Motorways Pty Ltd v Macquarie Infrastructure Management Ltd [2000] HCA 11 ; (1999) 200 CLR 591\\n \\nd. no relator action is brought in the name of the Attorney-General at the applicant's request that such proceeding be undertaken: Farley & Lewers Ltd v AG [1963] NSWR 1624\\n \\ne. this is not a case where the interference with a public right is such that the applicant suffers special damage peculiar to itself from the interference: Boyce [1903] 1 Ch 109\\n \\nf. the applicant does not have standing to bring the prosecution. Accordingly, the complaint does not disclose a reasonable cause of action and should be struck out: Australian Conservation Foundation [1979] HCA 1 ; 146 CLR 493.\\n\\n42 Fourth, the respondent's submissions concerning this issue have substantially equated \\\"person aggrieved\\\" for the purposes of s 46P HREOC Act with principles articulated in Boyce [1903] 1 Ch 109 and the possession by a complainant of a special interest so as to enforce the public rights created by statute. Clearly, there is a different jurisprudential approach entailed by identifying whether rights created by statute are public rights permitting enforcement by an individual in circumstances only where the individual has a special interest, compared with considering legislation authorising a person aggrieved to enforce statutory rights created by the legislation. Nonetheless, it is certainly the case that Courts have explained the words \\\"person aggrieved\\\" in terms of special interest in the public law sense. So, for example, in Ricegrowers Co-operative Mills Ltd v Bannerman (1981) 56 FLR 443 at 447, Bowen CJ and Franki J said the words \\\"a person who is aggrieved\\\":\\n \\n ...are not to be confined to those who can establish that they have a legal interest at stake in the making of the decision. In our view they cover a person who can show a grievance which will be suffered as a result of the decision beyond that of an ordinary member of the public. (see Tooheys Ltd v Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (1981) 54 FLR 421 per Ellicott J)\\n (cf United States Tobacco Company v Minister for Consumer Affairs (1988) 20 FCR 520 at 527, Ogle v Strickland .)\",\"9\":\"32 The respondent submits further that as s 32 DD Act provides that contravention of disability standards is unlawful , public rights are created. However the fact that legislation provides that conduct is \\\"unlawful\\\" does not of itself mean that exclusively public rights of enforcement exist in relation to that legislation. There is an extensive body of law which provides that simply because a statute deems that certain actions are required by law, and failure to comply is unlawful even to the extent of prescribing a penalty, it does not mean that personal actions are therefore excluded (note for example comments of Atkin LJ in Phillips [1923] 2 KB 832; Groves v Lord Wimborne [1898] 2 QB 402 especially at 415-416; Britannic Merthyr Coal Company Ltd v David [1910] AC 74; Knox CJ, Isaacs, Gavan Duffy and Rich JJ in Mallinson v The Scottish Australian Investment Company Ltd [1920] HCA 51 ; (1920) 28 CLR 66 at 70-72; Potter v Ferguson [1979] 1 NSWLR 364 at 372; Toohey J in University of Newcastle v Chopra [1989] HCA 27 ; (1989) 85 ALR 321 at 343; Campbell v University of New South Wales (1992) 44 IR 56 at 68-69; Gooley v Westpac Banking Corporation (1995) 129 ALR 628 at 648; \\\"GS\\\" v News Ltd (1998) Aust Torts Reports 81-466 at 64,906). In all cases, notwithstanding the existence of other remedies (such as penalties), whether personal rights of action exist will depend on the construction of the statute itself.\",\"10\":\"31 In contrast, in the case before me the HREOC Act and the DD Act (including the Disability Standards formulated pursuant to s 31) provide a scheme which allows \\\"a person aggrieved\\\" by alleged unlawful discrimination - including, as I have already noted, conduct deemed unlawful by s 32 DD Act - to lodge a complaint with HREOC (s 46P HREOC Act); and in the event that the complaint is terminated, a person affected by the termination to make application to the Federal Court or the Federal Magistrates Court (s 46PO HREOC Act). Significantly, the HREOC Act also creates a specific structure sanctioning applications to the Court for remedies where the Court is satisfied that there has been unlawful discrimination, including payment of damages by the respondent, employment or re-employment an applicant, an order declaring that the respondent has committed unlawful discrimination and directing the respondent not to repeat or continue such unlawful discrimination as is sought in this case (s 46PO(4) HREOC Act). Indeed the point of the statutory scheme as constituted in this case by the HREOC Act and the DD Act is to make laws with respect to discriminatory conduct, and to allow those who are aggrieved by discriminatory conduct, personal rights to seek redress in respect of such conduct. To adopt the language of the majority of the High Court in Re East, ex parte Nguyen 196 CLR at 365, repeated in Western Australia v Ward [2002] HCA 28 ; (2002) 213 CLR 1 at 96,\\n \\n The elaborate and special scheme...was plainly intended by the Parliament to provide the means by which a person aggrieved by a contravention ... might obtain a remedy, and thus was regarded by Parliament as fulfilling Australia's treaty obligations, bearing always in mind the legal structure and system which formed the context in which the [legislation] was to operate.\\n \\n\\n(That those comments were in respect of the legislation as it stood prior to amendments, and the removal of provisions from the HREOC Act into the DD Act and other statutes, does not in any way minimise their relevance. As observed, in my view correctly, by Nicholson J in Bropho v State of Western Australia [2004] FCA 1209 at [26] - [29] and [51]-[52], they are equally applicable to the scheme as it presently exists.)\",\"11\":\"32 The respondent submits further that as s 32 DD Act provides that contravention of disability standards is unlawful , public rights are created. However the fact that legislation provides that conduct is \\\"unlawful\\\" does not of itself mean that exclusively public rights of enforcement exist in relation to that legislation. There is an extensive body of law which provides that simply because a statute deems that certain actions are required by law, and failure to comply is unlawful even to the extent of prescribing a penalty, it does not mean that personal actions are therefore excluded (note for example comments of Atkin LJ in Phillips [1923] 2 KB 832; Groves v Lord Wimborne [1898] 2 QB 402 especially at 415-416; Britannic Merthyr Coal Company Ltd v David [1910] AC 74; Knox CJ, Isaacs, Gavan Duffy and Rich JJ in Mallinson v The Scottish Australian Investment Company Ltd [1920] HCA 51 ; (1920) 28 CLR 66 at 70-72; Potter v Ferguson [1979] 1 NSWLR 364 at 372; Toohey J in University of Newcastle v Chopra [1989] HCA 27 ; (1989) 85 ALR 321 at 343; Campbell v University of New South Wales (1992) 44 IR 56 at 68-69; Gooley v Westpac Banking Corporation (1995) 129 ALR 628 at 648; \\\"GS\\\" v News Ltd (1998) Aust Torts Reports 81-466 at 64,906). In all cases, notwithstanding the existence of other remedies (such as penalties), whether personal rights of action exist will depend on the construction of the statute itself.\",\"12\":\"51 Eleventh, there are a number of cases where incorporated associations have sought to commence proceedings for breach of legislation in the environmental and human rights contexts. Traditionally, courts have tended to apply principles as to standing strictly and have frequently found that such organisations do not have an interest in the litigation, either because the association does not have a special interest in enforcing the relevant public right ( Australian Conservation Foundation [1979] HCA 1 ; 146 CLR 493, Central Queensland Speleological Society v Central Queensland Cement (No 1) [1989] 2 Qd R 512) or because the association is not a \\\"person aggrieved\\\" for the purposes of the relevant legislation ( Right To Life 50 FCR 56, Defence Coalition against RCD 74 FCR at 153). In a number of cases however the Court has held that the relevant association did have standing as a \\\"person aggrieved\\\" ( North Coast 127 ALR 617, Tasmanian Conservation Trust 127 ALR 580, National Trust of Australia [1976] VR 592, Manuka [1998] ACTSC 86). \\n Consideration and findings\\n\\n55 Before me, Mr Fleming on behalf of the respondent submitted that the applicant represented a general body of people, which might include people without a disability but with a genuine concern as to disability, and that this does not give the applicant a greater interest in the matter than anyone else. Mr Fleming cites Australian Conservation Foundation [1979] HCA 1 ; 146 CLR 493 in support of this submission. There is a distinction between the case before me and such cases as Australian Conservation Foundation [1979] HCA 1 ; 146 CLR 493, Right to Life 56 FCR 50, Speleological Society [1989] 2 Qd R 512 and Defence Coalition against RCD 74 FCR 142, namely that in each of those cases it was clear that the members of the association had no more interest in the proceedings - be they concerning the establishment of a resort in Central Queensland, abortion drugs, bat rookeries or rabbit calicivirus disease - than ordinary members of the public. In this case, it appears that the applicant was incorporated to represent people who have an interest in, inter alia , accessing public transport in the Hervey Bay region, and it further appears that it does represent some people who live in the Hervey Bay region and some people who are disabled and who may be aggrieved by non-compliance with the Disability Standards in that region. Potentially, for example, those members who are both disabled and live in the Hervey Bay region have an interest in these proceedings more than ordinary members of the public.\\n\\n60 Third, in any event I am not persuaded that the possible interests of the members of the applicant in this case are sufficient to distinguish this case from the general body of law represented by such cases as Australian Conservation Foundation [1979] HCA 1 ; 146 CLR 493, Right to Life 56 FCR 50, Speleological Society [1989] 2 Qd R 512 and Defence Coalition against RCD 74 FCR 142 . I note that the nature of the membership of the association was taken into consideration in Manuka [1998] ACTSC 86 where Higgins J held that the complainant had standing as an aggrieved person because each of its members would have a real interest in the subject matter of the decisions . However in this critical respect Manuka [1998] ACTSC 86 is immediately distinguishable from the case before me. The evidence here does not disclose how many of the members of the applicant are people with disabilities or who live in the Hervey Bay region, or both. It is quite possible - indeed likely given that the applicant contends that the majority of its members have an interest associated with the actions of the respondent - that some of its members are neither disabled nor live in the Hervey Bay region.\\n\\n66 However in this case the application currently before me specifically sought orders as to the standing of the applicant. Further, the applicant has not disputed the appropriateness of a determination of whether it is aggrieved in the context of the substantive proceedings. Indeed, the parties had the opportunity to put their cases on affidavit, and opportunity over the course of a hearing over one day to make their submissions. To adopt the language of de Jersey J in Speleological Society [1989] 2 Qd R at 535, there appears to be:\\n \\n no particular deficiency in the manner of the presentation of the evidence going to standing... There is, in short, no reason for thinking that given more time the (applicant) would mount a case on standing significantly different...\",\"13\":\"28 The applicant submitted in summary:\\n \\na. the issue of standing to commence an action under the HREOC Act or the DD Act is to be determined on the proper construction of those Acts, not by reference to provisions of other enactments or common law principles: Stephenson v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (1996) 68 FCR 290\\n \\nb. given that the legislation is for the benefit of a burdened class of the public, in the event of ambiguity the legislation should receive a beneficial interpretation: Cooper v Human Rights & Equal Opportunity Commission [1999] FCA 180 ; (1999) 93 FCR 481\\n \\nc. contravention of a standard may be cause for complaint under s 32 DD Act \\n \\nd. section 46P(2) HREOC Act defines who may lodge a complaint under the HREOC Act. The section contemplates a complaint by an \\\"aggrieved person\\\" on the basis of \\\"alleged unlawful discrimination\\\"\\n \\ne. the provisions of the HREOC Act and the DD Act make it plain that they confer private rights with respect to \\\"unlawful discrimination\\\" as defined in s 3 HREOC Act\\n \\nf. the proceedings in the Court involve a determination of the allegations of unlawful discrimination as set out in the complaint, and are circumscribed by the complaint which was terminated by the President\\n \\ng. the applicant's complaint concerns ss 31 and 32 DD Act , and the terms of the complaint and the proceedings before the Court raise the issue of a contravention of the Disability Standards\\n \\nh. the HREOC Act operates to allow complaints to be made about non-compliance with the Disability Standards. Section 46P(1) HREOC Act creates a private right to make a complaint based on s 32\\n \\ni. the material clearly identifies a dispute between the applicant and the respondent, namely the failure on the part of the respondent to comply with the Disability Standards\\n \\nj. Australian Conservation Foundation [1979] HCA 1 ; 146 CLR 493 is not relevant in this matter because the High Court found that the provisions of the relevant legislation in that case did not create private rights\\n \\nk. the approach taken by the High Court in Truth About Motorways [2000] HCA 11 ; 200 CLR 591 confirms that the provisions of the HREOC Act and the DD Act permit the applicant to proceed in this Court.\",\"14\":\"25 Further, it is clear that legislation may create personal statutory rights which can be enforced by an individual in a Court of law: Wool Sliping and Scouring Co Ltd v Central Wool Committee [1920] HCA 21 ; (1920) 28 CLR 51 per Knox CJ at 61-62; Grand Central Car Park Pty Ltd v Tivoli Freeholders [1969] VR 62 at 76; SS Constructions Pty Ltd v Ventura Motors Pty Ltd [1964] VR 229 at 246, Dajon Investments Pty Ltd v Talbot [1969] VR 603 at 613, Australian Conservation Foundation 146 CLR at 537, 542-544; Re East, ex parte Nguyen [1998] HCA 73 ; (1998) 196 CLR 354. As Stephen J observed in Australian Conservation Foundation 146 CLR at 541, referring to s 52 Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth):\\n \\n statutes may of course confer standing in express terms...they may also do so by conferring some right the denial of the enjoyment of which gives standing to sue to complain of that denial. Although that very denial might be thought to qualify as the suffering of special damage such as that of which Buckley J spoke, it is, perhaps, preferable in such a case to resolve the question of standing by the direct route of a search for enforceable rights conferred by statute, rather than follow the circuitous course of seeking, in accordance with Boyce's Case, for the existence of special damage. (cf Gibbs J at 532)\",\"15\":\"23 The traditional approach to standing in matters involving the enforcement of statutes was that while interference with private rights could be asserted by individuals, public rights could only be asserted by the Attorney-General representing the public, either in the name of the Attorney or at the relation of some complainant: Boyce v Paddington Borough Council [1903] 1 Ch 109, Gouriet v Attorney-General [1977] UKHL 5 ; [1978] AC 435; Australian Conservation Foundation Inc v Commonwealth [1979] HCA 1 ; (1980) 146 CLR 493, Davis v Commonwealth [1986] HCA 66 ; (1986) 68 ALR 18 per Gibbs CJ at 35-36; Bateman's Bay Local Aboriginal Land Council v The Aboriginal Community Benefit Fund Pty Ltd [1998] HCA 49 ; (1998) 194 CLR 247 at 261. As observed by Mason J in Australian Conservation Foundation 146 CLR at 547-8:\\n \\n Depending on the nature of the relief which he seeks, a plaintiff will in general have a locus standi when he can show actual or apprehended injury or damage to his property or proprietary rights, to his business or economic interests...and perhaps to his social or political interests. Beyond making this general observation, I consider that there is nothing to be gained from discussing in the abstract the broad range of interests which may serve to support a locus standi for, as I said in Robinson v Western Australian Museum [1977] HCA 46 ; (1977) 138 CLR 283 at 327-328: \\\"The cases are infinitely various and so much depends in a given case on the nature of the relief which is sought, for what is a sufficient interest in one case may be less than sufficient in another\\\".\\n\\n24 Defining private rights for this purpose is a distinct challenge (note Heydon JD \\\"Injunctions and Declarations\\\" in Stein LA (ed) Locus Standi (Law Book Company, 1979) at 38-39). Traditionally they have included proprietary and financial interests (Davies J in Alphapharm Pty Ltd v Smithkline Beecham (Australia) Pty Ltd (1994) 49 FCR 250 at 259, Nicholson J in Allan v Development Allowance Authority (1998) 80 FCR 583 at 598). The distinction between rights which are \\\"private rights\\\" enabling commencement of proceedings by way, for example, of declaratory and injunctive relief, and \\\"public rights\\\" the enforcement of which lay at the feet of the Attorney-General, has however blurred over time to permit individuals to bring proceedings where the individual suffers special damage peculiar to himself or herself from the interference with the public right: Boyce [1903] 1 Ch at 114. Although this principle has received recognition in Australian law note for example comments of Gavan Duffy CJ, Starke and Evatt JJ in Anderson v Commonwealth of Australia [1932] HCA 2 ; (1932) 47 CLR 50 at 52; Mason J in Robinson v Western Australian Museum (1977) 138 CLR 238 at 327; Australian Conservation Foundation 146 CLR per Gibbs J at 526-527, Stephen J at 537-538 and Mason J at 547; Onus v Alcoa of Australia Ltd [1981] HCA 50 ; (1981) 149 CLR 27 per Gibbs CJ at 35-36, Davis [1986] HCA 66 ; (1986) 68 ALR 18; Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Association v Minister for Industrial Affairs of the State of South Australia [1995] HCA 11 ; (1995) 183 CLR 552 at 558; Allan v Development Allowance Authority 80 FCR per Wilcox J at 586-87, Nicholson J at 598 giving effect to the principle raises difficulties in itself. (A useful summary of cases, and difficulties of application of relevant principles, as existed at the time can be found in Heydon in Stein (1979) at 38-40, 45-54.)\",\"16\":\"50 Tenth, to the extent that incorporated associations are bodies corporate which may sue or be sued in their own name, in assessing the interests of a body corporate the interests of its members are arguably irrelevant. So in Victorian Chamber of Manufactures v The Commonwealth [1943] HCA 19 ; (1943) 67 CLR 335 at 343 Starke J, without needing to decide the point, observed that an infringement of the rights of members of an incorporated body does of itself mean that the rights of the incorporated body are infringed, or that the incorporated body has standing to maintain an action (cf Lockhart J in Right to Life 56 FCR at 253 and Nicholson J in Defence Coalition against RCD Inc v Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (1997) 74 FCR 142). This may be distinguished from the position concerning unincorporated associations. A useful illustration of this point in this context is Scully 79 FCR 537, where an unincorporated association commenced proceedings under the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth) (in its then form), Wilcox J said:\\n \\n I agree with Commissioner Nettlefold that, as Executive Council for Australian Jewry is not a \\\"person\\\" in the eyes of the law, it is incapable of being a 'person aggrieved' within the meaning of s 22(1) of the Racial Discrimination Act . Therefore it is not itself a competent complainant. However, this does not mean its complaint is a nullity. It is necessary to go behind the name and consider whether the juristic persons who constitute the unincorporated association are 'persons aggrieved' by the allegedly unlawful act. If they are, the complaint is competent in law, though not in name, as it was made by them. (at 548)\\n\\n51 Eleventh, there are a number of cases where incorporated associations have sought to commence proceedings for breach of legislation in the environmental and human rights contexts. Traditionally, courts have tended to apply principles as to standing strictly and have frequently found that such organisations do not have an interest in the litigation, either because the association does not have a special interest in enforcing the relevant public right ( Australian Conservation Foundation [1979] HCA 1 ; 146 CLR 493, Central Queensland Speleological Society v Central Queensland Cement (No 1) [1989] 2 Qd R 512) or because the association is not a \\\"person aggrieved\\\" for the purposes of the relevant legislation ( Right To Life 50 FCR 56, Defence Coalition against RCD 74 FCR at 153). In a number of cases however the Court has held that the relevant association did have standing as a \\\"person aggrieved\\\" ( North Coast 127 ALR 617, Tasmanian Conservation Trust 127 ALR 580, National Trust of Australia [1976] VR 592, Manuka [1998] ACTSC 86). \\n Consideration and findings\\n\\n55 Before me, Mr Fleming on behalf of the respondent submitted that the applicant represented a general body of people, which might include people without a disability but with a genuine concern as to disability, and that this does not give the applicant a greater interest in the matter than anyone else. Mr Fleming cites Australian Conservation Foundation [1979] HCA 1 ; 146 CLR 493 in support of this submission. There is a distinction between the case before me and such cases as Australian Conservation Foundation [1979] HCA 1 ; 146 CLR 493, Right to Life 56 FCR 50, Speleological Society [1989] 2 Qd R 512 and Defence Coalition against RCD 74 FCR 142, namely that in each of those cases it was clear that the members of the association had no more interest in the proceedings - be they concerning the establishment of a resort in Central Queensland, abortion drugs, bat rookeries or rabbit calicivirus disease - than ordinary members of the public. In this case, it appears that the applicant was incorporated to represent people who have an interest in, inter alia , accessing public transport in the Hervey Bay region, and it further appears that it does represent some people who live in the Hervey Bay region and some people who are disabled and who may be aggrieved by non-compliance with the Disability Standards in that region. Potentially, for example, those members who are both disabled and live in the Hervey Bay region have an interest in these proceedings more than ordinary members of the public.\\n\\n59 Second, there is substantial body of authority, to which I have already referred, that the interests of members of a body corporate do not equate with the interests of the body corporate: Victorian Chamber of Manufactures [1943] HCA 19 ; 67 CLR 335, Right to Life 56 FCR 50, Defence Coalition against RCD 74 FCR 142.\\n\\n60 Third, in any event I am not persuaded that the possible interests of the members of the applicant in this case are sufficient to distinguish this case from the general body of law represented by such cases as Australian Conservation Foundation [1979] HCA 1 ; 146 CLR 493, Right to Life 56 FCR 50, Speleological Society [1989] 2 Qd R 512 and Defence Coalition against RCD 74 FCR 142 . I note that the nature of the membership of the association was taken into consideration in Manuka [1998] ACTSC 86 where Higgins J held that the complainant had standing as an aggrieved person because each of its members would have a real interest in the subject matter of the decisions . However in this critical respect Manuka [1998] ACTSC 86 is immediately distinguishable from the case before me. The evidence here does not disclose how many of the members of the applicant are people with disabilities or who live in the Hervey Bay region, or both. It is quite possible - indeed likely given that the applicant contends that the majority of its members have an interest associated with the actions of the respondent - that some of its members are neither disabled nor live in the Hervey Bay region.\",\"17\":\"14 The power to dismiss an application summarily must be exercised with great caution and only in the clearest of cases to ensure that an applicant is not deprived of its opportunity for trial of its case: Barwick CJ in General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 at 130. As Dixon J said in Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62 at 91:\\n \\n The principles upon which that jurisdiction is exercisable are well settled. A case must be very clear indeed to justify the summary intervention of the court to prevent a plaintiff submitting his case for determination in the appointed manner by the court with or without a jury. The fact that a transaction is intricate may not disentitle the court to examine a cause of action alleged to grow out of it for the purpose of seeing whether the proceeding amounts to an abuse of process or is vexatious. But once it appears that there is a real question to be determined whether of fact or law and that the rights of the parties depend upon it, then it is not competent for the court to dismiss the action as frivolous and vexatious and an abuse of process.\\n\\n67 I am mindful of the warnings given in such cases as General Steel Industries [1964] HCA 69 ; 112 CLR 125 and Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; 78 CLR 62 in relation to the power of the Court to dismiss an application summarily, and that it should be exercised with great caution. I am satisfied however in this case that it is appropriate to grant the orders sought by the respondents in the application currently before me. Notwithstanding its intellectual and emotional concern in the subject matter of the proceedings, the interest of the applicant is no more than that of an ordinary member of the public; the applicant is not affected to an extent greater than an ordinary member of the public, nor would the applicant gain an advantage if successful nor suffer a disadvantage if unsuccessful. To adopt the language of Lockhart J in Right to Life 56 FCR at 68:\\n \\n Wide and liberal though the laws of standing should be, the courts of this country have drawn the line of demarcation between an open system and the requirement of some form of interest in the subject matter of the proceeding other than a mere emotional attachment or intellectual pursuit or satisfaction.\",\"18\":\"35 Before me at the hearing, Mr Fleming QC made oral submissions as to whether the applicant, being an incorporated body, could be a person aggrieved by the complaints that have been made. In summary, Mr Fleming QC submitted:\\n \\na. cases where unincorporated associations have been accorded standing, for example Executive Council of Australian Jewry v Scully (1998) 79 FCR 537, have no application in this case because the applicant is an incorporated entity\\n \\nb. although the applicant is an association of people who have a genuine concern and interest in disability, this does not give them a greater interest in the matter than anyone else, and therefore does not make them \\\"aggrieved\\\"\\n \\nc. no specific act of discrimination is pleaded, and therefore there can be no person \\\"aggrieved\\\". For a person to be aggrieved the person must be prejudicially affected by an act\\n \\nd. the applicant, an incorporated body, cannot be a person aggrieved in this context because a corporation cannot be aggrieved by conduct with respect to bus stops unless the corporation was affected, for example, by a wrong to one of its employees, and that is not the case here.\\n\\n50 Tenth, to the extent that incorporated associations are bodies corporate which may sue or be sued in their own name, in assessing the interests of a body corporate the interests of its members are arguably irrelevant. So in Victorian Chamber of Manufactures v The Commonwealth [1943] HCA 19 ; (1943) 67 CLR 335 at 343 Starke J, without needing to decide the point, observed that an infringement of the rights of members of an incorporated body does of itself mean that the rights of the incorporated body are infringed, or that the incorporated body has standing to maintain an action (cf Lockhart J in Right to Life 56 FCR at 253 and Nicholson J in Defence Coalition against RCD Inc v Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (1997) 74 FCR 142). This may be distinguished from the position concerning unincorporated associations. A useful illustration of this point in this context is Scully 79 FCR 537, where an unincorporated association commenced proceedings under the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth) (in its then form), Wilcox J said:\\n \\n I agree with Commissioner Nettlefold that, as Executive Council for Australian Jewry is not a \\\"person\\\" in the eyes of the law, it is incapable of being a 'person aggrieved' within the meaning of s 22(1) of the Racial Discrimination Act . Therefore it is not itself a competent complainant. However, this does not mean its complaint is a nullity. It is necessary to go behind the name and consider whether the juristic persons who constitute the unincorporated association are 'persons aggrieved' by the allegedly unlawful act. If they are, the complaint is competent in law, though not in name, as it was made by them. (at 548)\\n\\n54 As the cases have shown, it is possible that a body corporate can be the subject of racial discrimination where the association is the subject of discrimination by reason of the race, colour or national or ethnic origin of any associate of that corporation: Scully 79 FCR 537 and Koowarta [1982] HCA 27 ; 153 CLR 168. Similar principles potentially apply in relation to a body corporate which claims discrimination as a result of conduct in breach of the DD Act . So, for example, if an incorporated association representing disabled people was refused a lease of accommodation because of the objects of the association and the attributes of its members, it is arguable that the association itself would be a \\\"person aggrieved\\\" by that conduct. However as Mr Fleming submitted, it is more difficult to establish that the applicant, an incorporated association, is a person aggrieved within the meaning of the HREOC Act and the DD Act where the applicant is complaining about a breach of disability standards associated with accessing public transport.\\n\\n56 I note that the applicant in its written submissions contended that the majority of its members are people with disabilities who are resident in the Maryborough and Hervey Bay areas of Queensland, and that those members have the requisite interest associated with the actions of the respondent in the provision of goods and services within the Hervey Bay areas. The applicant cited Scully in support of this submission.\\n\\n57 However to my mind the reference to Scully 79 FCR 537, and the relevance of the possible interests of the members of the applicant, can be answered as follows.\\n\\n58 First, in my view Scully 79 FCR 537 is of minimal assistance to the applicant. There is a clear and obvious distinction between unincorporated associations, as was the applicant in Scully 79 FCR 537, and incorporated associations such as the applicant. Whilst it is true that incorporated associations are community-based organisations and in many respects, as I have already noted, are not comparable with commercial companies operating for profit-making purposes, nonetheless it would be improper to ignore the status attributed to such associations by the Associations Incorporation Act 1981 (Qld). The applicant is body corporate which needs to establish that it is a person aggrieved in its own right. Unlike the applicant in Scully 79 FCR 537, it is not an unincorporated association which may derive a special interest or status of \\\"person aggrieved\\\" from its members.\",\"19\":\"27 The respondent made written submissions to the following effect:\\n \\na. the applicant is doing nothing other than attempting to enforce the public law as enacted by the provisions of the DD Act and the Disability Standards\\n \\nb. there is no right subsisting for the benefit of the applicant or its members personally that is sought to be asserted through this litigation\\n \\nc. the application by the applicant is one to assert the effect of the public law of the Commonwealth and the applicant therefore faces the difficulty in relation to standing as the application is a bare attempt to assert a public right or duty: Australian Conservation Foundation [1979] HCA 1 ; 146 CLR 493. The applicant has no special interest or private right asserted by the litigation, and there is no statutory basis providing standing in respect of the complaint: Truth About Motorways Pty Ltd v Macquarie Infrastructure Management Ltd [2000] HCA 11 ; (1999) 200 CLR 591\\n \\nd. no relator action is brought in the name of the Attorney-General at the applicant's request that such proceeding be undertaken: Farley & Lewers Ltd v AG [1963] NSWR 1624\\n \\ne. this is not a case where the interference with a public right is such that the applicant suffers special damage peculiar to itself from the interference: Boyce [1903] 1 Ch 109\\n \\nf. the applicant does not have standing to bring the prosecution. Accordingly, the complaint does not disclose a reasonable cause of action and should be struck out: Australian Conservation Foundation [1979] HCA 1 ; 146 CLR 493.\",\"20\":\"14 The power to dismiss an application summarily must be exercised with great caution and only in the clearest of cases to ensure that an applicant is not deprived of its opportunity for trial of its case: Barwick CJ in General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 at 130. As Dixon J said in Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62 at 91:\\n \\n The principles upon which that jurisdiction is exercisable are well settled.

However the fact that legislation provides that conduct is \\\"unlawful\\\" does not of itself mean that exclusively public rights of enforcement exist in relation to that legislation. There is an extensive body of law which provides that simply because a statute deems that certain actions are required by law, and failure to comply is unlawful even to the extent of prescribing a penalty, it does not mean that personal actions are therefore excluded (note for example comments of Atkin LJ in Phillips [1923] 2 KB 832; Groves v Lord Wimborne [1898] 2 QB 402 especially at 415-416; Britannic Merthyr Coal Company Ltd v David [1910] AC 74; Knox CJ, Isaacs, Gavan Duffy and Rich JJ in Mallinson v The Scottish Australian Investment Company Ltd [1920] HCA 51 ; (1920) 28 CLR 66 at 70-72; Potter v Ferguson [1979] 1 NSWLR 364 at 372; Toohey J in University of Newcastle v Chopra [1989] HCA 27 ; (1989) 85 ALR 321 at 343; Campbell v University of New South Wales (1992) 44 IR 56 at 68-69; Gooley v Westpac Banking Corporation (1995) 129 ALR 628 at 648; \\\"GS\\\" v News Ltd (1998) Aust Torts Reports 81-466 at 64,906). In all cases, notwithstanding the existence of other remedies (such as penalties), whether personal rights of action exist will depend on the construction of the statute itself.\",\"22\":\"23 The traditional approach to standing in matters involving the enforcement of statutes was that while interference with private rights could be asserted by individuals, public rights could only be asserted by the Attorney-General representing the public, either in the name of the Attorney or at the relation of some complainant: Boyce v Paddington Borough Council [1903] 1 Ch 109, Gouriet v Attorney-General [1977] UKHL 5 ; [1978] AC 435; Australian Conservation Foundation Inc v Commonwealth [1979] HCA 1 ; (1980) 146 CLR 493, Davis v Commonwealth [1986] HCA 66 ; (1986) 68 ALR 18 per Gibbs CJ at 35-36; Bateman's Bay Local Aboriginal Land Council v The Aboriginal Community Benefit Fund Pty Ltd [1998] HCA 49 ; (1998) 194 CLR 247 at 261. As observed by Mason J in Australian Conservation Foundation 146 CLR at 547-8:\\n \\n Depending on the nature of the relief which he seeks, a plaintiff will in general have a locus standi when he can show actual or apprehended injury or damage to his property or proprietary rights, to his business or economic interests...and perhaps to his social or political interests. Beyond making this general observation, I consider that there is nothing to be gained from discussing in the abstract the broad range of interests which may serve to support a locus standi for, as I said in Robinson v Western Australian Museum [1977] HCA 46 ; (1977) 138 CLR 283 at 327-328: \\\"The cases are infinitely various and so much depends in a given case on the nature of the relief which is sought, for what is a sufficient interest in one case may be less than sufficient in another\\\".\",\"23\":\"25 Further, it is clear that legislation may create personal statutory rights which can be enforced by an individual in a Court of law: Wool Sliping and Scouring Co Ltd v Central Wool Committee [1920] HCA 21 ; (1920) 28 CLR 51 per Knox CJ at 61-62; Grand Central Car Park Pty Ltd v Tivoli Freeholders [1969] VR 62 at 76; SS Constructions Pty Ltd v Ventura Motors Pty Ltd [1964] VR 229 at 246, Dajon Investments Pty Ltd v Talbot [1969] VR 603 at 613, Australian Conservation Foundation 146 CLR at 537, 542-544; Re East, ex parte Nguyen [1998] HCA 73 ; (1998) 196 CLR 354. As Stephen J observed in Australian Conservation Foundation 146 CLR at 541, referring to s 52 Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth):\\n \\n statutes may of course confer standing in express terms...they may also do so by conferring some right the denial of the enjoyment of which gives standing to sue to complain of that denial. Although that very denial might be thought to qualify as the suffering of special damage such as that of which Buckley J spoke, it is, perhaps, preferable in such a case to resolve the question of standing by the direct route of a search for enforceable rights conferred by statute, rather than follow the circuitous course of seeking, in accordance with Boyce's Case, for the existence of special damage. (cf Gibbs J at 532)\\n\\n26 Whether a statute confers upon individuals personal rights and standing to enforce those rights are matters to be determined on the construction of the statute, by reference to the subject, scope and purpose of that statute: Allan v Transurban City Link Ltd [2001] HCA 58 ; (2001) 208 CLR 167 at 174; cf McInerney J in Grand Central Car Park [1969] VR at 74, Kaye and Marks JJ in Thorne v Doug Wade Consultants Pty Ltd [1985] VR 433 at 486 and Atkin LJ in Phillips v Britannia Hygienic Laundry Co Ltd [1923] 2 KB 832 at 841.\\n This case\",\"24\":\"32 The respondent submits further that as s 32 DD Act provides that contravention of disability standards is unlawful , public rights are created.

In all cases, notwithstanding the existence of other remedies (such as penalties), whether personal rights of action exist will depend on the construction of the statute itself.\",\"26\":\"41 Third, in order for a person to be \\\"aggrieved\\\" the test is objective, not subjective. A person does not qualify merely because he or she feels aggrieved by the conduct. He or she, in the judgment of the Court, must, in truth, be aggrieved by that conduct ( Cameron v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission 46 FCR at 515) and not merely have an intellectual or emotional concern in the subject matter of the proceedings ( Australian Conservation Foundation 146 CLR at 547-548). The words do not include \\\"a mere busybody who is interfering in things which do not concern him: but they do include a person who has a genuine grievance because an order has been made which prejudicially affects his interests\\\": Attorney-General (Gambia) v N'Jie [1961] AC 617 at 634, Gibbs CJ in Koowarta v Bjelke-Petersen [1982] HCA 27 ; (1982) 153 CLR 168 at 185. It is not sufficient that a person voices a particular concern and regards the actions of another as injurious to the object of that concern (Stephen J in Australian Conservation Foundation 146 CLR at 539, Gibbs CJ in Onus v Alcoa of Australia 149 CLR at 37).\\n\\n43 The nature of the complainant's interest was expressed slightly differently by Gibbs CJ in Koowarta 153 CLR at 183 where his Honour said:\\n \\n The words \\\"person aggrieved\\\" have appeared in many statutes, English and Australian, and their meaning has been discussed in many cases. In the end of course the meaning of the words must depend on the context of the particular statute. It has often been said that the words connote a person with a legal grievance: see In Re Sidebotham (1880) 14 ChD 458 at 465; Buxton v Minister of Housing and Local Government (1961) 1 QB 278 at 285 .The cases under the Trade Marks Acts to which we were referred are consistent with that view; they suggest that a person is \\\"aggrieved\\\" by an act which operates in restraint of what would otherwise have been his legal rights: Powell v Birmingham Vinegar Brewery Co (1894) AC 8 at 10, 12; Attorney-General (NSW) v Brewery Employee's Union of NSW [1908] HCA 94 ; (1908) 6 CLR 469 at 497, 519, 550; Continental Liqueurs Pty Ltd v GF Heublein and Bro Inc [1960] HCA 37 ; (1960) 103 CLR 422 at 427... (I)n determining the meaning of the expression \\\"person aggrieved\\\" in s 24 of the Act it is necessary to have regard to the remedies which such a person may obtain under s 25. These include damages in respect of loss suffered by the person aggrieved by the relevant act and loss of dignity by, humiliation to, or injury to the feelings of, a person aggrieved by the relevant act. If the refusal of consent proves to have been unlawful, Mr Koowarta may be able to obtain damages of that kind. In all these circumstances it seems to me that he is a \\\"person aggrieved\\\" and entitled to maintain the proceedings.\\n\\n44 Fifth, traditionally the term \\\"person aggrieved\\\" should not be interpreted narrowly: N'Jie [1961] AC at 634 , Koowarta 153 CLR at 185, Tooheys Ltd v Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (1981) 54 FLR 421 at 437; Ogle v Strickland (1987) 13 FCR 306 (especially Fisher J at 307-308 and Lockhart J at 314-315). Further, as Gibbs CJ said in Onus v Alcoa of Australia Ltd 149 CLR at 36 in relation to whether a person has a \\\"special interest\\\" sufficient to sustain litigation,\\n \\n The rule is obviously a flexible one since, as was pointed out in [ Australian Conservation Foundation ], the question what is a sufficient interest will vary according to the nature of the subject matter of the litigation.\\n\\n46 Seventh, to the extent that the respondent submits that, as a general proposition, a body corporate cannot be an aggrieved person in the context of this scheme, I do not accept that submission. As noted by Mason J in Koowarta 153 CLR at 236 in considering the issue of standing under the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth) (in its then form):\\n \\n By virtue of s 22(a) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) a reference in a statute to a \\\"Person\\\" includes a reference to a body corporate, unless a contrary intention appears. It is submitted that because, generally speaking, human rights are accorded to individuals, not to corporations, \\\"person\\\" should be confined to individuals. But, the object of the Convention being to eliminate all forms of racial discrimination and the purpose of s 12 being to prohibit acts involving racial discrimination, there is a strong reason for giving the word its statutory sense so that the section applies to discrimination against a corporation by reason of the race, colour or national or ethnic origin of any associate of that corporation.\\n\\n54 As the cases have shown, it is possible that a body corporate can be the subject of racial discrimination where the association is the subject of discrimination by reason of the race, colour or national or ethnic origin of any associate of that corporation: Scully 79 FCR 537 and Koowarta [1982] HCA 27 ; 153 CLR 168. Similar principles potentially apply in relation to a body corporate which claims discrimination as a result of conduct in breach of the DD Act . So, for example, if an incorporated association representing disabled people was refused a lease of accommodation because of the objects of the association and the attributes of its members, it is arguable that the association itself would be a \\\"person aggrieved\\\" by that conduct. However as Mr Fleming submitted, it is more difficult to establish that the applicant, an incorporated association, is a person aggrieved within the meaning of the HREOC Act and the DD Act where the applicant is complaining about a breach of disability standards associated with accessing public transport.\",\"27\":\"32 The respondent submits further that as s 32 DD Act provides that contravention of disability standards is unlawful , public rights are created. However the fact that legislation provides that conduct is \\\"unlawful\\\" does not of itself mean that exclusively public rights of enforcement exist in relation to that legislation. There is an extensive body of law which provides that simply because a statute deems that certain actions are required by law, and failure to comply is unlawful even to the extent of prescribing a penalty, it does not mean that personal actions are therefore excluded (note for example comments of Atkin LJ in Phillips [1923] 2 KB 832; Groves v Lord Wimborne [1898] 2 QB 402 especially at 415-416; Britannic Merthyr Coal Company Ltd v David [1910] AC 74; Knox CJ, Isaacs, Gavan Duffy and Rich JJ in Mallinson v The Scottish Australian Investment Company Ltd [1920] HCA 51 ; (1920) 28 CLR 66 at 70-72; Potter v Ferguson [1979] 1 NSWLR 364 at 372; Toohey J in University of Newcastle v Chopra [1989] HCA 27 ; (1989) 85 ALR 321 at 343; Campbell v University of New South Wales (1992) 44 IR 56 at 68-69; Gooley v Westpac Banking Corporation (1995) 129 ALR 628 at 648; \\\"GS\\\" v News Ltd (1998) Aust Torts Reports 81-466 at 64,906). In all cases, notwithstanding the existence of other remedies (such as penalties), whether personal rights of action exist will depend on the construction of the statute itself.\",\"28\":\"47 I also note other cases where standing as \\\"aggrieved person\\\" has been recognised in relation to corporate bodies, including National Trust of Australia (Vic) v Australian Temperance and General Mutual Life Assurance Society Ltd [1976] VR 592, Tasmanian Conservation Trust Inc v Minister for Resources (1995) 127 ALR 580, North Coast Environment Council Inc v Minister for Resources (1994) 127 ALR 617 and Manuka Business Association Inc v The Australian Capital Territory Executive and Minister for the Environment, Land and Planning [1998] ACTSC 86.\\n\\n51 Eleventh, there are a number of cases where incorporated associations have sought to commence proceedings for breach of legislation in the environmental and human rights contexts. Traditionally, courts have tended to apply principles as to standing strictly and have frequently found that such organisations do not have an interest in the litigation, either because the association does not have a special interest in enforcing the relevant public right ( Australian Conservation Foundation [1979] HCA 1 ; 146 CLR 493, Central Queensland Speleological Society v Central Queensland Cement (No 1) [1989] 2 Qd R 512) or because the association is not a \\\"person aggrieved\\\" for the purposes of the relevant legislation ( Right To Life 50 FCR 56, Defence Coalition against RCD 74 FCR at 153). In a number of cases however the Court has held that the relevant association did have standing as a \\\"person aggrieved\\\" ( North Coast 127 ALR 617, Tasmanian Conservation Trust 127 ALR 580, National Trust of Australia [1976] VR 592, Manuka [1998] ACTSC 86). \\n Consideration and findings\\n\\n60 Third, in any event I am not persuaded that the possible interests of the members of the applicant in this case are sufficient to distinguish this case from the general body of law represented by such cases as Australian Conservation Foundation [1979] HCA 1 ; 146 CLR 493, Right to Life 56 FCR 50, Speleological Society [1989] 2 Qd R 512 and Defence Coalition against RCD 74 FCR 142 . I note that the nature of the membership of the association was taken into consideration in Manuka [1998] ACTSC 86 where Higgins J held that the complainant had standing as an aggrieved person because each of its members would have a real interest in the subject matter of the decisions . However in this critical respect Manuka [1998] ACTSC 86 is immediately distinguishable from the case before me. The evidence here does not disclose how many of the members of the applicant are people with disabilities or who live in the Hervey Bay region, or both. It is quite possible - indeed likely given that the applicant contends that the majority of its members have an interest associated with the actions of the respondent - that some of its members are neither disabled nor live in the Hervey Bay region.\\n\\n61 The decision in Manuka [1998] ACTSC 86 may be further contrasted with, for example, Onesteel Manufacturing Pty Ltd v Whyalla Red Dust Action Group Inc [2006] SASC 114 where Debelle J held that an association of 45 residents in the Whyalla area concerned with environmental issues involving the steel works operated by Onesteel [2006] SASC 114 was nonetheless not a \\\"person interested\\\" for the purposes of the relevant legislation because:\\n \\n It is unable to point to any physical injury or harm. It has no property which is affected by the subject matter of the application. It has no interests of its own which might be affected other than indirectly through those of its members who might be affected. The evidence does not disclose how many of its members are affected. All that is known is that some of its members live, work or own property affected by dust from OneSteel's plant. One possible corollary is that some of its members may not be affected at all. (at [30])\\n\\n62 Notwithstanding the different term in consideration in Manuka [1998] ACTSC 86 the language used by his Honour appears to be precisely applicable in the case before me.\",\"29\":\"47 I also note other cases where standing as \\\"aggrieved person\\\" has been recognised in relation to corporate bodies, including National Trust of Australia (Vic) v Australian Temperance and General Mutual Life Assurance Society Ltd [1976] VR 592, Tasmanian Conservation Trust Inc v Minister for Resources (1995) 127 ALR 580, North Coast Environment Council Inc v Minister for Resources (1994) 127 ALR 617 and Manuka Business Association Inc v The Australian Capital Territory Executive and Minister for the Environment, Land and Planning [1998] ACTSC 86.\\n\\n51 Eleventh, there are a number of cases where incorporated associations have sought to commence proceedings for breach of legislation in the environmental and human rights contexts.

In a number of cases however the Court has held that the relevant association did have standing as a \\\"person aggrieved\\\" ( North Coast 127 ALR 617, Tasmanian Conservation Trust 127 ALR 580, National Trust of Australia [1976] VR 592, Manuka [1998] ACTSC 86). \\n Consideration and findings\\n\\n63 Further, although of somewhat debatable significance (note comments of Lockhart J in Right to Life 56 FCR at 253), unlike in the North Coast 127 ALR 617, Tasmanian Conservation Trust 127 ALR 580 and National Trust of Australia (Vic) [1976] VR 592, there is no evidence before me that the applicant in this case is considered to be a peak body representing the interests of the disabled in the Hervey Bay region of Queensland, or that the applicant has been recognised by government as a body representing the concerns of the disabled in the Hervey Bay region of Queensland or had participated in official government decision-making processes. Further, while I note from correspondence attached to the affidavit of Mr Robin Andrew King sworn 8 November 2005 that the respondent has acknowledged the applicant's interest in bus shelter infrastructure in the region and sought the input of the applicant and its members (annexure RK 3), and that the Disability Standards require, inter alia , that a provider must consult with \\\"passengers with disabilities who use their service, or with organisations representing people with disabilities, about any proposal for equivalent access\\\" (cl 33.2 Disability Standards), it is difficult to characterise the conduct of the respondent as being anything more than a willingness to consult an organisation which was willing to provide information. In this sense, a comparison may be drawn with the consultation with the Foundation in Australian Conservation Foundation [1979] HCA 1 ; 146 CLR 493. Accordingly, I do not find comparisons with North Coast 127 ALR 617, Tasmanian Conservation Trust 127 ALR 580 or the National Trust of Australia (Vic) [1976] VR 592 cases of assistance in these proceedings.\",\"30\":\"47 I also note other cases where standing as \\\"aggrieved person\\\" has been recognised in relation to corporate bodies, including National Trust of Australia (Vic) v Australian Temperance and General Mutual Life Assurance Society Ltd [1976] VR 592, Tasmanian Conservation Trust Inc v Minister for Resources (1995) 127 ALR 580, North Coast Environment Council Inc v Minister for Resources (1994) 127 ALR 617 and Manuka Business Association Inc v The Australian Capital Territory Executive and Minister for the Environment, Land and Planning [1998] ACTSC 86.\\n\\n51 Eleventh, there are a number of cases where incorporated associations have sought to commence proceedings for breach of legislation in the environmental and human rights contexts.

Clearly, there is a different jurisprudential approach entailed by identifying whether rights created by statute are public rights permitting enforcement by an individual in circumstances only where the individual has a special interest, compared with considering legislation authorising a person aggrieved to enforce statutory rights created by the legislation. Nonetheless, it is certainly the case that Courts have explained the words \\\"person aggrieved\\\" in terms of special interest in the public law sense. So, for example, in Ricegrowers Co-operative Mills Ltd v Bannerman (1981) 56 FLR 443 at 447, Bowen CJ and Franki J said the words \\\"a person who is aggrieved\\\":\\n \\n ...are not to be confined to those who can establish that they have a legal interest at stake in the making of the decision. In our view they cover a person who can show a grievance which will be suffered as a result of the decision beyond that of an ordinary member of the public. (see Tooheys Ltd v Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (1981) 54 FLR 421 per Ellicott J)\\n (cf United States Tobacco Company v Minister for Consumer Affairs (1988) 20 FCR 520 at 527, Ogle v Strickland .)\\n\\n44 Fifth, traditionally the term \\\"person aggrieved\\\" should not be interpreted narrowly: N'Jie [1961] AC at 634 , Koowarta 153 CLR at 185, Tooheys Ltd v Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (1981) 54 FLR 421 at 437; Ogle v Strickland (1987) 13 FCR 306 (especially Fisher J at 307-308 and Lockhart J at 314-315). Further, as Gibbs CJ said in Onus v Alcoa of Australia Ltd 149 CLR at 36 in relation to whether a person has a \\\"special interest\\\" sufficient to sustain litigation,\\n \\n The rule is obviously a flexible one since, as was pointed out in [ Australian Conservation Foundation ], the question what is a sufficient interest will vary according to the nature of the subject matter of the litigation.\",\"32\":\"61 The decision in Manuka [1998] ACTSC 86 may be further contrasted with, for example, Onesteel Manufacturing Pty Ltd v Whyalla Red Dust Action Group Inc [2006] SASC 114 where Debelle J held that an association of 45 residents in the Whyalla area concerned with environmental issues involving the steel works operated by Onesteel [2006] SASC 114 was nonetheless not a \\\"person interested\\\" for the purposes of the relevant legislation because:\\n \\n It is unable to point to any physical injury or harm.

All that is known is that some of its members live, work or own property affected by dust from OneSteel's plant. One possible corollary is that some of its members may not be affected at all. (at [30])\",\"33\":\"24 Defining private rights for this purpose is a distinct challenge (note Heydon JD \\\"Injunctions and Declarations\\\" in Stein LA (ed) Locus Standi (Law Book Company, 1979) at 38-39). Traditionally they have included proprietary and financial interests (Davies J in Alphapharm Pty Ltd v Smithkline Beecham (Australia) Pty Ltd (1994) 49 FCR 250 at 259, Nicholson J in Allan v Development Allowance Authority (1998) 80 FCR 583 at 598). The distinction between rights which are \\\"private rights\\\" enabling commencement of proceedings by way, for example, of declaratory and injunctive relief, and \\\"public rights\\\" the enforcement of which lay at the feet of the Attorney-General, has however blurred over time to permit individuals to bring proceedings where the individual suffers special damage peculiar to himself or herself from the interference with the public right: Boyce [1903] 1 Ch at 114. Although this principle has received recognition in Australian law note for example comments of Gavan Duffy CJ, Starke and Evatt JJ in Anderson v Commonwealth of Australia [1932] HCA 2 ; (1932) 47 CLR 50 at 52; Mason J in Robinson v Western Australian Museum (1977) 138 CLR 238 at 327; Australian Conservation Foundation 146 CLR per Gibbs J at 526-527, Stephen J at 537-538 and Mason J at 547; Onus v Alcoa of Australia Ltd [1981] HCA 50 ; (1981) 149 CLR 27 per Gibbs CJ at 35-36, Davis [1986] HCA 66 ; (1986) 68 ALR 18; Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Association v Minister for Industrial Affairs of the State of South Australia [1995] HCA 11 ; (1995) 183 CLR 552 at 558; Allan v Development Allowance Authority 80 FCR per Wilcox J at 586-87, Nicholson J at 598 giving effect to the principle raises difficulties in itself. (A useful summary of cases, and difficulties of application of relevant principles, as existed at the time can be found in Heydon in Stein (1979) at 38-40, 45-54.)\\n\\n41 Third, in order for a person to be \\\"aggrieved\\\" the test is objective, not subjective. A person does not qualify merely because he or she feels aggrieved by the conduct. He or she, in the judgment of the Court, must, in truth, be aggrieved by that conduct ( Cameron v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission 46 FCR at 515) and not merely have an intellectual or emotional concern in the subject matter of the proceedings ( Australian Conservation Foundation 146 CLR at 547-548). The words do not include \\\"a mere busybody who is interfering in things which do not concern him: but they do include a person who has a genuine grievance because an order has been made which prejudicially affects his interests\\\": Attorney-General (Gambia) v N'Jie [1961] AC 617 at 634, Gibbs CJ in Koowarta v Bjelke-Petersen [1982] HCA 27 ; (1982) 153 CLR 168 at 185. It is not sufficient that a person voices a particular concern and regards the actions of another as injurious to the object of that concern (Stephen J in Australian Conservation Foundation 146 CLR at 539, Gibbs CJ in Onus v Alcoa of Australia 149 CLR at 37).\\n\\n44 Fifth, traditionally the term \\\"person aggrieved\\\" should not be interpreted narrowly: N'Jie [1961] AC at 634 , Koowarta 153 CLR at 185, Tooheys Ltd v Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (1981) 54 FLR 421 at 437; Ogle v Strickland (1987) 13 FCR 306 (especially Fisher J at 307-308 and Lockhart J at 314-315).

However the fact that legislation provides that conduct is \\\"unlawful\\\" does not of itself mean that exclusively public rights of enforcement exist in relation to that legislation. There is an extensive body of law which provides that simply because a statute deems that certain actions are required by law, and failure to comply is unlawful even to the extent of prescribing a penalty, it does not mean that personal actions are therefore excluded (note for example comments of Atkin LJ in Phillips [1923] 2 KB 832; Groves v Lord Wimborne [1898] 2 QB 402 especially at 415-416; Britannic Merthyr Coal Company Ltd v David [1910] AC 74; Knox CJ, Isaacs, Gavan Duffy and Rich JJ in Mallinson v The Scottish Australian Investment Company Ltd [1920] HCA 51 ; (1920) 28 CLR 66 at 70-72; Potter v Ferguson [1979] 1 NSWLR 364 at 372; Toohey J in University of Newcastle v Chopra [1989] HCA 27 ; (1989) 85 ALR 321 at 343; Campbell v University of New South Wales (1992) 44 IR 56 at 68-69; Gooley v Westpac Banking Corporation (1995) 129 ALR 628 at 648; \\\"GS\\\" v News Ltd (1998) Aust Torts Reports 81-466 at 64,906).

In all cases, notwithstanding the existence of other remedies (such as penalties), whether personal rights of action exist will depend on the construction of the statute itself.\",\"36\":\"39 I agree with the submissions of Mr Lenehan for the Commissioner which are in summary:\\n \\na. the jurisdiction of the Court is enlivened under s 46PO(1) HREOC Act where a \\\"complaint\\\" has been terminated by the President of HREOC\\n \\nb. the complaint must have been a valid complaint for the purposes of s 46P HREOC Act, namely that the complaint was lodged by or on behalf of a \\\"person aggrieved\\\" by the alleged unlawful discrimination\\n \\nc. in accepting the complaint under s 46P, HREOC is not making a determination which is binding on this Court as to whether the complainant is a \\\"person aggrieved\\\" for the purposes of s 46P. As Brennan J observed in Re Adams and the Tax Agents' Board (1976) 12 ALR 239 at 242 \\\"It is the court's judgment and not the administrative body's opinion which defines the extent of...its statutory authority\\\"\\n \\nd. it is not the case that whether a complainant is a \\\"person aggrieved\\\" can only be addressed by judicial review of the decision of HREOC to accept the complaint. This is inconsistent with Parliament's intention to create a process for handling discrimination complaints which would be efficient and unburdened by technicality ( Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 1998 (Cth) Second Reading Speech, Honourable Daryl Williams, Commonwealth Parliamentary Debates , House of Representatives, 3 December 1998, 1276).\",\"37\":\"25 Further, it is clear that legislation may create personal statutory rights which can be enforced by an individual in a Court of law: Wool Sliping and Scouring Co Ltd v Central Wool Committee [1920] HCA 21 ; (1920) 28 CLR 51 per Knox CJ at 61-62; Grand Central Car Park Pty Ltd v Tivoli Freeholders [1969] VR 62 at 76; SS Constructions Pty Ltd v Ventura Motors Pty Ltd [1964] VR 229 at 246, Dajon Investments Pty Ltd v Talbot [1969] VR 603 at 613, Australian Conservation Foundation 146 CLR at 537, 542-544; Re East, ex parte Nguyen [1998] HCA 73 ; (1998) 196 CLR 354. As Stephen J observed in Australian Conservation Foundation 146 CLR at 541, referring to s 52 Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth):\\n \\n statutes may of course confer standing in express terms...they may also do so by conferring some right the denial of the enjoyment of which gives standing to sue to complain of that denial. Although that very denial might be thought to qualify as the suffering of special damage such as that of which Buckley J spoke, it is, perhaps, preferable in such a case to resolve the question of standing by the direct route of a search for enforceable rights conferred by statute, rather than follow the circuitous course of seeking, in accordance with Boyce's Case, for the existence of special damage. (cf Gibbs J at 532)\\n\\n31 In contrast, in the case before me the HREOC Act and the DD Act (including the Disability Standards formulated pursuant to s 31) provide a scheme which allows \\\"a person aggrieved\\\" by alleged unlawful discrimination - including, as I have already noted, conduct deemed unlawful by s 32 DD Act - to lodge a complaint with HREOC (s 46P HREOC Act); and in the event that the complaint is terminated, a person affected by the termination to make application to the Federal Court or the Federal Magistrates Court (s 46PO HREOC Act). Significantly, the HREOC Act also creates a specific structure sanctioning applications to the Court for remedies where the Court is satisfied that there has been unlawful discrimination, including payment of damages by the respondent, employment or re-employment an applicant, an order declaring that the respondent has committed unlawful discrimination and directing the respondent not to repeat or continue such unlawful discrimination as is sought in this case (s 46PO(4) HREOC Act). Indeed the point of the statutory scheme as constituted in this case by the HREOC Act and the DD Act is to make laws with respect to discriminatory conduct, and to allow those who are aggrieved by discriminatory conduct, personal rights to seek redress in respect of such conduct. To adopt the language of the majority of the High Court in Re East, ex parte Nguyen 196 CLR at 365, repeated in Western Australia v Ward [2002] HCA 28 ; (2002) 213 CLR 1 at 96,\\n \\n The elaborate and special scheme...was plainly intended by the Parliament to provide the means by which a person aggrieved by a contravention ... might obtain a remedy, and thus was regarded by Parliament as fulfilling Australia's treaty obligations, bearing always in mind the legal structure and system which formed the context in which the [legislation] was to operate.\\n \\n\\n(That those comments were in respect of the legislation as it stood prior to amendments, and the removal of provisions from the HREOC Act into the DD Act and other statutes, does not in any way minimise their relevance. As observed, in my view correctly, by Nicholson J in Bropho v State of Western Australia [2004] FCA 1209 at [26] - [29] and [51]-[52], they are equally applicable to the scheme as it presently exists.)\\n\\n45 Sixth, in interpreting \\\"person aggrieved\\\" in this context, it is appropriate to accord a construction that would promote the purpose or object underlying the relevant legislation rather than a construction that would not promote that purpose or object: s 15AA(1) Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth). In light of the scheme created by the interaction of the HREOC Act and the DD Act for the purpose of permitting aggrieved persons to make complaints in relation to unlawful discrimination, it is prima facie appropriate to extend a consideration of the term beyond the purpose of the HREOC Act to include the purpose of the DD Act . This is particularly so given that the unlawful discrimination alleged derives from ss 31 and 32 DD Act . I have already noted observations of the High Court in Re East, ex parte Nguyen [1998] HCA 73 ; 196 CLR 354 as to the intentions of Parliament in relation to the scheme to provide the means by which a person aggrieved by a contravention might obtain a remedy. I also note the objects of the DD Act as stated in s 3 of the Act:\\n \\n The objects of this Act are: \\n \\n \\n (a) to eliminate, as far as possible, discrimination against persons on the ground of disability in the areas of: \\n \\n \\n (i) work, accommodation, education, access to premises, clubs and sport; and \\n (ii) the provision of goods, facilities, services and land; and \\n (iii) existing laws; and \\n (iv) the administration of Commonwealth laws and programs; and \\n \\n \\n (b) to ensure, as far as practicable, that persons with disabilities have the same rights to equality before the law as the rest of the community; and \\n (c) to promote recognition and acceptance within the community of the principle that persons with disabilities have the same fundamental rights as the rest of the community.\",\"38\":\"42 Fourth, the respondent's submissions concerning this issue have substantially equated \\\"person aggrieved\\\" for the purposes of s 46P HREOC Act with principles articulated in Boyce [1903] 1 Ch 109 and the possession by a complainant of a special interest so as to enforce the public rights created by statute. Clearly, there is a different jurisprudential approach entailed by identifying whether rights created by statute are public rights permitting enforcement by an individual in circumstances only where the individual has a special interest, compared with considering legislation authorising a person aggrieved to enforce statutory rights created by the legislation. Nonetheless, it is certainly the case that Courts have explained the words \\\"person aggrieved\\\" in terms of special interest in the public law sense. So, for example, in Ricegrowers Co-operative Mills Ltd v Bannerman (1981) 56 FLR 443 at 447, Bowen CJ and Franki J said the words \\\"a person who is aggrieved\\\":\\n \\n ...are not to be confined to those who can establish that they have a legal interest at stake in the making of the decision. In our view they cover a person who can show a grievance which will be suffered as a result of the decision beyond that of an ordinary member of the public. (see Tooheys Ltd v Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (1981) 54 FLR 421 per Ellicott J)\\n (cf United States Tobacco Company v Minister for Consumer Affairs (1988) 20 FCR 520 at 527, Ogle v Strickland .)\",\"39\":\"48 Eighth, merely incorporating a body and providing it with relevant objects does not provide it with standing it otherwise would not have had. This point was made clear in Right to Life Association (NSW) Inc v Secretary, Department of Human Services and Health (1995) 56 FCR 50, particularly by Lockhart J at 67. The Court in that case approved similar comments of Lindgren J at first instance where his Honour said:\\n \\n The applicant submitted that what distinguished it from ordinary members of the public was that it was organised, and since 1984 incorporated, with objects directly related to the subject matter of the decision sought to be challenged. But to accord the status of a \\\"person aggrieved\\\" for no more reason than this would be to elevate form above substance. It would allow individuals who were opposed to a decision, albeit sincerely and for unselfish motives, to acquire standing to challenge it by the procedure of devising an appropriate form of constitution, and if necessary procuring corporate form. It would, for example, distinguish between the unsuccessful Mr Cameron in Cameron v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission noted above and an incorporated association of individuals organised under a constitution with objects of seeking a more equitable allocation of scholarships to Fijians. In my opinion, the issue of standing is not to be foreclosed by such a formal distinction. ( Right to Life Association (NSW) Inc v The Secretary of the Commonwealth Department of Human Services and Health and Family Planning Victoria Inc , unreported, 23 September 1994, para 69)\\n\\n51 Eleventh, there are a number of cases where incorporated associations have sought to commence proceedings for breach of legislation in the environmental and human rights contexts. Traditionally, courts have tended to apply principles as to standing strictly and have frequently found that such organisations do not have an interest in the litigation, either because the association does not have a special interest in enforcing the relevant public right ( Australian Conservation Foundation [1979] HCA 1 ; 146 CLR 493, Central Queensland Speleological Society v Central Queensland Cement (No 1) [1989] 2 Qd R 512) or because the association is not a \\\"person aggrieved\\\" for the purposes of the relevant legislation ( Right To Life 50 FCR 56, Defence Coalition against RCD 74 FCR at 153). In a number of cases however the Court has held that the relevant association did have standing as a \\\"person aggrieved\\\" ( North Coast 127 ALR 617, Tasmanian Conservation Trust 127 ALR 580, National Trust of Australia [1976] VR 592, Manuka [1998] ACTSC 86). \\n Consideration and findings\",\"40\":\"23 The traditional approach to standing in matters involving the enforcement of statutes was that while interference with private rights could be asserted by individuals, public rights could only be asserted by the Attorney-General representing the public, either in the name of the Attorney or at the relation of some complainant: Boyce v Paddington Borough Council [1903] 1 Ch 109, Gouriet v Attorney-General [1977] UKHL 5 ; [1978] AC 435; Australian Conservation Foundation Inc v Commonwealth [1979] HCA 1 ; (1980) 146 CLR 493, Davis v Commonwealth [1986] HCA 66 ; (1986) 68 ALR 18 per Gibbs CJ at 35-36; Bateman's Bay Local Aboriginal Land Council v The Aboriginal Community Benefit Fund Pty Ltd [1998] HCA 49 ; (1998) 194 CLR 247 at 261. As observed by Mason J in Australian Conservation Foundation 146 CLR at 547-8:\\n \\n Depending on the nature of the relief which he seeks, a plaintiff will in general have a locus standi when he can show actual or apprehended injury or damage to his property or proprietary rights, to his business or economic interests...and perhaps to his social or political interests. Beyond making this general observation, I consider that there is nothing to be gained from discussing in the abstract the broad range of interests which may serve to support a locus standi for, as I said in Robinson v Western Australian Museum [1977] HCA 46 ; (1977) 138 CLR 283 at 327-328: \\\"The cases are infinitely various and so much depends in a given case on the nature of the relief which is sought, for what is a sufficient interest in one case may be less than sufficient in another\\\".\\n\\n24 Defining private rights for this purpose is a distinct challenge (note Heydon JD \\\"Injunctions and Declarations\\\" in Stein LA (ed) Locus Standi (Law Book Company, 1979) at 38-39). Traditionally they have included proprietary and financial interests (Davies J in Alphapharm Pty Ltd v Smithkline Beecham (Australia) Pty Ltd (1994) 49 FCR 250 at 259, Nicholson J in Allan v Development Allowance Authority (1998) 80 FCR 583 at 598). The distinction between rights which are \\\"private rights\\\" enabling commencement of proceedings by way, for example, of declaratory and injunctive relief, and \\\"public rights\\\" the enforcement of which lay at the feet of the Attorney-General, has however blurred over time to permit individuals to bring proceedings where the individual suffers special damage peculiar to himself or herself from the interference with the public right: Boyce [1903] 1 Ch at 114. Although this principle has received recognition in Australian law note for example comments of Gavan Duffy CJ, Starke and Evatt JJ in Anderson v Commonwealth of Australia [1932] HCA 2 ; (1932) 47 CLR 50 at 52; Mason J in Robinson v Western Australian Museum (1977) 138 CLR 238 at 327; Australian Conservation Foundation 146 CLR per Gibbs J at 526-527, Stephen J at 537-538 and Mason J at 547; Onus v Alcoa of Australia Ltd [1981] HCA 50 ; (1981) 149 CLR 27 per Gibbs CJ at 35-36, Davis [1986] HCA 66 ; (1986) 68 ALR 18; Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Association v Minister for Industrial Affairs of the State of South Australia [1995] HCA 11 ; (1995) 183 CLR 552 at 558; Allan v Development Allowance Authority 80 FCR per Wilcox J at 586-87, Nicholson J at 598 giving effect to the principle raises difficulties in itself.

As Stephen J observed in Australian Conservation Foundation 146 CLR at 541, referring to s 52 Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth):\\n \\n statutes may of course confer standing in express terms...they may also do so by conferring some right the denial of the enjoyment of which gives standing to sue to complain of that denial. Although that very denial might be thought to qualify as the suffering of special damage such as that of which Buckley J spoke, it is, perhaps, preferable in such a case to resolve the question of standing by the direct route of a search for enforceable rights conferred by statute, rather than follow the circuitous course of seeking, in accordance with Boyce's Case, for the existence of special damage. (cf Gibbs J at 532)\",\"43\":\"28 The applicant submitted in summary:\\n \\na. the issue of standing to commence an action under the HREOC Act or the DD Act is to be determined on the proper construction of those Acts, not by reference to provisions of other enactments or common law principles: Stephenson v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (1996) 68 FCR 290\\n \\nb. given that the legislation is for the benefit of a burdened class of the public, in the event of ambiguity the legislation should receive a beneficial interpretation: Cooper v Human Rights & Equal Opportunity Commission [1999] FCA 180 ; (1999) 93 FCR 481\\n \\nc. contravention of a standard may be cause for complaint under s 32 DD Act \\n \\nd. section 46P(2) HREOC Act defines who may lodge a complaint under the HREOC Act. The section contemplates a complaint by an \\\"aggrieved person\\\" on the basis of \\\"alleged unlawful discrimination\\\"\\n \\ne. the provisions of the HREOC Act and the DD Act make it plain that they confer private rights with respect to \\\"unlawful discrimination\\\" as defined in s 3 HREOC Act\\n \\nf. the proceedings in the Court involve a determination of the allegations of unlawful discrimination as set out in the complaint, and are circumscribed by the complaint which was terminated by the President\\n \\ng. the applicant's complaint concerns ss 31 and 32 DD Act , and the terms of the complaint and the proceedings before the Court raise the issue of a contravention of the Disability Standards\\n \\nh. the HREOC Act operates to allow complaints to be made about non-compliance with the Disability Standards. Section 46P(1) HREOC Act creates a private right to make a complaint based on s 32\\n \\ni. the material clearly identifies a dispute between the applicant and the respondent, namely the failure on the part of the respondent to comply with the Disability Standards\\n \\nj. Australian Conservation Foundation [1979] HCA 1 ; 146 CLR 493 is not relevant in this matter because the High Court found that the provisions of the relevant legislation in that case did not create private rights\\n \\nk. the approach taken by the High Court in Truth About Motorways [2000] HCA 11 ; 200 CLR 591 confirms that the provisions of the HREOC Act and the DD Act permit the applicant to proceed in this Court.\\n\\n33 Both the applicant and the Commissioner have submitted that in this case the issue of standing is to be determined on the proper construction of the HREOC Act and the DD Act , and not by reference to principles of general law. In my view this is correct. Findings supporting this submission were made by the Full Court in Stephenson v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission 68 FCR at 296 in relation to provisions of the HREOC Act and the Sex Discrimination Act 1985 (Cth) Further, I note observations of the High Court in Allan v Transurban City Link Ltd 208 CLR at 174 that:\\n \\n A particular statute may establish a regime which specifically provides for its own measure of judicial review on the application of persons meeting criteria specified in that statute.\",\"44\":\"36 Ms Eastman on behalf of the applicant submitted , inter alia , that:\\n \\na. the majority of the applicant's constituents are people with disabilities who are resident in the Maryborough and Hervey Bay areas of Queensland, and who have the requisite interest associated with the actions of the respondent in the provision of goods and services within the Hervey Bay area\\n \\nb. the applicant is an aggrieved person within the meaning of s 46P(2) HREOC Act\\n \\nc. HREOC's acceptance of the complaint would indicate that HREOC had accepted that the applicant was a person who could make a complaint for the purpose of s 46P(2) HREOC Act, and the respondent did not challenge that decision by way of judicial review under the ADJR Act \\n \\nd. once a decision was made by the President of HREOC to terminate the applicant's complaint pursuant to s 46PH(1) HREOC Act the applicant became an \\\"affected person\\\" as defined in s 3 HREOC Act. There is no requirement for the purpose of making an application to the Court that the applicant re-establish that it is an aggrieved person after the complaint was accepted by the Commission and investigated by the President. The applicant cites two decisions of the Federal Magistrates Court, Stokes v Royal Flying Doctor Service [2003] FMCA 164 and Access for All Alliance (Hervey Bay) Inc v Hervey Bay City Council [2004] FMCA 915 , in support of this proposition.\\n \\\"Person aggrieved\\\" - relevant principles\",\"45\":\"47 I also note other cases where standing as \\\"aggrieved person\\\" has been recognised in relation to corporate bodies, including National Trust of Australia (Vic) v Australian Temperance and General Mutual Life Assurance Society Ltd [1976] VR 592, Tasmanian Conservation Trust Inc v Minister for Resources (1995) 127 ALR 580, North Coast Environment Council Inc v Minister for Resources (1994) 127 ALR 617 and Manuka Business Association Inc v The Australian Capital Territory Executive and Minister for the Environment, Land and Planning [1998] ACTSC 86.\\n\\n51 Eleventh, there are a number of cases where incorporated associations have sought to commence proceedings for breach of legislation in the environmental and human rights contexts. Traditionally, courts have tended to apply principles as to standing strictly and have frequently found that such organisations do not have an interest in the litigation, either because the association does not have a special interest in enforcing the relevant public right ( Australian Conservation Foundation [1979] HCA 1 ; 146 CLR 493, Central Queensland Speleological Society v Central Queensland Cement (No 1) [1989] 2 Qd R 512) or because the association is not a \\\"person aggrieved\\\" for the purposes of the relevant legislation ( Right To Life 50 FCR 56, Defence Coalition against RCD 74 FCR at 153). In a number of cases however the Court has held that the relevant association did have standing as a \\\"person aggrieved\\\" ( North Coast 127 ALR 617, Tasmanian Conservation Trust 127 ALR 580, National Trust of Australia [1976] VR 592, Manuka [1998] ACTSC 86). \\n Consideration and findings\\n\\n63 Further, although of somewhat debatable significance (note comments of Lockhart J in Right to Life 56 FCR at 253), unlike in the North Coast 127 ALR 617, Tasmanian Conservation Trust 127 ALR 580 and National Trust of Australia (Vic) [1976] VR 592, there is no evidence before me that the applicant in this case is considered to be a peak body representing the interests of the disabled in the Hervey Bay region of Queensland, or that the applicant has been recognised by government as a body representing the concerns of the disabled in the Hervey Bay region of Queensland or had participated in official government decision-making processes. Further, while I note from correspondence attached to the affidavit of Mr Robin Andrew King sworn 8 November 2005 that the respondent has acknowledged the applicant's interest in bus shelter infrastructure in the region and sought the input of the applicant and its members (annexure RK 3), and that the Disability Standards require, inter alia , that a provider must consult with \\\"passengers with disabilities who use their service, or with organisations representing people with disabilities, about any proposal for equivalent access\\\" (cl 33.2 Disability Standards), it is difficult to characterise the conduct of the respondent as being anything more than a willingness to consult an organisation which was willing to provide information. In this sense, a comparison may be drawn with the consultation with the Foundation in Australian Conservation Foundation [1979] HCA 1 ; 146 CLR 493. Accordingly, I do not find comparisons with North Coast 127 ALR 617, Tasmanian Conservation Trust 127 ALR 580 or the National Trust of Australia (Vic) [1976] VR 592 cases of assistance in these proceedings.\",\"46\":\"26 Whether a statute confers upon individuals personal rights and standing to enforce those rights are matters to be determined on the construction of the statute, by reference to the subject, scope and purpose of that statute: Allan v Transurban City Link Ltd [2001] HCA 58 ; (2001) 208 CLR 167 at 174; cf McInerney J in Grand Central Car Park [1969] VR at 74, Kaye and Marks JJ in Thorne v Doug Wade Consultants Pty Ltd [1985] VR 433 at 486 and Atkin LJ in Phillips v Britannia Hygienic Laundry Co Ltd [1923] 2 KB 832 at 841.\\n This case\",\"47\":\"42 Fourth, the respondent's submissions concerning this issue have substantially equated \\\"person aggrieved\\\" for the purposes of s 46P HREOC Act with principles articulated in Boyce [1903] 1 Ch 109 and the possession by a complainant of a special interest so as to enforce the public rights created by statute.

The applicant has no special interest or private right asserted by the litigation, and there is no statutory basis providing standing in respect of the complaint: Truth About Motorways Pty Ltd v Macquarie Infrastructure Management Ltd [2000] HCA 11 ; (1999) 200 CLR 591\\n \\nd. no relator action is brought in the name of the Attorney-General at the applicant's request that such proceeding be undertaken: Farley & Lewers Ltd v AG [1963] NSWR 1624\\n \\ne. this is not a case where the interference with a public right is such that the applicant suffers special damage peculiar to itself from the interference: Boyce [1903] 1 Ch 109\\n \\nf. the applicant does not have standing to bring the prosecution.

However the fact that legislation provides that conduct is \\\"unlawful\\\" does not of itself mean that exclusively public rights of enforcement exist in relation to that legislation. There is an extensive body of law which provides that simply because a statute deems that certain actions are required by law, and failure to comply is unlawful even to the extent of prescribing a penalty, it does not mean that personal actions are therefore excluded (note for example comments of Atkin LJ in Phillips [1923] 2 KB 832; Groves v Lord Wimborne [1898] 2 QB 402 especially at 415-416; Britannic Merthyr Coal Company Ltd v David [1910] AC 74; Knox CJ, Isaacs, Gavan Duffy and Rich JJ in Mallinson v The Scottish Australian Investment Company Ltd [1920] HCA 51 ; (1920) 28 CLR 66 at 70-72; Potter v Ferguson [1979] 1 NSWLR 364 at 372; Toohey J in University of Newcastle v Chopra [1989] HCA 27 ; (1989) 85 ALR 321 at 343; Campbell v University of New South Wales (1992) 44 IR 56 at 68-69; Gooley v Westpac Banking Corporation (1995) 129 ALR 628 at 648; \\\"GS\\\" v News Ltd (1998) Aust Torts Reports 81-466 at 64,906). In all cases, notwithstanding the existence of other remedies (such as penalties), whether personal rights of action exist will depend on the construction of the statute itself.\",\"51\":\"50 Tenth, to the extent that incorporated associations are bodies corporate which may sue or be sued in their own name, in assessing the interests of a body corporate the interests of its members are arguably irrelevant. So in Victorian Chamber of Manufactures v The Commonwealth [1943] HCA 19 ; (1943) 67 CLR 335 at 343 Starke J, without needing to decide the point, observed that an infringement of the rights of members of an incorporated body does of itself mean that the rights of the incorporated body are infringed, or that the incorporated body has standing to maintain an action (cf Lockhart J in Right to Life 56 FCR at 253 and Nicholson J in Defence Coalition against RCD Inc v Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (1997) 74 FCR 142). This may be distinguished from the position concerning unincorporated associations. A useful illustration of this point in this context is Scully 79 FCR 537, where an unincorporated association commenced proceedings under the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth) (in its then form), Wilcox J said:\\n \\n I agree with Commissioner Nettlefold that, as Executive Council for Australian Jewry is not a \\\"person\\\" in the eyes of the law, it is incapable of being a 'person aggrieved' within the meaning of s 22(1) of the Racial Discrimination Act . Therefore it is not itself a competent complainant. However, this does not mean its complaint is a nullity. It is necessary to go behind the name and consider whether the juristic persons who constitute the unincorporated association are 'persons aggrieved' by the allegedly unlawful act. If they are, the complaint is competent in law, though not in name, as it was made by them. (at 548)\\n\\n59 Second, there is substantial body of authority, to which I have already referred, that the interests of members of a body corporate do not equate with the interests of the body corporate: Victorian Chamber of Manufactures [1943] HCA 19 ; 67 CLR 335, Right to Life 56 FCR 50, Defence Coalition against RCD 74 FCR 142.\",\"52\":\"31 In contrast, in the case before me the HREOC Act and the DD Act (including the Disability Standards formulated pursuant to s 31) provide a scheme which allows \\\"a person aggrieved\\\" by alleged unlawful discrimination - including, as I have already noted, conduct deemed unlawful by s 32 DD Act - to lodge a complaint with HREOC (s 46P HREOC Act); and in the event that the complaint is terminated, a person affected by the termination to make application to the Federal Court or the Federal Magistrates Court (s 46PO HREOC Act). Significantly, the HREOC Act also creates a specific structure sanctioning applications to the Court for remedies where the Court is satisfied that there has been unlawful discrimination, including payment of damages by the respondent, employment or re-employment an applicant, an order declaring that the respondent has committed unlawful discrimination and directing the respondent not to repeat or continue such unlawful discrimination as is sought in this case (s 46PO(4) HREOC Act). Indeed the point of the statutory scheme as constituted in this case by the HREOC Act and the DD Act is to make laws with respect to discriminatory conduct, and to allow those who are aggrieved by discriminatory conduct, personal rights to seek redress in respect of such conduct. To adopt the language of the majority of the High Court in Re East, ex parte Nguyen 196 CLR at 365, repeated in Western Australia v Ward [2002] HCA 28 ; (2002) 213 CLR 1 at 96,\\n \\n The elaborate and special scheme...was plainly intended by the Parliament to provide the means by which a person aggrieved by a contravention ... might obtain a remedy, and thus was regarded by Parliament as fulfilling Australia's treaty obligations, bearing always in mind the legal structure and system which formed the context in which the [legislation] was to operate.\\n \\n\\n(That those comments were in respect of the legislation as it stood prior to amendments, and the removal of provisions from the HREOC Act into the DD Act and other statutes, does not in any way minimise their relevance. As observed, in my view correctly, by Nicholson J in Bropho v State of Western Australia [2004] FCA 1209 at [26] - [29] and [51]-[52], they are equally applicable to the scheme as it presently exists.)\",\"53\":\"25 Further, it is clear that legislation may create personal statutory rights which can be enforced by an individual in a Court of law: Wool Sliping and Scouring Co Ltd v Central Wool Committee [1920] HCA 21 ; (1920) 28 CLR 51 per Knox CJ at 61-62; Grand Central Car Park Pty Ltd v Tivoli Freeholders [1969] VR 62 at 76; SS Constructions Pty Ltd v Ventura Motors Pty Ltd [1964] VR 229 at 246, Dajon Investments Pty Ltd v Talbot [1969] VR 603 at 613, Australian Conservation Foundation 146 CLR at 537, 542-544; Re East, ex parte Nguyen [1998] HCA 73 ; (1998) 196 CLR 354. As Stephen J observed in Australian Conservation Foundation 146 CLR at 541, referring to s 52 Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth):\\n \\n statutes may of course confer standing in express terms...they may also do so by conferring some right the denial of the enjoyment of which gives standing to sue to complain of that denial. Although that very denial might be thought to qualify as the suffering of special damage such as that of which Buckley J spoke, it is, perhaps, preferable in such a case to resolve the question of standing by the direct route of a search for enforceable rights conferred by statute, rather than follow the circuitous course of seeking, in accordance with Boyce's Case, for the existence of special damage.
