I have difficulty in seeing how the decision of Hodgson J in Australian Hydrocarbons establishes the proposition in question. However, in Re Westpac Banking Corporation , Emmett J, having referred to Comcorp , said (at [27]): \\n \\n 'I consider that the syntax of s 1322(6)(a) is quite clear in contemplating that only one of the three paragraphs of s 1322(6)(a) needs to be satisfied in order to authorise the making of an order.'\",\"1\":\"In Commissioner of Taxation v Comcorp Australia Ltd (1996) 70 FCR 356 Sheppard J (at 373E) (in dissent as to the result) expressed the opinion that only irregularities of a procedural kind are able to be cured by s 1322. Carr J (with whom Lockhart J agreed) seemed to proceed upon the same basis but took a wide view of matters which were essentially of a procedural nature (398 400). The issue that arises here does not appear to have been argued.\\n\\nIn Jordan v Avram (1997) 141 FLR 275; (1997) 25 ACSR 153 Gillard J accepted that the conditions are not cumulative, relying upon Australian Hydrocarbons NL v Green (1985) 10 ACLR 72 at 83, but without noticing Comcorp.

Judges of the Supreme Courts of New South Wales and Victoria have taken a view similar to that of Emmett J and consistency of decisions in this area is desirable.\\n\\nIt was appropriate to make the order without any other party being joined. Each of ASIC and Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority (APRA) has been advised about the proceedings and neither has indicated any substantive opposition to the making of the order. There is no other natural contradictor.\\n\\nThere was a second problem. One of the conditions of exemption was that the plaintiffs would not exercise votes attached to NAB shares nor control or influence the exercise of votes attached to NAB shares. This condition was breached on a number of occasions, essentially because of the operation of an automated proxy voting system in relation to the Annual General Meeting of NAB held on 30 January 2006. There have been substantial purchases of NAB shares by the plaintiffs since 30 January 2006.\",\"2\":\"In Cordiant Communications (Australia) Pty Ltd v Communications Group Holdings Pty Ltd [2005] NSWSC 1005 ; (2005) 194 FLR 322; (2005) 55 ACSR 185, Palmer J expressed the opinion that s 1322(4) can be utilised to validate a substantive rather than a procedural irregularity ([97] and [134]) without referring to authority.\",\"3\":\"In Jordan v Avram (1997) 141 FLR 275; (1997) 25 ACSR 153 Gillard J accepted that the conditions are not cumulative, relying upon Australian Hydrocarbons NL v Green (1985) 10 ACLR 72 at 83, but without noticing Comcorp.

Emmett J took that view in Re Commonwealth Bank of Australia at [15] and ASIC takes the same view. On that basis, relief pursuant to s 1322(4)(a) is appropriate if the conditions pursuant to s 1322(6) are met. I am satisfied that the casting of the votes did not affect the result of the vote taken upon any resolution. I am satisfied that the relevant non-compliance was inadvertent and that the persons concerned acted honestly. I am satisfied that no substantial injustice has been or is likely to be caused to any person by the making of the order. I am also satisfied that it is just and equitable that the order be made. The conditions pursuant to s 1322(6) are satisfied. I am satisfied that it was appropriate to make the order in the absence of the joinder of another party.\\n\\nFor those reasons I made the orders sought in substance. The orders followed the form of the section by validating the transactions.
