I will deal with each element of the test in Coco in turn.\\n\\n89 As Megarry J put it, \\\"there can be no breach of confidence in revealing to others something which is already common knowledge\\\" ( Coco, at 47).

The parties proceeded in this case as if it were a patent matter, presenting expert testimony regarding prior art, common general knowledge, and so forth. That is to say, they implicitly proceeded as if the Krueger design had to be patentable in order to be confidential. No doubt this approach was influenced at least in part by the ongoing patent application by Krueger in respect of the design at issue and the fact that the same experts were retained by the parties in both proceedings; Camerons' expert gave candid evidence that he was unaware of any distinction between patent, copyright, and breach of confidence litigation, and that he and Krueger's expert approached this case as if it were a patent dispute. Unfortunately, this is a fundamentally wrong approach in breach of confidence litigation. As Megarry J said in Coco (at 48), one should not get caught up by particular adjectives such as novel; \\\"whether it is described as originality or novelty or ingenuity or otherwise, I think there must be some product of the human brain which suffices to confer a confidential nature upon the information\\\". To put it more plainly, information need not be patentable, copyrightable, or otherwise protected by the intellectual property laws in order to be confidential. Common examples of commercial information that may be considered confidential even if not novel in the patent law sense include customer lists, price lists, business proposals, and marketing strategies. In this regard, I would draw the parties' attention to the concise definition of confidentiality provided by IP Toolbox in its handy reference page, \\\"The concept of legal confidentiality\\\" (available at http:\\/\\/www.iptoolbox.gov.au\\/default.asp?print=true&action=article&ID=194):\\n Confidential information need not be entirely composed of information that is not available publicly. Public information can also be considered as confidential. This depends on the way a business uses the information. A customer list, for example, can be protected as having the necessary legal confidentiality where it has been developed and treated as confidential, even though it is drawn from information which is publicly known (ie. telephone records, trade journals, public registers etc). Legal confidentiality can be distinguished from the requirements for patent or design registration. The latter require that the concept be inventive and novel (or in the case of a design, an advance on the 'prior art' base). Legal confidentiality can protect uninventive information as long as it is not in the public domain. (Emphasis added.)\\n\\n93 Notwithstanding that definition, the obligation of the Court is to decide the case that has been put, not the case that should have been put. Accordingly, I will approach the issue of confidentiality as it was argued - that for the Krueger Concept to be protected it must not have been routine or otherwise a minor variation of common general knowledge. In that respect, Krueger submitted that there were at least two bases on which its design could be seen as novel as compared to existing load restraint systems. I turn to consider those bases now.\\n\\n94 Camerons accepted that an ability for gates to overlap or stack would have set the Krueger Concept apart from pre-existing load restraint systems so that the Krueger Concept would not have been routine or already publicly known. Camerons submitted, however, that the ability of the gates to overlap or stack was, in fact, not conveyed by the confidential information.\\n\\n104 The concession of Mr Cameron does not end the inquiry, however, because not everything that is confidential in business is necessarily deemed confidential in law. What is important for information to attract a legal obligation of confidence is that \\\"the preservation of its confidentiality or secrecy is of substantial concern to the plaintiff\\\": Moorgate Tobacco Co Ltd v Philip Morris Ltd (No 2) [1984] HCA 73 ; (1984) 156 CLR 414 at 438. In Moorgate , the High Court found that information relating to a new cigarette brand was not confidential in part because it comprised merely standard marketing materials that would be shown to any prospective licensees, not just the defendant. Here, on the other hand, it is clear that Krueger created the information and communicated it to Camerons so that Krueger, and only Krueger, would win the business with Camerons. It is thus objectively reasonable in the circumstances of this case that the preservation of the information's confidentiality and secrecy (specifically, its non-disclosure to competitors such as Vawdrey) was of substantial concern to Krueger. Accordingly, I conclude that the information in [3] attracted an obligation of confidentiality under the 'reasonable man' test propounded by Megarry J in Coco at 48.\\n\\n106 Analysis of this third element requires what Megarry J in Coco (at 50) describes as both a strict and broad approach. The strict approach, which Megarry J suggested should be applied in commercial cases such as this, requires some detriment suffered by the provider of the confidential information for equity to intervene. In contrast, under the broad approach, unauthorised use does not necessarily need to be accompanied by detriment. In the years since Coco , however, the cases have cast considerable doubt on whether detriment should be considered part of the cause of action even in commercial cases: see L Tsaknis, \\\" The Jurisdictional Basis, Elements and Remedies in the Action for Breach of Confidence Uncertainty Abounds \\\" (1993) 5 Bond University Review 18, 21-23 (collecting the cases and stating, \\\"It is not clear whether the confider must suffer any detriment as a result of the unauthorised disclosure, though the balance of the authority suggests that the better view is that detriment is not required\\\"). I do not consider the point further, however, because Krueger did not raise it, relying instead principally on Coco . In any event, nothing much turns on detriment in the present case because detriment is not an issue if Krueger is successful in establishing the other elements, detriment was clearly suffered by Krueger in that it lost the contract with Camerons in respect of the Amcor Tender.\\n\\n107 Krueger provided its information to Camerons for the limited purpose of winning a contract with Camerons for the manufacture of approximately 20 truck trailers. In order to advance this purpose, it allowed Camerons to include part of that information (the Subsequent Krueger Drawings) in the tender Camerons submitted to Amcor. As noted earlier, it was not submitted that the authorised disclosure of the Subsequent Krueger Drawing to Amcor robbed that drawing of its confidential character or released Camerons from its otherwise general obligation to maintain it in confidence. Camerons had asked for permission to disclose it to Amcor. It had not asked for permission to disclose it more generally.\\n\\n108 That leaves the issue of unauthorised use of the confidential information. If it is shown that Camerons provided Krueger's information (or part of it) to Vawdrey, allowing Vawdrey to eventually win the work with Camerons, Krueger suffered detriment from that unauthorised use. As noted earlier in these reasons (see [81] to [83]), I concluded that Camerons, knowing the Krueger Concept to contain information confidential to Krueger, made unauthorised use of it by disclosing it to Vawdrey without the consent of Krueger.\",\"7\":\"123 In assessing whether copyright subsists in a work, it must be clear exactly what copyright is claimed over, as copyright protects only the form in which ideas and information are expressed: Baker v Selden [1879] USSC 9 ; (1879) 101 US 99.

The inference may be made only as the most probable deduction from the established facts, but it must at least be a deduction which may reasonably be drawn from them.

Vawdrey's evidence of the existence of the \\\"Vawdrey-type lock\\\" included two engineering drawings and the job sheet referred to earlier: see [101]. When the lock came into existence is in dispute. However, it is unnecessary to resolve that dispute. Even if the two engineering drawings relied upon by Vawdrey were created in 1995, the Krueger Drawings are still original. As I have said earlier, it is the originality of the form of expression rather than originality of the concept of sliding side posts with fixed gates attached that is required for copyright protection. Even assuming the concept were not novel in itself, novelty is not a requirement for copyright protection. What is relevant is that the Krueger Drawings represent an independent application by Hunt of his judgment, skill and labour and portray an original, distinctive expression of the concept to that of the Vawdrey drawings of the Vawdrey-type lock (which in any event do not even convey the same concept, as noted in [101] above): see LED Builders Pty Ltd v Eagle Homes Pty Ltd (1996) 35 IPR 215.

Although inferences from facts can be drawn to substantiate a causal connection (see eg Tamawood Ltd v Henley Arch Pty Ltd (2004) 61 IPR 378 , 387; LED Builders at 225), there must still be established facts from which to infer that the allegedly infringing party had access to the copyright material.\\n\\n132 Here, the facts established by the objective evidence provide a basis for inferring that Vawdrey had indirect access to the substance of the Krueger Drawings as a result of disclosure by Camerons: see [70] [78] above. Particularly relevant is my conclusion that shortly after winning the Tender, Camerons requested that Vawdrey increase the size of the gates in its design and change the number of posts from six to seven in order to conform to the design shown in the Krueger Subsequent Drawing included in the Tender proposal. Those facts put this case on all fours with LED Builders , where the court found (at 225) indirect copying based on the giving of oral instructions by an intermediary to bring the infringing design plans into line with the copyright holder's. I am satisfied that the same thing occurred here.\\n\\n133 The next question is to determine whether Vawdrey copied a substantial part of the Krueger Drawings?\\n\\n134 When one compares the Vawdrey Engineering Drawings (being the drawings from which the trailers were constructed) with the Subsequent Krueger Drawings, that question must be answered \\\"yes\\\". However, in answering that question, it is necessary to exclude from that analysis those elements that are unprotected by copyright. There was nothing in the unprotected concept that dictated the number of posts or the size of the gates. Here both the Vawdrey Engineering Drawings and the Subsequent Krueger Drawings featured seven posts with gates attached of nearly identical size and shape. Vawdrey submitted that these similarities were an inevitable result of the fixed parameters of a 48ft trailer. I reject that submission. The content of the First Vawdrey Drawing (see Annexure 6) demonstrates the error in that submission. In that drawing, the same concept was expressed using only six sliding posts with gates that were smaller and in the shape of a hoop. In addition, Krueger's expert, Dr Hart, gave evidence that the Krueger Concept could be expressed in numerous ways. In light of this evidence, I am satisfied that there were multiple ways in which the same concept was capable of expression but the Vawdrey Engineering Drawings used substantially the same form of expression as the Subsequent Krueger Drawings.\",\"17\":\"111 Where parties enter into written or verbal confidentiality agreements prior to commercial negotiations, the terms of the agreement usually govern the rights and obligations of the parties to that agreement. This is so even in relation to information that may not truly be confidential (for example because it has lost its confidentiality by reason of being in the public domain): Maggbury Pty Ltd v Hafele Australia Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 70 ; (2002) 210 CLR 181. Nonetheless, the High Court found that the agreement in question in Maggbury was an unreasonable restraint of trade because the information the agreement sought to protect was in the public domain and had been put there by Maggbury itself.\\n\\n112 Krueger submitted there was a contractual obligation arising out of an express agreement to keep certain information confidential between Krueger and Camerons at the Cameron \\/ Krueger meeting. The evidence of John Krueger and Grant Krueger was that at the beginning of the meeting with Camerons, John Krueger specifically requested that all information discussed in the meeting be kept private and confidential. Mr Cameron denies that confidentiality was discussed at any point during the meeting and denies that there was any express agreement as to confidentiality. He said that if the issue had been raised, he would have been offended. Initially, Tindal denied that confidentiality was discussed but later accepted he could not recall whether confidentiality was discussed at the meeting.\\n\\n113 Both Grant and John Krueger asserted that Krueger had good reason to demand a confidentiality agreement from Camerons on the basis that Camerons rarely bought trucks from Krueger and he had the impression that Camerons was not seriously considering contracting with Krueger, but instead trying to keep Vawdrey competitive. It is true Camerons had not purchased many new Krueger trucks directly from Krueger for some years, though they did own a number of Krueger trucks they had purchased on the second hand market.\\n\\n115 In this respect, as in others, I prefer the evidence of the Krueger witnesses to that of Camerons' witnesses. That is, I find that there was an oral agreement between Krueger and Camerons that \\\"any quotation, drawings and technical and pricing information provided by Krueger, including the Krueger Concept, would be kept confidential. (The consideration for that agreement was an exchange of promises - a promise of confidentiality in consideration for a promise to proceed with the negotiations and submit a design proposal.) Moreover, that agreement was a reasonable restraint of trade because, unlike in Maggbury , the Krueger Concept was not already in the public domain. Finally, for the reasons given earlier (see [81]-[83]), Camerons breached that agreement.\\n\\n116 Camerons submitted that, even if it breached an equitable or contractual obligation of confidentiality to Krueger, it was nevertheless not liable in damages because Krueger lost the contract with Camerons for reasons unrelated to disclosure of the confidential design information. Specifically, it argued that Vawdrey won the contract for reasons of delivery time, price, difficulties with hire trailers, and reliability of supply.\\n\\n117 Having carefully reviewed those submissions, I find that the evidence does not support them. In that regard, I need not rely on the principle that I should more readily infer that the wrongdoer achieved its desired objective: eg omnia praesumuntur contra spoliatorem . Instead, I find as a matter of fact that, but for the disclosure of Krueger's confidential information by Camerons to Vawdrey, Krueger would have won the contract with Camerons. Further, I find that it was reasonably foreseeable to Camerons at the time it disclosed the confidential information that Vawdrey would use the information to improve its design solution and win the contract to the detriment of Krueger.\",\"18\":\"104 The concession of Mr Cameron does not end the inquiry, however, because not everything that is confidential in business is necessarily deemed confidential in law. What is important for information to attract a legal obligation of confidence is that \\\"the preservation of its confidentiality or secrecy is of substantial concern to the plaintiff\\\": Moorgate Tobacco Co Ltd v Philip Morris Ltd (No 2) [1984] HCA 73 ; (1984) 156 CLR 414 at 438. In Moorgate , the High Court found that information relating to a new cigarette brand was not confidential in part because it comprised merely standard marketing materials that would be shown to any prospective licensees, not just the defendant. Here, on the other hand, it is clear that Krueger created the information and communicated it to Camerons so that Krueger, and only Krueger, would win the business with Camerons. It is thus objectively reasonable in the circumstances of this case that the preservation of the information's confidentiality and secrecy (specifically, its non-disclosure to competitors such as Vawdrey) was of substantial concern to Krueger. Accordingly, I conclude that the information in [3] attracted an obligation of confidentiality under the 'reasonable man' test propounded by Megarry J in Coco at 48.\",\"19\":\"127 The Krueger Drawings were produced by Stephen Hunt from the Krueger Sketch and further oral explanations of the load restraint issue from Adel Gerges (see above at [33]-[35] and [37]). The Krueger Drawings are similar. However, that does not mean they are less likely to be original; the redrawing of a technical drawing may still involve considerable skill, time and effort on the part of the draftsperson: Interlego AG v Croner Trading Pty Ltd [1992] FCA 624 ; (1992) 39 FCR 348 , 378-379 per Gummow J; New England Country Homes Pty Ltd v Moore (199) 82 FCR 500 , 502-503 per Burchett J.\",\"20\":\"131 Krueger's claim for infringement of copyright in the Krueger Drawings, which do contain a distinct expression of the concept contained in the Krueger Sketch, does not fail.

Those notes record, in part, \\\" 11 POSTS AS COVERAGE ON \\\". Paul Vawdrey's evidence was that the note recorded that a load restraint proposal was discussed by Vawdrey and Cameron that he (Paul Vawdrey) proposed. He said that he proposed to use a post per pallet space and that Mr Cameron and Mr Tindal liked the idea. Significantly, the notes do not describe anything \\\"hanging off\\\" or \\\"extending from\\\" each post, nor do they otherwise suggest that at this meeting there was any discussion of such a load restraint system.\\n\\n20 Paul Vawdrey's evidence at trial was substantially different from and inconsistent with the account he had previously provided to the Patents Office of the same events on 15 March 2005 in the context of a patent application by Krueger for what became known as the \\\"Slide-A-Gate\\\" system. In his statutory declaration to the Patents Office, Paul Vawdrey described the meeting in the following terms:\\n \\n \\n On the morning of 2 December 2002 I visited a customer of my company, being Glen Cameron Nominees Pty Ltd (hereinafter GCN), and met with Mr Glen Cameron and Mr Martyn Tindal. GCN were seeking to purchase 22 curtain sided semi-trailers for transporting double loaded pallets. I recall a discussion in the meeting about restraining the load and I recall the suggestion ( I do not recall by whom ) of using existing (\\\"knee joint\\\") sliding side posts at each pallet space to restrain the load. In other words the posts would be spaced along the sides of the trailer mid-way between the ends of each pair of double loaded pallets to prevent the pallets, and hence the goods on the pallets, from moving off the sides of the trailer. I further recall some concern being expressed at the meeting, as to whether a single post at each pallet space would be sufficient to restrain the load, or whether some additional restraint should be provided on each post . \\n \\n (Emphasis added.)\\n \\n \\n\\n This account of events does not support his evidence in this case that he was the author of the proposal to use sliding side posts to restrain the load. Further, there was no reference in the statutory declaration to anything \\\"hanging off\\\" or \\\"extending\\\" from each post. Taken at its highest, the account of events given in the statutory declaration spoke only of a concern being expressed that \\\"some additional restraint should be provided on each post\\\". Whether there would need to be additional restraint and, if so, what it might be, was not said to have been discussed.\\n\\n21 What is not now in dispute is that during the Cameron \\/ Vawdrey meeting Paul Vawdrey drew hand sketches of the load restraint proposals discussed during the meeting. The hand sketches are entitled, respectively, \\\" CARGO NET INNER CURTAIN TRACK \\\", which has been crossed through (consistent with the rejection of that proposal by Mr Cameron during the meeting, see [24] below) and \\\" 1 POST PER PALLET SPACING \\\". A copy of each of the sketches is in Annexure 2. The latter sketch was not crossed through. Mr Cameron recalls Paul Vawdrey drawing sketches during the meeting but does not recall what they looked like. Tindal recalls Paul Vawdrey drawing \\\"1 Post Per Pallet Spacing\\\". He also recalls that Paul Vawdrey \\\"drew some other sketches\\\" but does not recall what they looked like. Tindal was also in the habit of making handwritten notes about the proposals. Tindal's handwritten notes on Camerons' copy of the Second Vawdrey Quote include:\\n 11 Two(2) sliding posts per side.\\n\\n22 These contemporaneous documents thus record that during the course of the Cameron \\/ Vawdrey meeting the idea of a \\\"post per pallet\\\" was discussed. The contemporaneous documents do not suggest, however, that there was any discussion of anything \\\"hanging off\\\" or \\\"extending from\\\" each post.\\n\\n24 Mr Cameron reiterated the substance of that evidence before me. What then did Tindal's affidavit say? So far as is relevant, his evidence was that it was he (Martyn Tindal), not Paul Vawdrey, who raised the issue of a load restraint system that would \\\"restrain double stacked pallets and prevent them from falling out when the curtains on the side of the trailer were opened.\\\" Tindal recalled that Paul Vawdrey suggested using cargo nets but that was immediately dismissed because the nets would have caught on the pallets. That is consistent with Paul Vawdrey having drawn the sketch labelled \\\"CARGO NET INNER CURTAIN TRACK\\\" and then crossing it through (see [21] above).\\n\\n25 According to Tindal, it was after the rejection of the cargo net idea that Mr Cameron asked Paul Vawdrey if they could use conventional sliding posts located at each pallet space along the side of the trailer with \\\"something hanging off or extending from each post to act as a load restraint, which was smaller and lighter than most traditional gates... [but] big enough to restrain double stacked pallets and not allow them to slip through\\\".\\n\\n26 What then is said to have occurred, at least according to Tindal (and by him adopting it, Mr Cameron) is that Mr Cameron also said \\\"it would not be practical to have one post per pallet space because it would be laborious to remove all the posts\\\" (emphasis added). One post per pallet space would have required 12 posts on each side of a 48ft trailer. Paul Vawdrey is also said to have indicated that he would submit a drawing and a cost estimate.\\n\\n33 Secondly, Grant Krueger met with Gerges and drew another hand sketch of the Krueger Concept. A copy of that sketch is at Annexure 3. In his presence, Gerges drew a further hand sketch of the Krueger Concept. A copy of that sketch is at Annexure 4. These events demonstrate that as early as the afternoon of 2 December 2002, Grant Krueger (who had no relevant engineering experience) was aware of and understood the Krueger Concept so that he was able to sketch the Krueger Concept and explain it to Gerges (the Krueger engineer). Armed with these two explanations, Gerges was able to prepare his own sketch and then direct the preparation of appropriate engineering layouts depicting the Krueger Concept. This series of events is significant as will become obvious later in these reasons for decision.\\n\\n34 The next day, 3 December 2002, Gerges asked another Krueger employee, Stephen Hunt, to prepare engineering layouts depicting the Krueger Concept. On 4 December 2002, Gerges approved the engineering layouts prepared by Hunt and asked Hunt to convert them into sales drawings.\\n\\n35 On 4 December 2002, Hunt prepared the sales drawings, depicting respectively, a 48ft dropdeck curtain-sided trailer with eight sliding side gates and a 53ft dropdeck curtain-sided trailer with nine sliding side gates, but without Krueger's standard copyright and confidentiality notice (\\\"the Initial Krueger Drawings\\\"). The drawings did, however, contain a prominent copyright symbol with the word \\\"Copyright\\\" immediately beneath it. Hunt provided them to Grant Krueger. The Initial Krueger Drawings are part of Annexure 1. The Initial Krueger Drawings bear the date 4 December 2002. Those drawings show at least eight posts along each side of the truck. Each post has attached to or \\\"hanging off\\\" from it a gate which, because of the gate's size and shape, acted as a load restraint for two pallets.\\n\\n44 Mr Michael Vawdrey gave evidence that his son Paul told him about the Cameron quote in the afternoon of 2 December 2002. Michael Vawdrey's evidence was that Paul told him that he , Paul, had suggested to Camerons that they use a post per pallet but that Camerons were concerned that this might not be sufficient and upon hearing this, he (Michael) suggested the hoops idea. There is no independent objective evidence that the conversation took place on that date. It is more probable than not that the conversation actually took place in the afternoon of 4 December, given the lack of any corroborating oral or documentary evidence to suggest that Vawdrey started working on a hoop design on that date and the affirmative evidence that Vawdrey was still proposing a non-hoop design as late as the afternoon of 4 December: see [51]. However, even taking Vawdrey's evidence at face value (ie that it was Michael Vawdrey who first suggested using hoops and that the suggestion originated on 2 December), it still undermines the Camerons and Vawdrey evidence that Paul Vawdrey, Cameron or Tindal had already suggested the Krueger Concept or even that there should be anything \\\"attached to or \\\"hanging off\\\" each post at the Cameron \\/ Vawdrey meeting earlier that day.\\n\\n45 On 3 December 2002 at 2.55pm, Mr Tindal sent to Mr Cameron a spreadsheet entitled \\\"FLEETSPEC.xls\\\". That document included a reference to Vawdrey's load restraint proposal of eleven posts comprising \\\"Sliding Side Posts: 9 of $4500\\\" in addition to the \\\"Side Posts: 2 Per Side Sliding\\\". (The spreadsheet did not include any details of the Second Krueger Quote because that second quote was not sent by Krueger to Camerons until it was included with the facsimile of 1.38pm on 4 December 2002.) Again, contrary to the evidence of Mr Cameron and Mr Tindal that they had already discussed with Vawdrey that the side posts would have something hanging off them, the spreadsheet did not describe anything hanging off the side posts.\\n\\n46 The events of 4 December 2002 are important. At about 11.55am, after speaking with his engineering group about the feasibility of the Krueger Concept, John Krueger telephoned Tindal on his mobile phone. The call lasted for approximately five minutes. Neither Tindal nor John Krueger was cross examined about the content of this conversation. According to John Krueger, he told Tindal that Krueger was confident that the concept would work and that a quotation and sales drawing would be sent to Camerons later that day. John Krueger's evidence was that he then asked Tindal whether any other manufacturer had provided Camerons with a concept that Camerons believed would work and Tindal told him that none had done so. Tindal did \\\"not recall what was discussed during [this] telephone conversation with John Krueger\\\". He did not deny the contents of the conversation as deposed to by John Krueger.\\n\\n124 An \\\"artistic work\\\" includes a \\\"drawing ... whether [the drawing] is of artistic quality or not\\\": s 10(1) of the Act . Each of the Krueger Sketch and the Krueger Drawings falls within the inclusive definition of a drawing, as each \\\"is a two-dimensional work in which shapes and images are depicted by lines, often without colouring\\\" ( Woodtree Pty Ltd v Zheng (2008) 74 IPR 484 , at [25]), performing a visual rather than \\\"semiotic\\\" function: Anacon Corporation Ltd v Environmental Research Technology Ltd [1994] FSR 659 at 662.
