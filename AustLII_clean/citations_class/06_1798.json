The Tribunal is conducting a review of the Delegate's decision but on the basis of the claims advanced and materials before the Tribunal. If a claim does not so arise and is abandoned, especially where the applicants are legally represented, the Tribunal is entitled to take the view that the applicants do not make that claim or a case based on that claim.\\n\\n35 The conclusion by Emmett FM that the claim to persecution on the ground of political opinion or imputed political opinion was abandoned and that the Tribunal was not obliged to consider it has not been shown to be in error.

As Branson J pointed out at [22], leave is required to argue on appeal an issue not raised below. There, as here, neither the appellant's written submissions nor his affidavit addressed the basis on which the Court must be satisfied that it is expedient and in the interests of justice for the issue to be raised for the first time on appeal. Her Honour said at [26] that it is not appropriate to grant an appellant leave to raise an issue simply because, as he contended, it would be just to allow him to do so. If the issue upon which an appellant wishes to rely for the first time is without merit, leave should not be granted to raise the issue before this Court.\\n\\n22 The affidavit contains general, broad assertions that the applicants' ' migration agent ' was ' undermining ' the case before the Tribunal, that the agent's behaviour was ' unethical ', that he had done ' damage ' to the applicants, had made submissions without instructions and had ' damaged the credibility of our refugee application immeasurably before the eyes of the Tribunal '. The male applicant said that he had not known what was being said, as the discussions were not interpreted.\\n\\n23 He also says that his counsel in the hearing before Emmett FM ' has disappointed us by advancing mostly unsustainable arguments with only one exception '.
