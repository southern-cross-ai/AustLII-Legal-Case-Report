Leave is necessary because the decision was delivered in respect of an interlocutory application: see s 24(1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).\\n\\nThe facts are set out in the May decision, and I will not repeat them at length here. In summary, the judgment related to an application to set aside two paragraphs of a notice to produce which had been issued on an application for preliminary discovery. The two paragraphs sought production of draft versions of a report produced by the respondent ('APRA') under s 60 of the Insurance Act 1973 (Cth). I set aside such paragraphs on two grounds: firstly, that the production of the documents was prohibited under s 56 of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Act 1998 (Cth) ('APRA Act'); and secondly, that the reports were not properly the subject of a notice to produce in an application for preliminary discovery under O 15A r 6 of the Federal Court Rules .\",\"1\":\"The principles relating to leave to appeal from an interlocutory judgment were discussed in Decor Corporation Pty Ltd and Anor v Dart Industries Inc (1991) 33 FCR 397 at 398-9. The Court there accepted that the major considerations in determining whether leave should be granted are: 1) whether the decision is attended by sufficient doubt to warrant its being reconsidered; and 2) whether substantial injustice would result if leave were to be refused, supposing the decision to be wrong. However, the Court in Decor added (at 399-400): \\n \\n 'However, there will continue to be cases raising special considerations, and the court should not regard its hands as tied in any case beyond this; that by s 24(1A) the legislature has evinced a policy against the bringing of interlocutory appeals except where the court, acting judicially, finds reason to grant leave. When the court comes to exercise its discretion on a particular application, an important distinction to be observed is that between the common interlocutory decision on a point of practice concerning which the High Court has given (see Adam P Brown Male Fashions Pty Ltd v Philip Morris Inc [1981] HCA 39 ; (1981) 148 CLR 170 at 177) a strong warning that \\\"a tight rein\\\" should be kept on appeals and an interlocutory decision determining a substantive right where leave will more readily be granted. '\\n\\nThe applicant submits that the May decision in respect of the operation of s 56(8) of the APRA Act is attended by sufficient doubt to warrant leave being granted. In the May decision, I held that s 56(8) of the APRA Act prevented disclosure of the draft reports to the Court. The applicant says the doubt arises because the issue is essentially a matter of statutory construction, and there is no other authority dealing with the issue. The applicant submits that the question involves resolving a tension between the apparent prohibition under the APRA Act and the rights of an applicant pursuant to the ADJR Act.\\n\\nThe respondent submits that there is clearly no doubt that the May decision is correct and that s 56(8) evinces a clear legislative intention to prohibit production of these documents. It submits that the purposes of the Insurance Act would be subverted if the documents were produced. It refers to s 125 of the Insurance Act which acknowledges that s 56 of the APRA Act prohibits certain disclosures of information under the Insurance Act .\",\"2\":\"The applicant further submits that there is a factual dispute between the parties relating to whether the applicant was subjected to differential treatment. The reports are sought for the purpose of providing evidence to support the applicant's claim. The applicant submits that the Full Federal Court decision in Tyco Australia Pty Ltd v Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd [2005] FCAFC 115 ; (2005) 142 FCR 428 is authority for the proposition that notices to produce may be issued in respect of factual disputes on preliminary discovery applications.\\n\\nIn the May decision, I found that there was no relevant factual dispute between the parties. I remain of the opinion that the 'factual dispute' alleged by the applicant is in fact a legal dispute about the effect of facts which are not in dispute, and that the sole purpose of the notice to produce is to elicit further facts on which it can rely and not to resolve any factual disagreement. Nonetheless, I accept that Hill J's judgment in Tyco does not explicitly address the nature and extent of factual disputes which would allow a notice to produce to be issued on an application for preliminary discovery. To my knowledge, there is no other significant authority on this issue and it is a question which is likely to arise in the future.\\n\\nI also accept the respondent's submission that, given the applicant's submission that it has sufficient information to substantiate O 15A r 6(a), it is difficult to see how the applicant could suffer any prejudice if leave to appeal were not granted with respect to the May decision on this point. Further, I consider that the question raised by the applicant on this point is a matter of procedure, for which leave would usually not be granted.\\n\\nIf leave were being sought upon this point alone, I would decline to grant leave. However, for the reasons expressed above, I consider it to be appropriate that leave be granted in respect of the s 56(8) point. If leave were granted on that point but not in relation to the notice to produce question, it would make the appeal before the Full Court an academic exercise, because the May decision would be ultimately unaffected regardless of the findings of the Full Court.\"}}"
