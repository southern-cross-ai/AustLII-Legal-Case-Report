Considerations relevant to the exercise of that discretion are:\\n \\n(i) whether in all the circumstances the judgment of the primary judge is attended by sufficient doubt to warrant it being reconsidered by the Full Court; and \\n \\n(ii) whether substantial injustice would result if leave were refused, supposing the decision were wrong. See: Harrington v Rich [2008] FCAFC 61 at [25] per Sackville, Emmett and Jacobson JJ.\\n\\n8 The proposed Grounds of Appeal as set out in the Draft Notice of Appeal are as follows (without alteration): \\n 1. Jurisdictional error 2. Breached of procedural fairness 3. Berached of natural justice \\nParticulars provided in respect of these grounds, as expressed in the Draft Notice of Appeal , state (without alteration):\\n 1.

I NEED A GOOD HEARING:\\n\\n9 It is considered that leave to appeal should be refused. A review of the reasons for decision of the Tribunal does not reveal any jurisdictional error, breach of procedural fairness or denial of natural justice.

The Federal Magistrate dismissed the proceedings before that Court pursuant to r 44.12(1)(a) of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 (Cth).\\n\\n4 Rule 44.12 of the 2001 Rules provides as follows: \\n Show cause hearing (1) At a hearing of an application for an order to show cause, the Court may: (a) if it is not satisfied that the application has raised an arguable case for the relief claimed -- dismiss the application; or (b) if it is satisfied that the application has raised an arguable case for the relief claimed -- adjourn the proceeding and order a respondent to show cause at a final hearing why an order for the relief claimed should not be made on such of the grounds mentioned in the application as are specified by the Court; or (c) without making an order under paragraph (b), make final orders in relation to the claims for relief and grounds mentioned in the application. (2) To avoid doubt, a dismissal under paragraph (1) (a) is interlocutory. \\nAs r 44.12(2) expressly provides, the dismissal of an application under r 44.12(1)(a) is an interlocutory decision.\\n\\n5 An appeal to this Court from an interlocutory decision of the Federal Magistrates Court requires leave: Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), s 24(1A).
