The applicant seeks an order prohibiting the learned member from making her decision and orders removing her from the conduct of the review. However, I refused to grant interlocutory relief which sought to prevent Senior Member Kelly from making her decision; see [2005] FCA 79. Leave to appeal from my judgment was refused by Hely J; see [2005] FCA 541. The request for such orders in the present proceedings has thus been overtaken by the publication of Senior Member Kelly's decision on 24 May 2005.\\n\\n167 Moreover, as Hely J observed in Lawrance v Administrative Appeals Tribunal [2005] FCA 541 at [39] there is an additional problem with the applicant's claim. A witness appearing before the AAT has the protection conferred by s 60(3) of the AAT Act . As his Honour said, the applicant's claim for an injunction would run counter to the immunity given by that section even if it were established that Ms Smith lied at the hearing before Senior Member Kelly.\\n\\n168 In any event, Senior Member Kelly accepted the evidence of Ms Smith. That was a finding of fact made within jurisdiction.\\n\\n169 The applicant asks me to make an order under s 50 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) that the Court suppress her name and refrain from publishing its decision in this matter.\",\"5\":\"46 Other requests for information in wide terms appear to have been made to the other relevant respondents; see Lawrance v Administrative Appeals Tribunal [2005] FCA 1318.\\n\\n47 On 8 March 2004, CRS replied to the applicant's request. CRS said:-\\n \\n \\\" - CRS Australia provides vocational rehabilitation, under the Disability Services Act (Cth) 1986. Vocational rehabilitation is a voluntary process and all CRS Australia vocational rehabilitation programs are provide (sic) in consultation with the client; \\n - CRS Australia does not conduct surveillance, and does not endorse the collection of personal information without the individual's knowledge and consent; \\n - Following searches of CRS Australia electronic records, using the details provided in your letter, I can confirm that CRS Australia has no record of you being a CRS Australia client, employee or contractor; \\n - If you had been a CRS Australia client at anytime between 1986 and 2004; an electronic record of your involvement with CRS Australia would have been made; \\n - CRS Australia does not hold personal or health information about individuals who are not CRS Australia clients, employees or contractors; \\n - All correspondence about clients, including correspondence via e-mail and facsimile, is kept in hard copy on the client's CRS Australia file.\\\"\\n\\n48 CRS concluded by saying that in accordance with s 24A of the FOI Act , CRS was unable to provide the information requested.

His Honour said that an order excluding the public may be more justified than an order excluding a party but that strict criteria govern the making of such an order. There must appear to be a real possibility of injustice to, or a serious disadvantage upon, a party or a witness or it must clearly appear that publication of the proceeding would be contrary to the public interest.\\n\\n124 Senior Member Allen took into account the embarrassment and damage which may flow to the applicant from publication.

There the Court was concerned with choice of law rules applicable in the County Court of Victoria in respect of a motor accident. The accident occurred in New South Wales between vehicles registered respectively in Victoria and New South Wales and driven respectively by Victorian and New South Wales resident drivers.\\n\\n165 The majority Justices observed at [33] that the County Court was exercising federal jurisdiction and that federal law controlled and required under s 80 of the Judiciary Act the applicable law. No such questions arise in the present case.\\n\\n166 Here, no debate as to whether there may be the excessive long-arm jurisdiction, which concerned Callinan J in dissent at [102], is triggered. This is a case in which no issue of federal jurisdiction is engaged by the complaints made against Ms Smith.\",\"13\":\"160 It is true that the applicant claims rights under Federal laws such as the DSA and that she claims breaches of rights or duties which owe their existence to Federal laws; see the discussion of the well established authorities in Transport Workers Union of Australia v Lee (1998) 84 FCR 60 at 65-67 (Black CJ, Ryan and Goldberg JJ).\",\"14\":\"156 Thus, although persons may be officers of the Commonwealth for some purposes, eg as employees of a government agency, that will be irrelevant where the impugned decision is that of the body corporate; see Vietnam Veterans' Affairs Association of Australia NSW Branch Inc v Cohen (1996) 70 FCR 419 at 432 per Tamberlin J; see also Aronson at 31.\\n\\n157 As Aronson states at 33, the main point of s 75(v) is to ensure judicial supervision of the execution of Commonwealth statutes and the exercise by the Commonwealth of common law and executive powers.\\n\\n158 Nothing which Ms Smith is said to have done falls within this description. She was summonsed by the applicant to give evidence on an application to review the decision of CRS to refuse access to documents. What Ms Smith said in the witness box, or in her statement given to CRS in connection with the application, had no connection whatsoever with her duties or functions as an officer of the Commonwealth. No issue of want of power or want of jurisdiction was in any way involved in Ms Smith's actions.\"}}"
