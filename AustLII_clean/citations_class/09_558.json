So understood, the proscribed conduct is more than mere negligence and must amount to gross carelessness.\\n\\nFor the Commissioner, it was contended that recklessness was established by the following considerations: \\n 34.1 the Applicant's signing of commercial documents without understanding the general effect that signing those documents would have; \\n\\n \\n 34.2 the Applicant's acceptance of her husband's advice to take certain actions, without independent enquiry of the effect of those actions; \\n\\n \\n 34.3 the applicant's accepting appointment as a director of a company which was trustee for a trust of which she was a beneficiary, the operations of which she professed little knowledge; \\n\\n \\n 34.4 her swearing of affidavit material without personal knowledge of the factual matters contained therein; \\n\\n \\n 34.5 vesting of trust assets of the Jancy Trust into a separate trust, without informing audit officers of that transaction.\\n\\nI am not prepared to infer that the appellant was reckless for the purposes of the imposition of additional tax under s 226H having regard to these considerations.\",\"1\":\"However further material then came to be filed subsequent to the hearing of the appeal (as to which see Carr v Finance Corporation of Australia (No 1) [1981] HCA 20 ; (1981) 147 CLR 246 per Mason J, as he then was, at 257-8 and Jackson v Conway [2000] FCA 1530 per Branson J at [29].

He also accepted, although as it subsequently transpired he should not have, that no submission, written or oral, was put below as to the absence of a basis for recklessness and moreover, that he did not even draw his Honour's attention to the allegedly live question of additional tax. He said that the matter was raised as an issue in the initiating application to the Court, although it seems it was not raised as an issue in the statement of facts, issues and contentions filed by the parties as part of the interlocutory processes.\\n If these were the only facts then, in my opinion, by the time the case came on for hearing before his Honour below, the issue of additional tax was no longer a live discrete issue; it may have remained an issue in name, but only on the basis that it stood or fell by reference to the outcome of the substantive issue.\\n While, on the hearing of the appeal, Senior Counsel for the appellant did not accept this view of the matter, he did accept that it would be more appropriately framed as an application for leave to agitate the issue rather than as a challenge to his Honour's disposition of the matter. I tend to agree and on those facts and concessions, I would not be prepared to grant leave.\\n However, following the hearing of the appeal, papers, including transcript below, were filed with the Court which indicate that the factual basis of the imposition of additional tax, namely recklessness, was still an issue so far as the appellant was concerned, even if the respondent and the Court thought otherwise....\",\"6\":\"The word \\\"false\\\" in the former s 223 means \\\"wrong\\\": Reliance Finance Corporation Pty Ltd v FCT (1987) 87 FLR 305.
