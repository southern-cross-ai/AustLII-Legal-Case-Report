He is required to establish special reasons for the extension within the principle stated by this Court in Jess v Scott (1986) 12 FCR 187 at 195.\\n\\nThe applicant explained the reasons for the delay. He filed an affidavit and sought to supplement his explanations in court this afternoon. He told me that he had no money to pay legal fees and that he needed the assistance of a friend to prepare his notice of appeal.\\n\\nThe exercise of the discretion to extend time is to take into account not only the reason for the delay but the question of whether the proposed appeal has sufficient prospects of success to warrant an extension of time.\"}}"
