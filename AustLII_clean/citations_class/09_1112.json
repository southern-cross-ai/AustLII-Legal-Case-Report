The nature and timing of the applications before me provide some of the context for my consideration of the present application. I shall briefly refer to some matters of history later in these Reasons.\\n\\nOn 21 September 2009, Ms Monnox, who is the solicitor for the respondents, telephoned Mr Tzovaras, who is the solicitor for the appellant, and inquired of him as to whether the security for costs ordered by me was going to be provided and, if so, when. Mr Tzovaras' response was noncommittal. In effect, he did not inform Ms Monnox of any concrete proposal concerning the provision of the security.\\n\\nOn 22 September 2009, Ms Monnox followed up Mr Tzovaras who was at that time unavailable. She left a message for him to contact her urgently. Mr Tzovaras did not respond. Later that day, Ms Monnox wrote a letter to Mr Tzovaras in which she pointed out that the security had not been provided as ordered. She drew Mr Tzovaras' attention to the fact that her clients' undertakings not to enforce the judgment debts were now extinguished and that the respondents proposed to issue creditor's statutory demands to the appellant in respect of the judgment debts which each of the respondents had against the appellant. In that letter she also foreshadowed an application that the appeal be dismissed for want of prosecution. In that letter, Ms Monnox made very clear that she was instructed to take steps to have the appeal dismissed.\\n\\nThe appellant originally sought leave to appeal from the decision of Rares J because it believed that that decision was not a final judgment. After argument, I made orders on 22 July 2009 granting leave to appeal from the decision of Rares J should that leave be necessary and extending the time within which a Notice of Appeal could be filed in the event that, as I thought, the judgment of Rares J was in fact a final judgment (see Austcorp International Limited v Owers [2009] FCA 774).\",\"1\":\"The appellant originally sought leave to appeal from the decision of Rares J because it believed that that decision was not a final judgment.

A similar approach should be taken to the power to dismiss an appeal pursuant to s 56(4). The Court should have regard to all of the circumstances of the case in exercising its discretion.\",\"3\":\"I have already referred to the relevant circumstances in some detail, and it seems to me that, in the absence of any attempt at all by the appellant to explain itself or to provide assistance to the Court as to when security might be provided, the only appropriate course is for me to dismiss the appeal pursuant to s 56(4) of the Federal Court Act. As Hely J said in Truth about Motorways Pty Ltd v Macquarie Infrastructure Investment Management Ltd [2001] FCA 1603: \\n \\n It is a serious thing to terminate proceedings when there has not been a hearing on the merits. \\n \\n\\n \\nBut in circumstances where there has been an unexplained failure to comply with an order of the Court, which itself was made in the circumstances which I have outlined, it seems to me that the proper exercise of the Court's discretion is to make the orders sought.\\n\\nAccordingly, pursuant to s 56(4) of the Federal Court Act, I dismiss the appeal and I order the appellant to pay the costs of the respondents of and incidental to the Notice of Motion filed by the respondents on 23 September 2009 and of the appeal. I also order that, to the extent necessary, the respondents be released from the undertaking given to the Court and noted in paragraph 8 in the orders of the Court made on 12 August 2009. I should add that my present view is that that undertaking became spent according to its terms when the appellant failed to provide the security for the respondents' costs of the appeal which it had been ordered to provide, that is to say, at 4.00 pm on 21 September 2009. \\n I certify that the preceding twenty (20) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Foster. \\n \\n Associate:\\n \\n \\nDated: 1 October 2009\\n \\n Solicitor for the Appellant: Mr D Riedstra (Agent for Tzovaras Legal) \\n \\n Solicitor for the Respondents: Ms C Monnox of Maurice Blackburn Pty Limited \\n Date of Hearing: 30 September 2009 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 30 September 2009 \\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2009\\/1112.html\"}}"
