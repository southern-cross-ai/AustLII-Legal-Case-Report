Causal connection is sometimes inferred from access to the copyright work in suit and sufficient objective similarity between it and the work said to infringe. But the two elements are conceptually distinct: a young child may try to copy a drawing, yet fail, for lack of skill, to reproduce it; a skilful copier may attempt to copy a work on the basis of his or her recollection of it, yet fail for imperfection of memory; a chain of communications from the observer of a work to the ultimate author of an intended copy of it may be so defective that, again, the intended copy fails to reproduce the original. But even a perfect copy, if truly accidental and independent, is also not a 'reproduction', because the necessary causal link between the two works is missing: cf Ladbroke at 276 per Lord Reid; Eagle at [85], [86]. \\n \\n [45] Tamawood concedes that there can be an infringement although the author did not directly copy from, or even know of , the copyright work. The primary judge cited, in this connection, LED at 225, but that case did not go so far as Tamawood 's concession does. In LED , a director of the alleged infringer gave instructions to its drafters for modifications to be made to bring plans into line with the copyright plans of the applicant. The comparable situation in the circumstances of the present case would be that Mr Mizikovsky filled Ms Gould's role, that is to say, that he, as an officer of Tamawood, and knowing of the Chirnside plan and intending to take from it , gave the unsuspecting Mr Middleton instructions for modifications to the Adrian, which, in fact, when implemented, would bring it into line with the Chirnside. On his Honour's findings, that is not this case. \\n \\n [46] The primary judge expressed (at [42]) surprise at a statement in Eagle (at [86]) that 'where subjective copying occurs there can be expected to be found an infringement, unless it transpires that the product is so dissimilar to the copyright work that the copyright work can no longer be seen in the work produced'. Referring to an expectation, that statement allows for exceptions. Also it must be read in context. As stated earlier in the judgment (at [72]) Eagle was better regarded as a case of reproduction of the whole of the copyright work, so it was strictly not necessary to undertake the 'substantial part' inquiry. Eagle was a case of subjective copying of the shapes and arrangement of, and interrelationship between rooms, and of traffic flow, throughout the house. The statement which surprised his Honour is akin to that of Lord Bingham in Designers Guild Ltd v Russell William (Textiles) Ltd [2001] FSR 113 (' Designers Guild' ) that: \\n \\n \\n \\n '[w]hile the finding of copying did not in theory conclude the issue of substantiality, on the facts here [Designers Guild was also a case of overall similarity] it was almost bound to do so.' (at 116-117) \\n \\n \\n \\n It was acknowledged several times elsewhere in the judgment in Eagle (at [69], [74] and [103], for example) that subjective copying alone is not enough, and that where a part is taken it must be a substantial part of the copyright work. (Peterson J's aphorism, 'what is worth copying is prima facie worth protecting', a statement made in University of London Press Ltd v University Tutorial Press Ltd [1916] 2 Ch 601 at 610 in relation to the subsistence of copyright, was in fact invoked in the context of infringement and 'substantial part' in Ladbroke by Lord Reid at 279 and by Lord Pearce at 293-294, but the House of Lords may be taken to have cautioned against this practice in Designers Guild ).\\\"\\n\\n69 In the absence of any direct evidence of copying, or access by the respondent to the applicant's work, the causal link can be inferred. The greater the degree of objective similarity, the more likely it will be that that inference will be drawn: SW Hart & Co v Edwards Hot Water Systems (at 472); Clarendon Homes v Henley Arch and Barrett Property Group Pty Ltd v Carlisle Homes Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 375 .\\n\\n71 Determining whether \\\"a substantial part of the work\\\" has been reproduced is a question of fact and degree. As indicated, greater weight must be given to the quality of what is reproduced than to its quantity: SW Hart & Co v Edwards Hot Water Systems. The protected element may arise out of a combination of elements, any one of which considered individually might not qualify as sufficiently original to attract copyright. An allegation of substantial reproduction will be made out if what has been taken is an essential or material part of the applicant's work: Autodesk Inc v Dyason [No 2] [1993] HCA 6 ; (1993) 176 CLR 300 per Mason CJ at 305; Tamawood v Henley Arch at [52]; and Dixon Investments Pty Ltd v Hall (1990) 18 IPR 490 at 494 per Lockhart, Spender and Ryan JJ .\",\"2\":\"62 Copying can be conscious or subconscious: Clarendon Homes (Aust) Pty Ltd v Henley Arch Pty Ltd (1999) 46 IPR 309 at [24].

In LED Builders Pty Ltd v Eagle Homes Pty Ltd (1996) 35 IPR 215 , there were differences in room sizes, window placings, wall alignments, and cupboards between the plans of the applicant and respondent. Nonetheless, these differences were minor and there was found to be reproduction of a substantial part of the applicant's plans.\\n\\n65 Davies J found that the respondent did not ask its draftsmen to copy the applicant's plans. The respondent gave instructions to change the respondent's existing plans, both by way of sketches and orally, which, when implemented, would bring those plans into line with the applicant's plans. This was said to constitute deliberate copying, though achieved by the giving of instructions for change rather than the direct tracing of one plan from another. There was thus a causal connection between the two sets of plans.\\n\\n93 In support of its argument, Inform noted Davies J's comments in LED Builders v Eagle Homes , in which he said (at 217): \\n \\\"What stands out is that the overall positioning, orientation, and designs of the rooms, of the entry and of the garage are practically identical. So also is the general relationship between the house and its environs. Note that in each case, the garage is in the same position in LED's and Eagle's comparable drawings, notwithstanding that the garage in drawings A1 and A2 is situated differently from the garage in drawings B1 and B2.\\\"\\n\\n116 Inform contended that the authorities were careful to point out that the conceptual limits of project home copyright should not be overstated: Eagle Homes v Austec Homes ; LED v Eagle Homes and Clarendon Homes v Henley Arch, Tamawood v Henley Arch and Barrett Property Group v Metricon Homes . It noted that copyright protection had been given to the combination and arrangement of rooms and spaces in a design and the \\\"flow\\\" or movement and other aspects arising from that arrangement and associated design choices (eg Eagle Homes v Austec Homes).\",\"4\":\"66 An important case for present purposes is Tamawood Ltd v Henley Arch Pty Ltd (2004) 61 IPR 378. It also concerned copyright in project home designs. The trial judge found that copyright had been infringed. On appeal, Wilcox and Lindgren JJ in a joint judgment observed in relation to copyright and project homes generally: \\n \\n \\\"[38] The application of the law of copyright to project home plans gives rise to special difficulty. All modern homes have certain features in common. In the case of project homes competing for the same number of dollars, there are pressures towards sameness. Of course, the size, number of rooms and facilities will vary according to the price range. Commonly, however, those in the same price range will be found: \\n (a) to be designed to fit blocks of approximately similar shape and dimensions; \\n (b) to provide for vehicular access and accommodation; and \\n (c) to include features demanded by the market in question, such as, a certain number of bedrooms, a laundry, a kitchen, a family or rumpus room, an ensuite and a walk-in wardrobe ('WIR') in association with the main bedroom, built-in wardrobes in the other bedrooms, at least one bathroom in proximity to the other bedrooms, and certain facilities in the kitchen such as a sink, bench, dishwasher, stove, hot plate and microwave oven. \\n \\n [39] The idea-form distinction, often elusive, is particularly so in the case of project homes. Yet the originality threshold for copyright protection is low. It is no longer challenged that copyright subsisted in the Chirnside Works and Buildings, as well as in the Baltimore Works and Buildings. \\n \\n [40] Although copyright subsists in the whole of a plan or house, this does not mean that each individual part of it, considered in isolation, satisfies the originality test for the subsistence of copyright, that is to say, that it originated with the author. Some parts may be original only in the sense that they are part of a whole which did originate with the author. So, Lord Pearce was able to say that to copy an unoriginal part of a copyright whole is not an infringement: cf Ladbroke (Football) Ltd v William Hill (Football) Ltd [1964] 1 WLR 273 (\\\"Ladbroke\\\") per Lord Pearce at 293. \\n \\n [41] The taking of an idea, as distinct from its expression, from a copyright work will also not constitute an infringement, since there is no copyright in ideas: cf Kenrick & Co v Lawrence & Co (1890) 25 QBD 99 ( \\\"Kenrick\\\" ). Common examples concern objects in the real world or ideas based on objects in the real world. A person who draws or photographs an object does not, through the copyright in the drawing or photograph, become entitled to prevent others from drawing or photographing the same object, even though there may be a striking similarity between the two drawings or between the two photographs. The drawing of plans for project homes involves a mixture of the use of familiar ideas based on objects in the real world (many other project homes and the plans for them) on the one hand, and labour, skill and judgment (in combining and arranging the various parts) on the other hand. It may be possible to say of each individual part, considered in isolation, that it merely expresses a common idea, yet there will be copyright in the whole plan if the combination and arrangement originated with the author. In protecting that origination, copyright protects the author's labour, skill and judgment. \\n \\n [42] It is reasonable to expect that the more simple, commonplace, familiar and straightforward the subject matter of a copyright work, the closer the similarity that will be required if infringement is to be found: cf Kenrick at 102.\\\"\\n\\n68 What is clear from Clarendon Homes v Henley Arch, and Tamawood v Henley Arch in particular , as well as the other cases cited, is that in order to prove infringement of copyright there must be proof of copying. As indicated, copying can be deliberate or subconscious although, as the Full Court observed in Clarendon Homes v Henley Arch at [24], in cases involving works such as architectural plans, it would be surprising to find many cases of subconscious copying. If a person independently creates a work that is substantially similar or even identical to another in which copyright subsists, the copyright holder has no recourse: Eagle Homes Pty Ltd v Austec Homes Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 138 ; (1999) 87 FCR 415 at [86] per Lindgren J.\\n\\n71 Determining whether \\\"a substantial part of the work\\\" has been reproduced is a question of fact and degree. As indicated, greater weight must be given to the quality of what is reproduced than to its quantity: SW Hart & Co v Edwards Hot Water Systems. The protected element may arise out of a combination of elements, any one of which considered individually might not qualify as sufficiently original to attract copyright. An allegation of substantial reproduction will be made out if what has been taken is an essential or material part of the applicant's work: Autodesk Inc v Dyason [No 2] [1993] HCA 6 ; (1993) 176 CLR 300 per Mason CJ at 305; Tamawood v Henley Arch at [52]; and Dixon Investments Pty Ltd v Hall (1990) 18 IPR 490 at 494 per Lockhart, Spender and Ryan JJ .\\n\\n75 Inform submitted that this objective similarity was a matter of impression for the Court to undertake as a lay observer. That there were differences between the relevant Inform and Boutique plans was to be expected and was in no way determinative. In relation to what it termed the \\\"legacy features\\\", which could be seen as carrying over from the Villa Grand to the Villa View, Inform noted that the question was addressed in Tamawood v Henley Arch. In that case, Wilcox and Lindgren JJ concluded that such features should be \\\"subtracted\\\" from the assessment of what had been reproduced. However, Moore J, in his dissenting judgment, reached the conclusion that they should not.\\n\\n76 Notwithstanding this, Inform said that a number of key features not present in the Villa Grand could be seen to have been introduced into the Villa View, which reproduced \\\"with remarkable fidelity\\\" features from the Seasons. They were:\\n \\n\\u2022 the relocation and orientation of the staircase;\\n \\n\\u2022 the redesign of the hallway space and spine on the ground floor;\\n \\n\\u2022 the cleaner line between hall and dining space at front of the house with no columns and reduced articulation of the separation between that room and the hallway;\\n \\n\\u2022 the placement of the study at the front of the house;\\n \\n\\u2022 the shift forward of the garage;\\n \\n\\u2022 the 'straighter' alignment of the front of the house with the garage;\\n \\n\\u2022 the arrangement of the downstairs laundry and toilet 'wet areas' around the stair, which have the same 'footprint' on the two plans, although the disposition of the laundry and toilet within the footprint is varied;\\n \\n\\u2022 the arrangement upstairs of the bathrooms and toilet around the stairway;\\n \\n\\u2022 the rearrangement of the children's bedrooms in a cluster at the rear without separation by a bathroom;\\n \\n\\u2022 the introduction of the island bedhead\\/wardrobe in the master bedroom; and\\n \\n\\u2022 the spatial arrangement and disposition of en suite bathroom, robe and master bedroom.\\n\\n77 Even subtracting the \\\"legacy features\\\" from the Villa Grand that were present in the Villa View design, and allowing for the slight differences in dimension and arrangement of some of the spaces, Inform argued that there remained a striking similarity between the Villa View and Inform's Seasons and Urban plans.\\n\\n88 As noted above, copyright subsists in the work as a whole. It will be infringed if a \\\"substantial part\\\" of the work is reproduced, though no separate copyright is conferred on that part. As was noted in Tamawood v Henley Arch, the critical question will be whether the part or parts taken represented a substantial part of the labour, skill and judgment of the author that made the whole work \\\"original\\\". Plainly, this involves questions of degree.\\n\\n89 As indicated above, Inform relied on the evidence of Mr Meyer and Mr Wines to submit that a number of features, which were material, essential or important parts of the Urban and Seasons designs, are found in the Villa View. Of these features, the most significant is the arrangement of a centralized staircase in proximity to a \\\"core\\\" of wet areas with living area and bedrooms then arranged around that core. Inform submitted that this aspect of the design of the Seasons and Urban was of key qualitative significance.\\n\\n90 Despite Mr Rivette's suggestions in cross-examination that the central staircase, and arrangement of wet areas around it, were unremarkable features in commercial design, Inform contended that Boutique had not been able to offer any evidence of these features forming part of the \\\"common stock\\\" in project housing before the Urban and Seasons. \\nInform noted how the central stair in the Urban and Seasons could have been pushed further forwards or backwards in the buildings or rotated to face the front or rear. Its placement where it was represented a concrete choice by Mr Meyer from which other choices, such as the subsequent arrangement of surrounding rooms, flowed. Similarly, Inform contended, the arrangement of the wet areas around the stairs had no functional or cost benefits but was simply a choice made from many which were available. This was also true of the separation and arrangement of the downstairs meals and living rooms and the upstairs rooms around the core. Inform said that, despite Boutique's attempts to portray these aspects of the design of the Inform homes as being the result of the requirements of building on narrow blocks and satisfying building codes, this was not the case.\\n\\n94 In addition it drew attention to the comments of Wilcox and Lindgren JJ in Tamawood v Henley Arch, in which their Honours said (at [89]) : \\n \\\"It would be tedious to attempt to identify the most important features of the Chirnside which were taken. In our opinion, cumulatively, they constituted a substantial part of the Chirnside. As between the Chirnside and the Adrian, the parts of the Chirnside that were taken were \\\"distinctively\\\" Chirnside. We regard: \\n \\n \\u2022 the absence of protrusions from bedroom 1 and bedroom 2 and of diagonal walls and hampers between the dining and living areas; \\n \\u2022 the glassed conservatory-style meals area between the rumpus room and the kitchen; \\n \\u2022 the lack of diagonal walls and hamper between the rumpus and family rooms; \\n \\u2022 the glass walls of the rumpus room; and \\n \\u2022 the absence of a door and built-in wardrobe of bedroom 5\\/study, \\n \\nas essential and material non-functional parts of the Chirnside, regarded as an artistic work, that were copied. We prefer, however, to say that all of the items which we have concluded were taken from the Chirnside, when regarded cumulatively, amount to a substantial part of the Chirnside.\\\"\\n\\n95 In reply, Boutique submitted that even if I found that there had been copying, it would still not have infringed Inform's copyright. It submitted that any such copying, assuming it had occurred, was not done in relation to a \\\"substantial part\\\" of Inform's work.\\n\\n97 Boutique submitted that in considering whether a \\\"substantial part\\\" of Inform's work had been reproduced, I should bear in mind the observations of Wilcox and Lindgren JJ in Tamawood v Henley Arch at [56]:\\n \\n \\\"Placing a kitchen in reasonable proximity to a dining room, and bedrooms in reasonable proximity to each other and to a bathroom is suggested by broad functional considerations. Those proximities would not be a substantial part of a plan or house regarded as an artistic work. Moreover, they would be ideas. But broad functional requirements can be satisfied in more ways than one. Some features of the project home plan may be dictated by aesthetics and decorative concerns, for example. In these ways, the labour, skill and judgment of the author are called upon. The dividing line between that which is dictated by broad functional requirements and that which is not, is, however, often unclear.\\\"\\n\\n98 Boutique submitted that in order to determine whether the relevant causal connection was established, the Court had to identify that part of Inform's work that was the subject of copying, whether consciously or subconsciously. In that regard, Inform's case was that the essential features of its Urban and Seasons designs that were reproduced were those set out by its counsel in his opening, namely:\\n \\n\\u2022 a long narrow rectangular plan forming a \\\"spine\\\" to the building;\\n \\n\\u2022 a centrally positioned free-standing staircase;\\n \\n\\u2022 minimized hallway space downstairs and upstairs;\\n \\n\\u2022 creation of a central services \\\"core\\\" around the stairwell ie placement of the kitchen adjacent to the stairwell but not abutting a permitter wall;\\n \\n\\u2022 placement of other \\\"service\\\" areas such as laundry powder room and en suite bathroom around the stairwell;\\n \\n\\u2022 placement of living and bedrooms around the core in zones;\\n \\n\\u2022 master bedroom at front of house, forward of stairs (upstairs) with an island style bedhead\\/robe;\\n \\n\\u2022 rumpus room and children's rooms upstairs at rear;\\n \\n\\u2022 arrangement of the children's rooms;\\n \\n\\u2022 arrangement of bathrooms upstairs;\\n \\n\\u2022 open informal living spaces on ground floor with visual floor to rear of house;\\n \\n\\u2022 a meals area extending into the yard creating a courtyard effect with garage;\\n \\n\\u2022 a garage arranged to side of the house;\\n \\n\\u2022 fa&ccedil;ade\\/elevation arrangements designed to break down the visual and spatial massing of the building; and\\n \\n\\u2022 a relatively low pitch roofline.\\n\\n99 Boutique submitted that many of these features were either mere ideas or common to all project homes. It will be recalled that in Tamawood v Henley Arch, the Court observed (at [38]) that the application of the law of copyright to project home plans gave rise to special difficulty. All modern homes had certain features in common and, in the case of project homes competing for the \\\"same number of dollars\\\", there were pressures towards sameness. See also Eagle Homes v Austec Homes at [80] per Lindgren J . In Henley Arch Pty Ltd v Clarendon Homes (Aust) Pty Ltd (1998) 41 IPR 443 , Merkel J (at 460) went so far as to suggest that the degree of the protection under copyright of an architectural plan might be limited by reason of the proportion of features common to all plans.\\n\\n101 For functional reasons, kitchens are normally located in reasonable proximity to dining areas. For similar reasons, in a two-level home, bedrooms are usually positioned upstairs in reasonable proximity to each other. In Tamawood v Henley Arch, the Court observed (at [56]) that proximities such as these would not be a substantial part of any plan or house regarded as an artistic work. Moreover, they would be ideas and not the expression of ideas.\\n\\n102 Boutique argued that the design of project homes was invariably dictated by features such as the size and shape of the block of land available, the requirements of Rescode (the planning scheme provisions applying to residential developments in Victoria), local government requirements, and cost considerations.\\n\\n103 Inform conceded that many of the features identified by Boutique as common to project homes were present in the Villa Grand 35 plan, to which Inform took no exception. Indeed, a number of those features were present in the earlier Mawson Lakes home as well. Boutique submitted that these pre-existing elements had to be excluded from any analysis of what may have been derived from Inform's work. In Tamawood v Henley Arch, Wilcox and Lindgren JJ said at [64]:\\n \\n \\\"Obviously, it is important in considering the similarities between the Gould and Chirnside plans, to discount the pre-existing similarities between the Chirnside and the Adrian: the Gould was 'based' on the Adrian, not the Chirnside.\\\"\\n\\n104 Boutique argued that when one excluded these common and pre-existing features, all that was left was the central core of the Urban and Seasons, that being the staircase and its position in the house with the wet services area around it. In that regard, even Mr Wines conceded that a central staircase was hardly novel. Moreover, a staircase that folds back on itself has been around for centuries. Mr Meyer acknowledged that such a staircase was quite standard and that the structure of a staircase that wrapped around a blade wall or balustrade was not uncommon in 1999 when he designed the Core house. He agreed that the staircase in the Villa View differed from that used in the Urban and Seasons in that it did not appear to wrap around a blade wall, but rather a balustrade.\\n\\n105 Mr Wines accepted that commercial and high-rise properties often had wet service areas surrounding the vertical core. He accepted that this concept had been adopted by both Inform and Boutique and that it made good sense as an economy measure. He agreed that the wet areas were configured above each other in the Villa Grand and that this same approach had been taken in the design of the Villa View. Mr Meyer accepted that other architects or designers might have been using a central staircase with serviced wet areas surrounding it at the time that he designed the Core house in 1999.\",\"5\":\"68 What is clear from Clarendon Homes v Henley Arch, and Tamawood v Henley Arch in particular , as well as the other cases cited, is that in order to prove infringement of copyright there must be proof of copying.

Although questions of \\\"substantiality\\\" and \\\"reproduction\\\" are ultimately for the Court to determine, it is permissible and of assistance to have regard to expert opinion to resolve those questions: Ancher, Mortlock, Murray & Woolley Pty Ltd v Hooker Homes Pty Ltd [1971] 2 NSWLR 278 at 286 and Barrett Property Group v Metricon Homes at [28].\\n\\n99 Boutique submitted that many of these features were either mere ideas or common to all project homes.

In Eagle Homes v Austec Homes, Lindgren J pointed out the importance in that case of the primary judge's finding that there had been subjective copying. His Honour said (at [92]):\\n \\n \\\"To insist that a copyright owner can satisfy the sufficient objective similarity of reproduction only by establishing such a close similarity is a hurdle too high to be placed before a copyright owner who is found to have proved subjective copying. The way of the copier, including the copier of a plan of a project home, should not be made easy.\\\"\\n\\n113 Boutique submitted that it was in the light of findings of deliberate copying that both Eagle Homes v Austec Homes and Barrett Property Group v Metricon Homes (affirmed on appeal: Metricon Homes Pty Ltd v Barrett Property Group Pty Ltd [2008] FCAFC 46) should be viewed. In a case involving at its highest an allegation of subconscious reproduction, a close objective similarity in the detail of the two plans should be required before there could be any finding that a substantial part had been taken.\\n\\n116 Inform contended that the authorities were careful to point out that the conceptual limits of project home copyright should not be overstated: Eagle Homes v Austec Homes ; LED v Eagle Homes and Clarendon Homes v Henley Arch, Tamawood v Henley Arch and Barrett Property Group v Metricon Homes . It noted that copyright protection had been given to the combination and arrangement of rooms and spaces in a design and the \\\"flow\\\" or movement and other aspects arising from that arrangement and associated design choices (eg Eagle Homes v Austec Homes).\",\"6\":\"69 In the absence of any direct evidence of copying, or access by the respondent to the applicant's work, the causal link can be inferred. The greater the degree of objective similarity, the more likely it will be that that inference will be drawn: SW Hart & Co v Edwards Hot Water Systems (at 472); Clarendon Homes v Henley Arch and Barrett Property Group Pty Ltd v Carlisle Homes Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 375 .\\n\\n91 Inform said that the placement of the central stair with the wet areas around it, and the interrelationship of these design features to the remaining spaces of the house, were at least as substantial to the overall design as was the al fresco quadrant in Barrett Property v Carlisle Homes . In that case, the Court held that an al fresco quadrant, which comprised a combination of rumpus, family, kitchen and meals areas around an open courtyard enclosed on three sides, all under a single roof, was a substantial part of the design.\\n\\n92 Inform said that Courts had been ready, sometimes implicitly, to find particular design features, and the layout and interrelationship of rooms in plans, as constituting a substantial part. Moreover, they had regularly stopped short of finding it necessary to list or define the elements as constituting a substantial part, which was consistent with the role that subjective impression had to play in the process.\",\"7\":\"70 The operative similarity need not be, and indeed rarely will be, to the entire work. However, correspondence to a substantial part of the applicant's design will be sufficient to ground infringement: Barrett Property Group Pty Ltd v Metricon Homes Pty Ltd (2007) 74 IPR 52 . It is not necessary to show that the alleged copy is a perfect reproduction of a substantial part of the applicant's work: British Northrop Ltd v Texteam Blackburn Ltd [1974] RPC 57 at 72 per Megarry J.\",\"8\":\"70 The operative similarity need not be, and indeed rarely will be, to the entire work.

Although questions of \\\"substantiality\\\" and \\\"reproduction\\\" are ultimately for the Court to determine, it is permissible and of assistance to have regard to expert opinion to resolve those questions: Ancher, Mortlock, Murray & Woolley Pty Ltd v Hooker Homes Pty Ltd [1971] 2 NSWLR 278 at 286 and Barrett Property Group v Metricon Homes at [28].\\n\\n121 Boutique referred to Ancher, Mortlock, Murray & Woolley Pty Ltd v Hooker Homes Pty Ltd where Street J said (at 284):\\n \\n \\\"An architect may legitimately inspect an original plan or house and then, having absorbed the architectural concept and appreciated the architectural style represented therein, return to his own drawing board and apply that concept and style to an original plan prepared by him and in due course to a house built to such plan. There is a dividing line separating such a legitimate process from an inspection followed by a later copying of a substantial part of the physical object inspection, even though the copying be from memory; the latter exercise does infringe. In many instances it will be difficult to state categorically whether the dividing line has been crossed. Cases will not always be black or white where the alleged coping is from memory. The borderline area is clouded by a band of grey within which opinions and conclusions may differ. Within this grey band conflicting answers could without error be given to the questions is that plan or house only a copy of the concept or style of the original and hence legitimate?, or is it a copy of the author's manifestation of that concept or style and hence an infringement?\\\"\\n\\n122 Despite the significant body of evidence led in this case, and the copious citation of authority, the real dispute between the parties turns largely upon a simple question of fact. Has Inform established by reliance upon inference that those involved in the design and construction of the Villa View copied central elements of the Urban or Seasons?\\n\\n123 Inform's case turns primarily upon subconscious rather than deliberate copying. It does not invite me to find that any of Mr Di Natale, Mr de Weerd, Mr O'Dwyer or Mr Lazarovski has given untruthful evidence as such. Rather, it submits that it is simply inconceivable that two such similar designs as the Seasons and Villa View could have been independently arrived at. It says that someone associated with the design of the Villa View must have seen and digested the essential features of either or both of the Urban or Seasons, each of which achieved considerable publicity at about the time the Villa View was being planned. The seeds of the Inform designs must have been planted in the minds of those who conceived the Villa View and influenced the design of that home. Inform says that any other conclusion would strain the bounds of credulity.\\n\\n124 Weighed against that view is the emphatic evidence given by Mr Di Natale, Mr de Weerd, and Mr Lazarovski in particular, denying any knowledge of the Urban or Seasons at the time in question. Their evidence is supported by a detailed documentary trail, which shows the evolution of the different Boutique homes from the one at Mawson Lakes to the various Villa Grand versions, including the Contemporary Villa Grand, and ultimately the Villa View. That evidence, which included transparencies of the plans of each of these homes, was said to controvert Mr Wine's opinion to the extent that he did not resile from it in any event under cross-examination.\\n\\n125 It was Oscar Wilde who said in The Importance of Being Earnest :\\n \\n \\\"To lose one parent ... may be regarded as a misfortune; to lose both looks like carelessness.\\\"\",\"12\":\"96 It noted that in Ladbroke (Football) Ltd v William Hill (Football) [1964] 1 WLR 273 , Lord Pearce said (at 293): \\n \\n \\\"Whether a part is substantial must be decided by its quality rather than its quantity. The reproduction of a part which by itself has no originality will not normally be a substantial part of the copyright and therefore will not be protected. For that which would not attract copyright except by reason of its collocation will, when robbed of that collocation, not be a substantial part of the copyright and therefore the courts will not hold its reproduction to be an infringement. It is this, I think, which is meant by one or two judicial observations that 'there is no copyright' in some unoriginal part of a whole that is copyright'.\\\"\",\"13\":\"99 Boutique submitted that many of these features were either mere ideas or common to all project homes. It will be recalled that in Tamawood v Henley Arch, the Court observed (at [38]) that the application of the law of copyright to project home plans gave rise to special difficulty. All modern homes had certain features in common and, in the case of project homes competing for the \\\"same number of dollars\\\", there were pressures towards sameness.

It does not prevent the development and expansion of ideas or the furtherance of architectural concepts: Clarendon Homes v Henley Arch at [16]. To constitute an infringement, the act must constitute an unauthorised use of the form of the work and not merely its idea or theme or method.\\n\\n115 Inform's submissions on this point were not detailed. It noted that in cases involving architectural designs, broad design concepts were not subject to protection but their form, as found in a given design, was if they were neither mere copies nor entirely generic concepts. Inform conceded that with project homes, the idea\\/expression dichotomy could be harder to distinguish because of the degree to which function dictated form and the fact that such homes were often composed of stock elements common to the genre. However, Inform submitted that such concerns had limited application in this case because the Urban and Seasons designs were not \\\"run-of-the-mill variants\\\" of standard project home lines.\"}}"
