He further contends that, in any event, as the Tribunal made no relocation finding, no issue arises in connection with whether the Tribunal assessed the issue of relocation properly.\\n\\n27 With respect to the second ground of appeal, the first respondent submits that the decision to refuse the adjournment application by the Federal Magistrate was made in the exercise of his discretion as trial judge. It was contended that the decision was open to the Federal Magistrate.\\n\\n29 The first respondent is correct in contending the first ground of appeal was not raised before the Federal Magistrate and, therefore, the appellants require leave: NAJT [2005] FCAFC 134 ; 147 FCR 51. No explanation has been given for the failure to raise this matter in the Federal Magistrates Court. The appellant, of course, was unrepresented both before the Federal Magistrates Court and this Court. In order to determine whether leave should be granted to the appellants to raise this ground on appeal, I shall shortly consider the merits of the ground. As the first respondent asserts, in order to attack any finding of the Tribunal on issues of relocation, there must first be a finding. There was no finding because the question of relocation never arose. It would only have arisen if the appellant had made out his primary contention that the applicant had a well-founded fear of persecution if he were to return to India. I accept, as the first respondent contends, that because the Tribunal made no relocation finding this ground raises no relevant issues on appeal. Leave must be refused.\\n\\n30 In relation to the second ground of appeal, although it is desirable that applicants in these cases be represented where possible, it is not a matter of right. The Federal Magistrate refused the adjournment application on the grounds that no satisfactory explanation was provided for the late request for the adjournment and that the lack of merits in the case did not warrant any further delay in the matter. No error has been shown in the Federal Magistrate's exercise of discretion. For that reason, this ground also fails. The decision of SZFDE [2007] HCA 35 is not relevant to this ground.\",\"2\":\"28 In relation to the third ground of appeal, the first respondent submits that there was no error in the Federal Magistrate's decision, as the appellants were provided with a s 424A letter.
