Cartel conduct can take many different forms. On the one hand, it may be so grave as to warrant massive pecuniary penalties on the scale of those recently imposed by Heerey J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Visy Industries Holdings Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 1617.\\n\\n126 Cartel behaviour of the kind with which Heerey J was concerned can, as his Honour noted (at [306]) be extremely damaging to the prosperity of a free market economy. Often the profits to be made can be immense, and the risk of detection slight. That explains, in part, why the legislature has progressively increased the maximum penalties available in relation to this type of conduct.\\n\\n127 Heerey J went on to observe (at [309]) that many countries with free market economies have enacted laws which make cartel conduct by individuals subject to criminal sanctions, including imprisonment. I note that in April 2003 the Dawson Committee recommended the introduction of criminal sanctions for serious cartel behaviour. I also note that on 2 February 2005 the Treasurer announced proposals for the criminalisation of serious cartel conduct. He stated that the maximum penalties for the new cartel offence would be a term of imprisonment of five years and a fine of $220,000 for individuals, and a fine for corporations that would be the greater of $10 million or three times the value of the benefit from the cartel. Where the value could not be determined the fine would be 10% of annual turnover.\\n\\n128 Although not all cartel conduct should be viewed as warranting the imposition of criminal sanctions, including imprisonment, plainly that option should be available in relation to serious cases of such conduct. See generally B Fisse, \\\"The Cartel Offence: Dishonesty?\\\" (2007) 35 Australian Business Law Review 235 at 236. I interpolate that in the event such conduct is criminalised in Australia, problems may arise in formulating a cartel offence in terms that would be comprehensible to ordinary jurors. Section 45 is complex enough. The idea, which has been mooted, of simply adding the notion of \\\"dishonesty\\\" to what is already a daunting provision may be counterproductive. As Fisse notes, no country other than the United Kingdom (the Enterprise Act 2002 (UK)) has made dishonesty an element of a cartel offence, and perhaps for good reason.\\n\\n129 It ought to be possible to define serious cartel conduct in relatively simply terms. Fisse (at 237) makes several useful suggestions as to how this might be done. Whatever else might be said, in appropriate cases imprisonment should be available as a sentencing option. Pecuniary penalties may be seen as simply part of the price of doing business.\",\"7\":\"145 In Lowe v The Queen [1984] HCA 46 ; (1984) 154 CLR 606 Mason J, as his Honour then was, underlined the importance of the parity principle. His Honour said (at 610 611): \\n \\n \\\"Just as consistency in punishment -- a reflection of the notion of equal justice -- is a fundamental element in any rational and fair system of criminal justice, so inconsistency in punishment, because it is regarded as a badge of unfairness and unequal treatment under the law, is calculated to lead to an erosion of public confidence in the integrity of the administration of justice. It is for this reason that the avoidance and elimination of unjustifiable discrepancy in sentencing is a matter of abiding importance to the administration of justice and to the community.\\\"\\n\\n146 In Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26 ; (1997) 189 CLR 295 the principle was further explained. Dawson and Gaudron JJ stated (at 301):\\n \\n \\\"The parity principle upon which the argument in this Court was mainly based is an aspect of equal justice. Equal justice requires that like should be treated alike but that, if there are relevant differences, due allowance should be made for them. In the case of co-offenders, different sentences may reflect different degrees of culpability or their different circumstances. If so, the notion of equal justice is not violated. On some occasions, different sentences may indicate that one or other of them is infected with error. Ordinarily, correction of the error will result in there being a due proportion between the sentences and there will then be equal justice. However, the parity principle, as identified and expounded in Lowe v The Queen , recognises that equal justice requires that, as between co-offenders, there should not be a marked disparity which gives rise to \\\"a justifiable sense of grievance\\\". If there is, the sentence in issue should be reduced, notwithstanding that it is otherwise appropriate and within the permissible range of sentencing options.\\\" \\n \\n (Footnotes omitted.)\",\"8\":\"121 The real question is whether the pecuniary penalties which are now sought, and which have been agreed by the respondents, should be approved.

In that case it was said merely to illustrate that the risk was appreciated.\\n\\n140 I would regard the principle formulated in Universal Music as being inapplicable to this case. Here it is not so much that legal advice was obtained that is relevant. Rather it is the fact that not one of a bevy of lawyers who were involved in structuring and documenting the arrangement considered for a moment that there might be a breach of s 45. It is that which lends support to the respondents' claim, accepted by the ACCC, that they did not act dishonestly and had no idea that they were contravening that section. In no sense did they \\\"appreciate\\\" the risk, and choose to run it.\\n\\n141 I am satisfied that all but two of the pecuniary penalties that are agreed are within the permissible range, and that they should be imposed. These penalties are appropriate because they may deter others from engaging in similar conduct. They are not insubstantial, totalling, for example, in the case of Mr North's clients $765,000.\\n\\n142 The two exceptions are the penalties agreed in relation to Ronda, $65,000, and Mr Bramley, $20,000. Try as I might, and despite the fact that neither of these respondents wished to make any further submissions after discovering what penalties had been agreed between the ACCC and the other respondents, I can see no reason why penalties as severe as these should be imposed upon these two respondents.\"}}"
