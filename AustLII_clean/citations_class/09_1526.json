He first entered Australia on 23 April 1991 when he was 5 years old as a dependent of his father, who was employed with the Bangladesh Embassy in Canberra. On 27 April 2006 he lodged an application for a subclass 457 Business (Long stay) visa, as a dependent of his mother.\\n\\n32 While judges of the High Court have questioned the actual suitability to private and non-curial proceedings, of the test for reasonably apprehended bias that has evolved in curial settings: see Re Refugee Review Tribunal; ex parte H [2001] HCA 28 ; (2001) 179 ALR 425 at [27] - [28] ; it is that \\\"double might\\\" test that is to be applied, albeit with the understanding that the hypothetical fair-minded lay observer in question requires some informed appreciation of the nature of the processes and proceeding of the body whose judgment is being called into question.

It objectifies what otherwise would be a wholly subjective inquiry and it poses the relevant question in a way that avoids having to predict what probably will be done, or to identify what probably was done, by the decision-maker in reaching the decision in question.\\n\\n35 Because of the manner in which the case was originally put, it is appropriate to refer as well to the further observation of Hayne J in Jia Legeng (at [185]) that:\\n \\n \\n Saying that a decision-maker has prejudged or will prejudge an issue, or even saying that there is a real likelihood that a reasonable observer might reach that conclusion, is to make a statement which has several distinct elements at its roots. First, there is the contention that the decision-maker has an opinion on a relevant aspect of the matter in issue in the particular case. Secondly, there is the contention that the decision-maker will apply that opinion to that matter in issue. Thirdly, there is the contention that the decision-maker will do so without giving the matter fresh consideration in the light of whatever may be the facts and arguments relevant to the particular case. Most importantly, there is the assumption that the question which is said to have been prejudged is one which should be considered afresh in relation to the particular case.\\n\\n41 The applicant's case in its initial form and prior to its being brought within the shadow of Eastman , was founded upon the four \\\"elements\\\" propounded by Hayne J in Jia Legeng I have set out above. Put in terms of those elements, it was contended that, first the Senior Member had on 30 May 2009 formed an opinion on a relevant aspect of the matter in issue in the Tribunal; ie that the applicant had committed, or was suspected on reasonable grounds of having committed, a criminal offence on 1 May 2008. This was relevant to the issue of whether the applicant did not pass the character test. It was also relevant in addition by reason of para 1.10 of Direction No 21, as unresolved criminal charges as \\\"general conduct\\\", which the Tribunal was required to take into account under para 2.10 when considering whether it was likely to be repeated. Secondly , despite his protestations to the contrary, it is inconceivable that the Tribunal did not take such credible, relevant and significant material into account when it found that there was an unacceptable risk that the applicant would reoffend: cf Applicant VEAL of 2002 at [17]. Thirdly , it is apparent from the way in which the case was conducted that the Tribunal did not give this issue any fresh consideration in the light of whatever may have been the facts and arguments relevant to the particular case. To the contrary, the Tribunal member resisted receiving any further evidence from the applicant relating to the matter, thereby leaving the state of the evidence at the time of its decision being that presented to it by the AFP on 30 May 2008. Finally , it is contended that the Tribunal was required to consider the unresolved criminal charges as part of its overall consideration of whether his so-called general conduct was likely to be repeated. This much is apparent from Direction 21.\\n\\n51 As with the Eastman case, I regard the circumstances of this matter as distinctive. While they may be able to be pigeon holed within the four \\\"elements\\\" referred to by Hayne J in Jia Legeng as the applicant first contended, that process does not sufficiently accentuate what in my view are the essential concerns which the unusual course of conduct followed in this matter exposes. These are to maintain the integrity of the Tribunal's processes and procedures and to provide public reassurance of that integrity.\",\"3\":\"34 Because, as will be seen, the application of this test in this matter does require an examination, amongst other things of the Tribunal's reasons, it is important to emphasise that the lay observer would be scrutinising those reasons through a quite different prism and by reference to a quite different contingency, than a judge would be when scrutinising a decision-maker's reasons for decision for the purpose of discerning an error justifying judicial review: cf Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 271-272. To say this is not to accord the hypothetical observer licence to indulge in implausible or improbable interpretations of reasons for decision. The lay observer is expected first and foremost to be \\\"fair minded\\\".\",\"4\":\"36 While the evidence in the matter is that the Tribunal member who issued the listening device warrant was named in an AFP statement of facts given to the applicant in August 2008, it has not been suggested that he was aware at the time of the Tribunal hearing that the member hearing the review application was the person who issued the warrant. Neither did the Tribunal member disclose that fact if he was then actually aware of it. In consequence, and counsel for the Minister accepted, there was no issue of waiver of bias in this matter: see Vakauta v Kelly [1989] HCA 44 ; (1989) 167 CLR 568 at 572-573; see also Shingles v Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Authority [2009] FCA 1211.\",\"5\":\"36 While the evidence in the matter is that the Tribunal member who issued the listening device warrant was named in an AFP statement of facts given to the applicant in August 2008, it has not been suggested that he was aware at the time of the Tribunal hearing that the member hearing the review application was the person who issued the warrant.

In each case, at some time prior to the criminal proceedings in question, the judge who respectively became the trial judge authorised the use of a listening device in relation to the person who was ( Eastman ), or subsequently became ( George ), the accused in the proceedings. In George the particular matter before the judge under the Listening Devices Act did not involve anything to do with the subject of the later charges. In Eastman the contrary was the case and, when the matter was drawn to his attention, the trial judge disqualified himself on the ground of reasonable apprehension of bias. As he said (at 153):\\n \\n \\n What distinguishes this application from the application made in R v George is that the warrants were issued by me on the application of one or more police officers so as to facilitate the acquisition of evidence against the accused. In two instances the exercises were successful, because the Crown proposes to lead evidence of having installed listening devices under the authority of two warrants and the evidence thereby obtained. The ground for disqualifying myself is much stronger than that confronted by the trial judge in R v George . \\n \\n\\n \\nIn George in contrast, an appeal challenging a conviction of the ground of apprehended bias was dismissed, the Court having regard to the nature of a criminal trial, the various activities in which judges may be involved in the administration of criminal justice and particularly \\\"to the absence of any association [of the listening device matter] with this particular case.\\n (ii) Procedural Fairness\\n\\n41 The applicant's case in its initial form and prior to its being brought within the shadow of Eastman , was founded upon the four \\\"elements\\\" propounded by Hayne J in Jia Legeng I have set out above.

Finally , it is contended that the Tribunal was required to consider the unresolved criminal charges as part of its overall consideration of whether his so-called general conduct was likely to be repeated. This much is apparent from Direction 21.\\n\\n43 In light of what was said by Gallop J in Eastman , the applicant contends as well that, having made a decision to issue a warrant which required him to form a view of the applicant's recent charge, the Tribunal member ought to have disqualified himself from hearing the subsequent application which required him to form a view of the applicant's conduct and whether he was likely to re-offend.\\n\\n44 For my own part, I again emphasise that the test to be applied does not require analysis of the likely or actual thought processes of the Tribunal. There is no evidence as to whether, if at all prior to his decision the member recalled issuing the warrant involving Mr Islam. Such view as the lay observer might take on that matter, provided it is reasonable, may well be mistaken. That is not to the point.\\n\\n45 The Tribunal did not disclose at the hearing its participation in the issue of the warrant. The member may well have had no memory of that. The member, equally, may have known or have become aware of that participation but have considered he could or should neutralise the significance of it by determining the matter without taking into account \\\"in any way\\\" the 1 May 2008 allegations. Alternatively and despite the significance to be attributed to \\\"general conduct\\\" at the stage of exercising the s 501(1) discretion (which could include \\\"unresolved charges pending a hearing\\\": Direction No 21, the member may have been of the view that account ought not be taken of the 1 May charge in any event as the applicant had not been convicted as charged. I express no view on any of these speculations other than to say that they would be contingencies which a fair minded lay observer could reasonably canvas in forming his or her judgment of the matter.\\n\\n51 As with the Eastman case, I regard the circumstances of this matter as distinctive. While they may be able to be pigeon holed within the four \\\"elements\\\" referred to by Hayne J in Jia Legeng as the applicant first contended, that process does not sufficiently accentuate what in my view are the essential concerns which the unusual course of conduct followed in this matter exposes. These are to maintain the integrity of the Tribunal's processes and procedures and to provide public reassurance of that integrity.\\n\\n52 As Eastman illustrates, the potential is there for apparent compromise of an official's decision making whenever a close relationship or association exists between the subject matter of an administrative or judicial decision to be taken by that official, and adverse information obtained (or an adverse opinion formed) relating to that subject matter in the course of, or as a result of, a separate earlier decision taken by the same official for other purposes. Where it might reasonably be said that the having of (or having had) that information or opinion by virtue of a prior official decision might compromise the proper and impartial taking of the later decision, the same official ought not participate in the later decision. To do so would involve the member in the discharge, in the circumstances, of incompatible functions. Such was the case here.\\n\\n53 It was inappropriate for the Tribunal member, having determined to authorise the issue of the warrant in relation to Mr Islam, to have then made the s 501(1) refusal determination given the association in subject matter of the two determinations or at least to have done so without the informed waiver of objection by Mr Islam to his so doing. Absent such waiver, I am satisfied that the \\\"double might\\\" test of the fair minded lay observer would inevitably be satisfied.\\n\\n54 I have emphasised the complex of competing possible views, that the conduct of the Tribunal member, the course of the hearing and the Tribunal's decision, could reasonably engender in the lay observer. In my view, despite the Tribunal's and, for that matter, the Minister's disclaimers, such an observer could reasonably entertain an apprehension that the Tribunal's decision might have suffered from prejudgment. The closely associated decision-making that occurred here ought not be countenanced. The Tribunal should have procedures to guard against such a possibility.\",\"7\":\"37 The authorities most immediately relevant in a factual setting such as the present on the applicant's contentions are R v Eastman (1994) 121 FLR 150 and R v George (1987) 9 NSWLR 527. In each case, at some time prior to the criminal proceedings in question, the judge who respectively became the trial judge authorised the use of a listening device in relation to the person who was ( Eastman ), or subsequently became ( George ), the accused in the proceedings. In George the particular matter before the judge under the Listening Devices Act did not involve anything to do with the subject of the later charges.

As to the latter ground, as formulated in the application it was that:\\n \\n \\n 4.2.1 The issue of whether the applicant had committed a criminal offence on 1 May 2008 was credible, relevant and significant to the decision on whether or not to affirm the refusal of the visa. As such, the Tribunal was required, as a matter of procedural fairness, to give the applicant an opportunity to respond to information regarding the allegation that he had committed an offence on 1 May 2008. \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n 4.2.3 During the hearing of the application before the Tribunal on 28 November 2008 the Tribunal repeatedly denied the applicant an opportunity to provide a detailed or adequate response to the allegation that he had committed an offence on 1 May 2008.\\n\\n40 During the course of the hearing there was some movement in, and a coming together of, the grounds. This will become apparent in what follows.\\n (a) Apprehended Bias\\n\\n41 The applicant's case in its initial form and prior to its being brought within the shadow of Eastman , was founded upon the four \\\"elements\\\" propounded by Hayne J in Jia Legeng I have set out above. Put in terms of those elements, it was contended that, first the Senior Member had on 30 May 2009 formed an opinion on a relevant aspect of the matter in issue in the Tribunal; ie that the applicant had committed, or was suspected on reasonable grounds of having committed, a criminal offence on 1 May 2008. This was relevant to the issue of whether the applicant did not pass the character test. It was also relevant in addition by reason of para 1.10 of Direction No 21, as unresolved criminal charges as \\\"general conduct\\\", which the Tribunal was required to take into account under para 2.10 when considering whether it was likely to be repeated. Secondly , despite his protestations to the contrary, it is inconceivable that the Tribunal did not take such credible, relevant and significant material into account when it found that there was an unacceptable risk that the applicant would reoffend: cf Applicant VEAL of 2002 at [17]. Thirdly , it is apparent from the way in which the case was conducted that the Tribunal did not give this issue any fresh consideration in the light of whatever may have been the facts and arguments relevant to the particular case. To the contrary, the Tribunal member resisted receiving any further evidence from the applicant relating to the matter, thereby leaving the state of the evidence at the time of its decision being that presented to it by the AFP on 30 May 2008. Finally , it is contended that the Tribunal was required to consider the unresolved criminal charges as part of its overall consideration of whether his so-called general conduct was likely to be repeated. This much is apparent from Direction 21.\\n\\n49 On both of these issues the reasonable and fair minded lay observer could well consider he or she was being asked to, but was unable to, accept that the Tribunal could satisfactorily bifurcate the information it might possess on both those matters, and that it could reach its conclusion on each by reference, for example, to the three bail breaches while not taking into account in any way the view it had of the significance and character of the 1 May 2008 charge derived from the listening device hearing. While the significance of \\\"subconscious effect\\\" is to be treated with circumspection in procedural fairness cases given the relevant inquiry in such cases: cf Applicant VEAL at [19]; the issues of appearance and judgment in apprehended bias cases are, in my view, differently appointed. They do involve an appeal to the good sense and experience of the reasonably informed and fair minded lay (not judicial ) observer.\\n\\n50 If the lay observer might experience some difficulty or reserve in accepting the potential efficacy of a self imposed \\\"Chinese wall\\\" in containing a prior formed opinion, that would well be compounded by the somewhat Delphic character of the Tribunal member's concluding comment on the November 2007 warning from the Minister about \\\"any further conduct bringing him within the provisions of s 501\\\":\\n \\n \\n Unfortunately this warning appears to have not been taken seriously.\\n\\n59 Unlike in Applicant VEAL both the Tribunal and the applicant were aware of the charge and of its being disregarded. As Mr Islam indicated when told it would be so treated \\\"I appreciate it\\\" it was to his advantage. What Mr Islam did not know and was not told, was of the member's participation in the issue of the warrant. The non-disclosure of that participation did not of itself raise a procedural fairness issue. It did set the scene, though, for the applicant's apprehended bias challenge.\\n\\n60 I will order that:\\n 1. The application be allowed.\\n 2. The decision of the Tribunal be set aside.\\n 3. The matter be remitted to the Tribunal to be determined according to law.\\n 4.
