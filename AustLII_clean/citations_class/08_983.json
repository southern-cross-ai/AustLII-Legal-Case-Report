A majority of the Court of Appeal of New South Wales had taken judicial notice of the fact that banking institutions such as Westpac used standard forms of guarantee. The High Court held that to be erroneous. The error was not defended before the High Court and nothing turned on any difference between the common law and s 144.\\n\\n115 The relationship between s 144 and the common law was not agitated in these proceedings. I am content to act upon the basis that the section states the applicable law, authorising this Court to take judicial notice of matters of common general knowledge.\\n\\n116 The Court is invited to take judicial notice of the disadvantage of women practitioners in the legal profession as a matter of \\\"common knowledge ... generally\\\" within the meaning of s 144(1)(a). VWL, in its written submissions, identified the social fact for which it contended. The Commissioner was thereby on notice and not unfairly prejudiced were the Court to act upon the submission. The social fact propounded was the historical and persisting disadvantage of women in relation to their participation and career advancement within the legal profession. At that level of generality there was no dispute. I am prepared to take judicial notice of it. It informs a consideration of whether the VWL was \\\"established for community service purposes\\\" or otherwise met the public benefit requirement of the common law understanding of a charitable institution. It is not, however, critical to the characterisation of the association for the purposes of the ITAA. Characterisation depends primarily upon the objects and, to a degree, upon the activities of VWL in the relevant years of income.\",\"1\":\"125 The concept of charitable purposes was elaborated in a passage, which has literally acquired statutory status, from the judgment of Lord Macnaghten in Commissioners for Special Purposes of Income Tax v Pemsel [1891] AC 531 at 583. That case concerned the Income Tax Act 1842 (UK) 5 and 6 Vict. c 35 which provided for special allowances in relation to income tax on rents and profits of lands vested in trustees for charitable purposes so far as they were applied to charitable purposes. Lord Macnaghten said (at 583):\\n \\\"Charity\\\" in its legal sense comprises four principal divisions: trusts for the relief of poverty; trusts for the advancement of education; trusts for the advancement of religion; and trusts for other purposes beneficial to the community, not falling under any of the preceding heads. The trusts last referred to are not the less charitable in the eye of the law, because incidentally they benefit the rich as well as the poor, as indeed, every charity that deserves the name must do either directly or indirectly. \\nIt is accepted that purposes which are \\\"beneficial to the community\\\" must also be \\\"within the spirit and intendment of the preamble to the Statute of Elizabeth\\\".\\n\\n126 The High Court recently reaffirmed the application of the technical meaning to the word \\\"charity\\\" and its derivatives used in statutes unless a contrary intention is evident. In Central Bayside General Practice Association Ltd v Commissioner of State Revenue [2006] HCA 43 ; (2006) 229 ALR 1 , Gleeson CJ, Heydon and Crennan JJ referred, in a footnote, to the technical legal sense of \\\"charitable\\\" as that defined by Lord Macnaghten in Pemsel [1891] AC 531 \\\"by reference to the spirit and intendment of the preamble to the Statute of Charitable Uses Act 1601 (UK)\\\". Their Honours referred also to \\\"... the general rule that, the word \\\"charitable\\\" being a word that has a technical legal meaning, when it is used in a statute it should be understood in its legal sense unless a contrary intention appears\\\". They noted that the general rule has been accepted as the law of Australia at least since the decision of the Privy Council in Chesterman v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1925] UKPCHCA 2 ; (1925) 37 CLR 317. They further said (at [18] fn 6): \\n The word is commonly used in statutes. It is reasonable to assume that parliamentary counsel, taxpayers, revenue authorities, settlors, testators and others have acted on the faith of an understanding that the general rule applies. \\nThe Full Court of the Federal Court in Commissioner of Taxation v Word Investments Ltd (2007) 164 FCR 194 at [8] accepted, and there was no dispute before it, that the word \\\"charitable\\\" in the relevant provisions of the ITAA 1997 bears its technical legal meaning. It relied upon Bayside [2006] HCA 43 ; 229 ALR 1 for that purpose.\\n\\n133 For an association to be characterised as a charitable institution it must exist for a public benefit as distinct from the creation of private benefits. The fourth class of charitable trust in Pemsel [1891] AC 531 brings in the public benefit requirement through the words \\\"beneficial to the community\\\". As Kenny J said in The Triton Foundation 147 FCR at [22]: \\n The public may, however, include a section of the public. \\nAn association may have a public benefit purpose although some of its subsidiary or ancillary functions may benefit particular persons such as members of a profession: Royal Australian College of Surgeons v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1943] HCA 34 ; (1943) 68 CLR 436 at 447 and other authorities cited in The Triton Foundation 147 FCR at [23].\\n\\n142 The Commissioner contended that VWL was not a charitable institution. He argued that not all purposes which are beneficial to the public are in fact charitable. A trust of the fourth class in Pemsel [1891] AC 531 must be of direct and general benefit to the public. The mere fact that it is for purposes which may tend to be of general public utility would not be sufficient. He cited Taylor v Taylor [1910] HCA 4 ; (1910) 10 CLR 218 at 237 and Barby v Perpetual Trustee Co Ltd [1937] HCA 64 ; (1937) 58 CLR 316 at 324. He did not dispute that a trust for the promotion of the mental or moral improvement of the community could sometimes fall within the fourth class. The requirement of benefit to the public was said to commonly exclude from the status of charitable institutions organisations such as professional bodies established to help those persons who furnish the organisation's funds. These would usually be members or persons eligible for membership but could also be contributors or sponsors. If the main objects of an institution were the protection and advancement of persons practicing in a particular profession, the institution would not be regarded as charitable because the element of direct public benefit was lacking.\",\"2\":\"126 The High Court recently reaffirmed the application of the technical meaning to the word \\\"charity\\\" and its derivatives used in statutes unless a contrary intention is evident.

After referring to relevant authorities, Allsop J observed that the cases did not support the submission. He cited Scottish Burial Reform and Cremation Society Ltd v Glasgow City Corporation [1967] UKHL 3 ; [1968] AC 138 and The Incorporated Council of Law Reporting of the State of Queensland v Commissioner of Taxation [1971] HCA 44 ; (1971) 125 CLR 659 and said (at [18]):\\n ... both stand as authority for the proposition that the making of a profit from the conduct of the charitable activity does not necessarily destroy the charitable nature of the purpose exhibited by the activity. \\nStone J agreed with Allsop J.\",\"4\":\"127 Charitable purposes generally do not include political purposes.

In Public Trustee v Attorney-General (1997) 42 NSWLR 600 at 602, Santow J observed of the High Court decision in Royal North Shore Hospital of Sydney v Attorney-General (NSW) [1938] HCA 39 ; (1938) 60 CLR 396 at 426: \\n The High Court's formulation suggests that a trust may survive in Australia as charitable where the object is to introduce new law consistent with the way the law is tending. \\nIn his paper in the Australian Bar Review, Santow J also observed that a trust which has an undoubtedly charitable object does not lose its charitable status simply because it also has an object of changing the law or reversing policy (at 248): \\n The question is always whether that \\\"political object\\\" precludes the trust satisfying the public benefit requirement.\\n\\n139 In relation to the political purposes question, VWL submitted that it was not formed for the purpose of changing a specific law or laws or government policy. One of its primary activities have been directed to maintaining and educating the community about and enforcing existing laws. The promotion of humanitarian objects and those relating to basic human rights were said to be charitable even though, on occasion, (although not in this case) they might involve or require a change in policy or law. The judgment of Santow J in Public Trustee v Attorney-General (1997) 42 NSWLR 600 was cited and, in particular, his Honour's observation that: \\n There is a range of activity from direct lobbying of the government, to education of the public on particular issues, in the interests of a climate conducive to political change.

Under the trust payments were to be made to the London Society for Women's Service for so long as it should, in the opinion of the trustee, continue to promote the objects of the trust. Whitford J noted that it was not suggested that the society as such was a charity in the eyes of the law although some of the activities would undoubtedly qualify as charitable. The question before him related to the object of the founder of the trust (at 34): \\n So the question is whether the dominant or essential object here revealed is a political one, for it stands accepted in argument before me that if the object be a political object and if this be a purpose trust then it must be invalid. I think that it cannot seriously be contended that the object here is essentially a political object. It seems to me quite clear that the dominant or essential object is the achievement of equality albeit in political and economic fields, that the founder in no sense is concerned with any particular political or economic doctrine or cause; she is concerned merely to ensure that within these fields there should be equality of status between women and men.\",\"15\":\"142 The Commissioner contended that VWL was not a charitable institution.

He argued that not all purposes which are beneficial to the public are in fact charitable. A trust of the fourth class in Pemsel [1891] AC 531 must be of direct and general benefit to the public. The mere fact that it is for purposes which may tend to be of general public utility would not be sufficient. He cited Taylor v Taylor [1910] HCA 4 ; (1910) 10 CLR 218 at 237 and Barby v Perpetual Trustee Co Ltd [1937] HCA 64 ; (1937) 58 CLR 316 at 324.

It was an unincorporated association, the objects of which included the advancement of the interests of women and children and humanity in general. It also brought together representatives of other women's organisations including the promotion of their activities and projects directed to community welfare. The AAT held that the Council's predominant purpose was not that of a social club or discussion group. Its political and lobbying activities had been minimal. It played an active role in community service activities and not a passive one.\\n\\n156 The AAT found that the Council would hold one annual general meeting each year, nine monthly general meetings, ten monthly executive meetings and a number of lunches and seminars. One of the \\\"subtle roles\\\" of the Council was to widen the support network of its affiliated organisations. Delegates and members who attended Council meetings and executive meetings would support the activities of affiliated organisations financially and by doing unpaid work. Council delegates and members assisted by donating and collecting goods for the needy such as baby clothes and by knitting items for the needy during general meetings. Most of the member organisations appeared to qualify as community service organisations.\\n\\n157 The AAT held that the predominant purpose of the Council's meetings involved the coordination of community service work and the provision of exchange of information for the purpose of facilitating such work. It held the Council to be an association established for community service purposes, not being political or lobbying purposes and so exempt from income tax.\",\"19\":\"158 In Navy Health Ltd v Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation (2007) ATC 4568 ,, Jessup J considered the characterisation of a non-profit single member company providing private health insurance through a fund. Membership of the fund was limited to serving members of the Australian Defence Forces and cognate classes of person. The company contended that its objects promoted the efficiency of the Australian Defence Forces which benefited the community as a whole so that it would fall within the description of a \\\"charitable institution\\\" for the purpose of an exemption under the Fringe Benefit Tax Assessment Act 1986 (Cth). Alternatively, it submitted that it was a \\\"non profit association\\\" established for community service purposes and thereby attracting a life exemption.\\n\\n159 The fringe benefit tax exemption provision was based on s 23(g)(v) of the ITAA 1936. Jessup J referred to the Explanatory Memorandum and accepted that it was clear that the words of the exemption were not limited to charitable purposes. He said (at [83]): \\n Although a composite expression, I consider that the essence of \\\"community service\\\" is that a service is provided to the community, or a section of the community. Here the word \\\"service\\\" is used in the sense of \\\"health, benefit or advantage\\\", particularly \\\"the action of serving, helping or benefiting, conduct tending to the welfare or advantage of another\\\" (OED 2nd Ed). \\nHis Honour held the term \\\"community\\\" to refer not only to the community as a whole but also to any identifiable section of the community. It did not follow that the receipt of a service by any group of persons should be regarded as the receipt of that service by a section of the community.\\n\\n160 The question of characterisation of the VWL in this respect is not straight forward. It submitted that it provides for the welfare of the community or a section of it. Its purposes included the carrying out of activities and undertaking of projects for women in the law who have a particular need for those projects and activities by reason of their social and economic circumstance, namely their sex.\\n\\n161 VWL also submitted that it was not involved in the furtherance of political or lobbying purposes. As to the latter it referred to the definition of lobbying in the Oxford English Dictionary: \\n 1. To influence (members of a house of legislature) in the exercise of their legislative functions by frequenting the lobby. 2. To frequent the lobby of a legislative assembly for the purpose of influencing members' votes, to solicit the votes of members. \\nVWL submitted that \\\"lobbying\\\" in its statutory context bore a narrow political meaning tying proscribed political activity to direct interaction with members of parliament for stated ends and purposes. It is not clear to me that the term \\\"lobbying\\\" is to be construed so narrowly given the width of the concept of political purposes. In my opinion it could extend to representations to government or members of parliament for changes in policy as well as changes in the law.\\n\\n162 The Commissioner submitted that the concept of \\\"community service\\\" is similar to that of \\\"public benefit\\\" in the law of charitable trusts. It would not follow that receipt of a service by any group of persons should be regarded as the receipt of that service by a section of the community. In the Commissioner's submission \\\"community service\\\" requires the community or a section of the community to benefit by way of receipt of some identifiable help, benefit or advantage bestowed or provided directly by the putative benefactor. Such a requirement is not satisfied, it was submitted, merely because an association's activities or some of them might have a tendency to benefit the community as a whole or a section of it. In this regard the Commissioner relied upon the observation of Jessup J where he found that the community service requirement was not satisfied merely because the operations of the organisation had a tendency to promote the efficiency of the armed forces thereby benefiting the community as a whole.\\n\\n163 In my opinion the concept of \\\"community service\\\" was intended to pick up a broader range of organisations than those covered by the concept of \\\"charitable institution\\\" and in particular that class of charitable institution falling within the rubric \\\"beneficial to the community\\\". However, an organisation may be beneficial to the community without delivering a \\\"community service\\\" in the sense contemplated by that term as explained in the Explanatory Memorandum. For the reasons I have already expressed, I am of the view that the purposes of VWL are beneficial to the community in the sense necessary to qualify it as a charitable institution. The concept of \\\"community service\\\" does seem to import the notion of the delivery of some practical \\\"help, benefit or advantage\\\" in the sense used by Jessup J. That criterion is not necessarily met by an organisation whose purpose is to change practices and attitudes in such a way as to facilitate the entry and advancement of women within the profession generally.\\n\\n164 The matter is not without difficulty and it is unnecessary to reach a concluded position on it. It is sufficient unto the day that I have found that VWL is a charitable institution, that it attracts the relevant exemption and that its appeals must therefore be allowed.\\n\\n165 Having regard to my conclusions about the status of VWL as a charitable institution, it is unnecessary to make any findings in relation to whether certain elements of its receipts were income in the relevant years. The appeals will be allowed. The orders which were suggested by the Commissioner in that event are the orders which I will make in the following terms: \\n \\n1. The appeal be allowed. \\n \\n2. The respondent's notice of assessment the subject of the appeal be set aside. \\n \\n3. There is no order as to the costs of the appeal. \\n\\n I certify that the preceding one hundred and sixty-five (165) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice French . \\n\\n\\n Associate:\\nDated: 27 June 2008\\n\\n Counsel for the Applicant: Ms A Richards QC and Ms K Streckfuss \\n \\n Solicitor for the Applicant: Freehills \\n \\n Counsel for the Respondent: Mr SW Gibbs SC and Mr S Linden \\n\\n Date of Hearing: 15, 16 and 17 October 2007 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 27 June 2008 \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2008\\/983.html\"}}"
