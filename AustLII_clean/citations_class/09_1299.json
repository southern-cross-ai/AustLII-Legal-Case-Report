Under the old law, the Trade Marks Act 1955 (Cth), where it was a question of whether a trade mark was distinctive, three letter marks were, in the main, treated as not prima facie qualified for registration. This view was in line with Lord Parker's dictum that \\\"initials are even less adapted for trade mark purposes than names\\\": Re W & G du Cros Ltd's Application (1913) 30 RPC 660 at 672. Under the old legislation, it was the registrar's practice, prima facie, to accept three letter marks only if the letters formed a pronounceable word. The test under the new law, however, is not whether the trade mark is distinctive, but whether it is capable of distinguishing. The registrar, to this end, has adopted a new practice based on an assessment of the likelihood of others' needs to use letters, particularly as initials. It is useful for me to quote from the Trade Marks Office Draft Manual of Practice and Procedure at 22.9. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 9. Letters \\n Trade marks consisting of one or two letters are prima facie unfit for registration because of a common need for their use in the general market place. The likelihood of other traders needing to use simple unembellished combinations of one or two letters in the form of initials or abbreviations is quite high. One or two letter trade marks, unless represented in a very unusual manner, possess little inherent adaptation to distinguish and can only be registered with significant evidence of use in terms of s 41(5) and (6). There is likely to be less need for use of combinations of three or more letters and such trade marks are prima facie capable of distinguishing. For information on how the courts have treated letter trade marks, see Registrar of Trade Marks v W & G Du Cros Ltd (W & G case ) 29 RPC 74 and RPC 653.\\n 9.1 One and two letter trade marks \\n One and two letter trade marks without significant get up are not prima facie registrable.\\n ...\\n 9.2 Three or more letter trade marks \\n Trade marks consisting of three or more letters are prima facie capable of distinguishing unless they lack inherent adaptation to distinguish because they are well known acronyms or abbreviations used on or in relation to the goods and\\/or services concerned. The issue of pronunciation is not relevant ... \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n The submission from Mr Condon is that the application trade marks are merely part of the applicant's trade name and he cites Re Application by American Tobacco Co [1996] ATMO 29 ; (1996) 35 IPR 98 as support. That case, however, finds that the words \\\"The American Tobacco Company\\\" are generic and are therefore not capable of distinguishing one American tobacco company from another. The AEI trade marks in suite do not suffer from a generic application of that kind. The American Tobacco Co case is therefore not to the point. The evidence of the opposition certainly establishes that there is indeed one other service provider with the same initials. However, I think that a single example is not enough to find that the registrar's practice in relation to three letter marks is not a good one. AEI has not been shown to have any meaning that renders it not capable of distinguishing and I do not agree with Mr Condon that the fact it coincides with the initials of the company name of its owner indicates that it lacks that capacity. In short, I do not think it is likely that many other insurance suppliers and brokers are likely to want to use the initials AEI. I therefore find that, in terms of s 41, there is no ground for rejection.\",\"1\":\"The applicant referred me to the decision of Allsop J (as he then was) in Anheuser-Busch Inc v Budejovick&yacute; Budvar [2002] FCA 390 ; (2002) 56 IPR 182 at [184] [192] and submitted that the relevant principles were adequately summarised in those paragraphs of his Honour's judgment.

The assessment is made from the perspective of what a person looking at the label would see and take from it, as to the purpose and nature of its use: Shell Co , above at 425; Wrigley's (A'sia) Ltd v Life Savers (A'asia) Ltd (1936) 37 SR (NSW) 9 at 16; Aldi Stores , above, at [22] [24] and [76].\\n\\nI adopt and apply the following statement made by Allsop J in Anheuser-Busch Inc [2002] FCA 390 ; 56 IPR 182 at [191] : \\n \\n It is not to the point, with respect, to say that because another part of the label (the white section with \\\"Budejovicky Budvar\\\") is the obvious and important \\\"brand\\\", that another part of the label cannot act to distinguish the goods. The \\\"branding function\\\", if that expression is merely used as a synonym for the contents of ss 7 and 17 of the TM Act, can be carried out in different places on packaging, with different degrees of strength and subtlety. Of course, the existence on a label of a clear dominant \\\"brand\\\" is of relevance to the assessment of what would be taken to be the effect of the balance of the label.\\n\\nHaving regard to the factors set out in [155] above, I think that the letters \\\"BSS\\\" on the allegedly infringing label are used in a branding role. It does not matter that the respondent may have made it clear on the packaging that the commercial origin of the goods was the respondent, ie a business other than that conducted by the applicant. The letters \\\"BSS\\\" may have been used in this way as an opening shot in a campaign by the respondent designed to demonstrate or generate generic use of the letters \\\"BSS\\\" but, at the time they were used on the relevant label, they were used to distinguish the respondent's goods from those of others, ie to brand them.\\n\\nSubject to the s 122(1)(b)(i) defence relied upon by it, the respondent, therefore, infringed the applicant's BSS trade mark in the manner alleged by the applicant. The Section 122(1)(b)(i) Defence\",\"2\":\"The applicant submitted that all of the journal articles originally published overseas, the overseas dictionaries and the excerpts from the two textbooks originally published overseas should all be rejected as not being relevant to distinctiveness as at 6 December 2006 because none of those publications could conceivably be relevant to the Court's determination of that question. The applicant also submitted that, given that a trade mark is a purely territorial concept which is legally operative and effective only within the territory within which it is used and for which it is registered or for which it is to be registered, it was of no moment that, in various publications originally published overseas, there was demonstrated a use of the letters \\\"BSS\\\" which could arguably support the respondent's contention that the letters had become descriptive of \\\"balanced salt solution\\\". In support of its objection, the applicant relied upon the following passage in the judgment of Gibbs J (as he then was) in Burger King Corporation v Registrar of Trade Marks [1973] HCA 15 ; (1973) 128 CLR 417 at 422 423: \\n \\n On the other hand, the evidence that the word has been extensively used in the United States of America and has there become widely known as indicating the goods of the applicant only, is in my opinion in a different situation. On this point counsel for the Registrar referred me to certain authorities whose effect is summed up in the following passage from the judgment of Tomlin J. (as he then was) in Impex Electrical Ltd. v. Weinbaum [(1927) 44 R.P.C. 405 , at p. 410], which has been accepted, by this Court as well as in the United Kingdom, as a correct statement of the law (see Re Notox Ltd.'s Application [(1930) 48 R.P.C. 168 , at p. 178]; Re Gaines Animal Foods Ltd's Application [(1951) 68 R.P.C. 178 , at p. 179]; de Cordova v.

[(1947) [1947] HCA 59 ; 75 C.L.R. 203 , at pp. 215, 216]): \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\\"For the purpose of seeing whether the mark is distinctive, it is to the market of this country alone that one has to have regard. For that purpose foreign markets are wholly irrelevant, unless it be shown by evidence that in fact goods have been sold in this country with a foreign mark on them, and that the mark so used has thereby become identified with the manufacturer of the goods.\\\" \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Those cases are authority for the proposition that in deciding whether a mark is distinctive, user within the jurisdiction only is to be taken into account. However, in the present case the question is a different one, namely, whether evidence of user overseas is admissible on the issue whether a trade mark is capable of becoming distinctive. \\n \\n\\n Decision on Admissibility\\n\\nI think that these submissions made on behalf of the applicant in support of its objection to all of the overseas material sought to be tendered by the respondent are correct. In my view, it is a long bow for the Court to draw to find that use in the relevant trade in Australia can be established by the availability here of journals, dictionaries and textbooks published overseas which, to some extent, may have been read or looked at by persons participating in that trade. The evidence as to who read this material and when is vague and general. Further, the dictionaries and textbooks can only prove use in the places to which they relate. There was no evidence to suggest that these latter sources related to Australia. For these reasons, I will not admit these overseas materials into evidence for the purpose of establishing that the letters \\\"BSS\\\" did not, as at 6 December 2006, distinguish the applicant's BSS balanced salt solution from sterile ophthalmic irrigating solutions supplied by others within s 234(2) of the Act.\\n\\nDistinctiveness in fact as at 22 March 1988 may be relevant to the respondent's case for cancellation of the applicant's BSS trade mark pursuant to ss 88(1)(a), 88(2)(a), 57 and 41 of the Act. For the same reasons as those advanced for not admitting into evidence the material to which objection was taken for the purpose of establishing lack of distinctiveness as at 6 December 2006, I will not admit that material for the purpose of establishing lack of distinctiveness in fact as at 22 March 1988.\",\"3\":\"Section 24 contemplates that the registered trade mark will be generally accepted as the sign that describes, or is the name of, the relevant article or substance. There must be general acceptance within the relevant trade that the mark is the generic name of the article or substance. Use sometimes by some people will not be enough. Nor will the requirements of the section be satisfied if the mark is only one of two or more generic names for the article or substance.\\n\\nIn the present case, the generic name for the particular article or substance is \\\"balanced salt solution\\\". Balanced salt solution is a particular type of sterile ophthalmic irrigating solution with a particular mix of constituents. Whilst \\\"bss\\\" may well be an acronym for \\\"balanced salt solution\\\", it did not become generally accepted within the relevant period as the generic signification of \\\"balanced salt solution\\\" or of the particular type of sterile irrigating solution comprising the constituents of standard balanced salt solution. The most that can be said, on the evidence, is that the letters \\\"BSS\\\" were sometimes used in the relevant period in scientific journal articles as a convenient editorial abbreviation for \\\"balanced salt solution\\\". Such a use does not demonstrate \\\"general acceptance\\\" in the relevant trade that the mark is the generic name. This is especially so in circumstances where the respondent has chosen to base its case on this point almost entirely on the publications which it tendered, most of which were authored and published overseas.

The test under the new law, however, is not whether the trade mark is distinctive, but whether it is capable of distinguishing. The registrar, to this end, has adopted a new practice based on an assessment of the likelihood of others' needs to use letters, particularly as initials. It is useful for me to quote from the Trade Marks Office Draft Manual of Practice and Procedure at 22.9. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 9.

That case, however, finds that the words \\\"The American Tobacco Company\\\" are generic and are therefore not capable of distinguishing one American tobacco company from another. The AEI trade marks in suite do not suffer from a generic application of that kind. The American Tobacco Co case is therefore not to the point. The evidence of the opposition certainly establishes that there is indeed one other service provider with the same initials. However, I think that a single example is not enough to find that the registrar's practice in relation to three letter marks is not a good one. AEI has not been shown to have any meaning that renders it not capable of distinguishing and I do not agree with Mr Condon that the fact it coincides with the initials of the company name of its owner indicates that it lacks that capacity. In short, I do not think it is likely that many other insurance suppliers and brokers are likely to want to use the initials AEI. I therefore find that, in terms of s 41, there is no ground for rejection.\",\"11\":\"Section 234 has been described as a \\\"gateway\\\" opening the way for a challenge to the continued registration of a trade mark. In TGI Friday's Australia Pty Ltd v TGI Friday's Inc [2000] FCA 720 ; (2000) 100 FCR 358 at [32] [36] (p 364), the Full Court discussed s 234. At [35] [36], the Court said: Section 234(2) does not of itself authorise rectification of the Register by cancellation of a trade mark or otherwise. Rather, the subsection acts as an impediment to any proceeding alleging invalidity. Any application by Friday's Australia and Big Country for rectification of the Register must be made under s 88 of the 1995 Act. Even if, as Friday's Australia and Big Country contend, s 234(2)(d) or (e) applies in this case, the consequence is only that the conclusive presumption of validity does not arise. Satisfaction of one of the conditions in s 234(2) does not, of itself, constitute a ground under s 88(2) of the 1995 Act for rectification of the Register. Therefore, in addition to agitating the question of renewal, Friday's Australia and Big Country seek to establish grounds within s 88(2) that satisfy s 234.\\n\\nThe respondent contended that it discharged its onus of proving that the applicant's BSS trade mark did not, as at 6 December 2006, distinguish the applicant's BSS balanced salt solution from the goods or services of other persons. I shall consider this contention when I come to evaluate the grounds for cancellation of that trade mark relied upon by the respondent.\\n\\nAssuming for the moment that the respondent was able to pass through the s 234 gateway, it then relied upon two grounds in support of its claim that the applicant's BSS trade mark should be removed from the Register. Ground 1 (Trade Mark Not Distinctive as at Application Date)\"}}"
