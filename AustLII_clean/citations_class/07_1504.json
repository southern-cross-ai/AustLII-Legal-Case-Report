The Tribunal was not under an obligation to disregard the symptoms experienced by Ms Butler in her right arm because no person expressed an expert opinion on the relevance of the symptoms in Ms Butler's right arm other than in respect of her carpal tunnel syndrome.\\n\\n37 Ms Butler additionally contended that the Tribunal took into account irrelevant considerations when it had regard to 'inadmissible' evidence of Ms Carrall and Ms Small. While acknowledging that the Tribunal was not bound by the rules of evidence, Ms Butler argued that 'there must be occasions and are occasions that a tribunal could reject evidence that is clearly inadmissible and based on extreme hearsay' .\"}}"
