So much is evident, at least, when it is remembered that one site is a free service and another a subscriber based service thereby lessening possible confusion. As described by the Federal Magistrate the appearance of the two websites is not sufficiently similar to give rise to confusion on the basis of appearance alone or in combination with the names. The fact that some interested people may be confused between the two sites is an insufficient basis to establish a reasonable likelihood of an appreciable or relevant confusion. That is especially so where there is no finding as to whether the number of possible confused people was significant or otherwise. See Hansen Beverage Company v Bickfords (Australia) Pty Ltd [2008] FCAFC 181.\\n\\n23 Having regard to the foregoing it is apparent that JEM's claim under the Act should not have succeeded. The lack of a finding about whether the words insurance, news and Australia - had acquired a distinctive meaning through extensive use is fatal to JEM's ability to maintain the orders it secured below. His Honour did not deal with the claim made by JEM under the tort of \\\"passing off\\\". Rather, his Honour found it unnecessary due to his finding that the respondents succeeded under the TPA. It may be likely that no such claim could be established. In any event, the parties consider, and I agree, that no different result would ensue concerning the passing off claim. \\nThe appeal should be allowed, the operative orders below set aside and the appellants should have their costs of the appeal and of the proceeding below.\\n\\n I certify that the preceding twenty-three (23) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Marshall. \\n\\n\\n Associate:\\n\\nDated: 19 December 2008\\n\\n Solicitor for the Appellants: Mahoneys Solicitors \\n \\n Counsel for the Appellants: Mr G McGowan SC with Mr P Ehrlich \\n \\n Solicitor for the Respondent: Davis Lawyers \\n \\n Counsel for the Respondent: Ms S Gatford \\n\\n Date of Hearing: 17 December 2008 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 19 December 2008 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2008\\/1966.html\"}}"
