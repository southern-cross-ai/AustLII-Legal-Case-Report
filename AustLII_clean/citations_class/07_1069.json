Rather, it is whether the claim was made in good faith.\\n\\n31 The substance of the present Statement of Claim first saw light of day in the District Court proceedings to which I have referred. Even then and in that forum a claim was made that MMA Super \\\"had breached the Trade Practices Act \\\". This hardly suggests an invocation of the TP Act to fabricate jurisdiction. I accept he probably initiated proceedings in this Court because of the casual advice he received.\",\"7\":\"32 As to the Full Court's observation in Kowalski FC referred to above, I do not consider than in the circumstances it provides much by way of support to MMA Super. The Court's observation may well be said to provide an indication of the substantial difficulties that may be confronted by an applicant in trying to bring within the scope of s 52 conduct of the type alleged in a trustee-beneficiary relationship.

While the same is not said of the allegations of failure by MMA Super to perform its duties, it is said nonetheless that the clear inference is there to be drawn that the proceedings as a whole were issued to avoid the effect of the orders of Justice Bleby and of Mr Kowalski's disagreement with the State Supreme Court over waiver of fees and as such are an abuse of process. It has not been suggested, though, that the trust claims have been determined in another forum on their merits. The contrary was conceded in oral argument, although again some comfort was sought to be derived from what was said by the Court about the trust claims in Kowalski FC . Neither has it been suggested that in the plethora of proceedings brought to date any issue estoppel has arisen. Again it is conceded that, unlike in Lindsey v Philip Morris Ltd [2004] FCA 797 where an abuse of process was found, the present is not a matter in which Mr Kowalski has been attempting to re-litigate despite prior actual decisions on the evidence.\\n\\n38 I can deal with this contention shortly. While I am satisfied for reasons I give below that the TP Act claim is unarguable, it has not been suggested that the same is the case with the non-TP Act or \\\"trust claims\\\" as I will for convenience call them. At best it is said that the pleading is vague, not particularly revealing and, in the case of the claim against MMA Super to be provided with his entitlement, has been brought against the wrong respondent.\\n\\n39 If the trust claims had been previously determined on the evidence, there would, in my view, be obvious grounds for the submission that Mr Kowalski was abusing the processes of this Court. Such, though, is not the case. While Mr Kowalski has been declared a vexatious litigant in the State Courts, he has in this Court advanced trust claims which MMA Super has not sought to have dismissed as having no reasonable prospects of success: see Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 , s 31A(2). In these circumstances, unless I am satisfied that the present proceeding is vexatious, I can see no justification for characterising as an abuse of process Mr Kowalski's invocation of the jurisdiction of this Court.\",\"14\":\"44 By way of background to the application of these provisions, it is important to have regard to the fundamental principle on which they entrench.

I will not repeat what I have said above about the proceeding.\\n\\n48 I will not make any orders under O 21.\",\"19\":\"49 I will adjourn further consideration of this matter because, as I will indicate below, I intend to dismiss summarily the TP Act claim, but to leave on foot the non-TP Act claims, though I will require that at least the Statement of Claim be amended. It is appropriate to leave the question of security until after that process has occurred bearing in mind in particular that in the present proceedings almost no attention has been given to the question whether the trust claims have any reasonable prospect of success. That question arises as a factor to be considered on a security application: see Equity Access Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation (1989) ATPR 40-972; and on any possible application made under s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act .\",\"20\":\"50 I had deferred consideration of MMA Super's contention that the TP Act claim disclosed no reasonable cause of action, although I have indicated that it ought be summarily dismissed as having no reasonable prospect of success: see Federal Court of Australia Act , s 31A(2). My reasons for this conclusion have been anticipated inferentially in the observations made in Kowalski FC to which I earlier referred. Assuming for present purposes s 52 of the TP Act (and not Pt 2 Div 2 of the ASIC Act) is potentially applicable to MMA Super in the circumstances, the conduct impugned must, to be actionable, have been engaged in, \\\"in trade or commerce\\\". The allegations made relate to whether MMA Super, as trustee at the relevant time of the superannuation fund, has properly discharged (if at all) its obligations to Mr Kowalski as a member of the trust in accordance with the provisions of the trust. Whatever may have been the consequences of that conduct for the purposes of the law of trusts the trust seems to have been of a type relatively similar to that considered in Toohey's Ltd v Commissioner of Stamp Duties (1960) 60 SR (NSW) 539 at 548 it cannot properly be said that conduct itself was \\\"in trade or commerce\\\".\",\"21\":\"32 As to the Full Court's observation in Kowalski FC referred to above, I do not consider than in the circumstances it provides much by way of support to MMA Super. The Court's observation may well be said to provide an indication of the substantial difficulties that may be confronted by an applicant in trying to bring within the scope of s 52 conduct of the type alleged in a trustee-beneficiary relationship. While there are obvious difficulties in the way of demonstrating in a case such as the present that the conduct of MMA Super was in trade of commerce: cf Concrete Constructions (NSW) Pty Ltd v Nelson [1990] HCA 17 ; (1990) 169 CLR 594 at 602-604; a matter to which I will return below, I am satisfied Mr Kowalski properly and genuinely believed that the TP Act had previously been found to be capable of being applied to a superannuation trustee hence his reliance on State Superannuation Board v Trade Practices Commission [1982] HCA 72 ; (1982) 150 CLR 282, albeit it was a case concerned with Part IV of the Act.\\n\\n51 As is now well settled, the phrase \\\"in trade or commerce\\\" has a restrictive operation. It does not encompass conduct in the course of the myriad of activities which are not, of their nature, of a trading or commercial character but which are undertaken in the course of, or as incidental to, the carrying on of a trading or commercial business.

But what it did in constituting the trust was to facilitate the bringing about of the relationship of trustee and beneficiary between MAA Super and the funds members. That relationship was not intrinsically a commercial relationship nor did the conduct complained of otherwise bear a trading or commercial character: cf Village Building Co Ltd v Canberra International Airport Pty Ltd [2004] FCAFC 240 ; (2004) 210 ALR 114 at [52] . This is not to say that, in the management of the fund, MAA Super may not have engaged in conduct that was in trade or commerce as, for example, in the making and management of the trust's investments. The relevant conduct in question here related simply to MAA Super's performance of the obligations it had to Mr Kowalski under the trust. That conduct, in the context of their relationship, was not an aspect of an activity or transaction that bore a trading or commercial character. It related simply to the provision by MAA Super of such entitlements as Mr Kowalski had under the trust instruments by virtue of his membership of the fund to which he had had access in virtue of his employment with MAAL.\",\"24\":\"53 I will order that that part of the proceeding that relates to a claim for relief under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) be dismissed. I should emphasise that my so doing does not alter the federal character of what remains, my jurisdiction to determine the whole controversy arising when the claims were originally made: see Unilan Holdings Pty Ltd v Kerin (1993) 44 FCR 481 at 481-2; Allsop, at 41 ff.\\n\\n54 Finally, let me refer to the trust claims. I have already indicated some of the criticisms that have been made of these and of the relief sought. I will give Mr Kowalski the opportunity to address these also to more clearly and accurately indicate what his claims are and what, in summary, are the material facts on which he relies. The mantra-like repetition of alleged wrongdoing hardly illuminates what it is alleged was actually done or omitted to be done that gave rise to his causes of action. My giving this leave should not be interpreted as suggesting that the trust claims have reasonable prospects of success. That matter has not been agitated before me. I can only say, as Mansfield J suggested in Kowalski TJ , there are obvious obstacles confronting their prosecution.\\n\\n55 I will order that:\\n \\n \\n (1) the proceeding be dismissed insofar as it claims relief under the provisions of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth); \\n (2) the orders sought in paras 1, 2 and 4 of the notice of motion be dismissed and that the notice of motion otherwise be adjourned to a date to be fixed; \\n (3) the applicant have leave to file and serve an amended application and Statement of Claim on or before Friday, 17 August 2007; and\\n (4) the matter be adjourned for further directions to Monday, 27 August 2007 at 9.00 am. \\n \\n\\n\\n I certify that the preceding fifty-five (55) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Finn. \\n\\n\\n Associate:\\n\\nDated: 24 July 2007\\n\\n The Applicant appeared in person. \\n \\n Counsel for the Respondent: Mr J White \\n \\n Solicitor for the Respondent: Thomson Playford \\n \\n Date of Hearing: 15 March 2007 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 24 July 2007 \\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2007\\/1069.html\"}}"
