There was also a considerable body of evidence led by the Commission that there were numerous instances of inter-company transactions and loans involving substantial sums of money which were not documented. As I observed in my earlier reasons for judgment on 13 February 2009 when I put in place a number of restraining orders, all the corporate defendants in this proceeding, at relevant times, were controlled, or had involved in their activities, one or both of the first defendant, Mr Clestus Weerappah, and the second defendant, Ms Andrea Hawkins: Australian Securities and Investments Commissions v Weerappah [2009] FCA 164. I set out in those reasons for judgment a summary of relevant parts of evidence which was given by Ms Hawkins and Mr Weerappah.\\n\\nIn par [31] of those reasons for judgment I said: \\n \\\"...I am particularly concerned about Ms Hawkins' seeming inability to identify the particular borrowers and lenders involved in a number of transactions which were the subject of evidence by her, and her inability to distinguish which company in the group of companies with which she was involved is entitled to receive, or obliged to pay moneys, or discharge liabilities of other companies in the group. \\n\\n \\nSubsequent to the delivery of those reasons for judgment, Ms Hawkins swore two affidavits in which she explained a number of the financial transactions which are under investigation by the Commission. However, those affidavits, particularly in the light of other evidence relied upon by the Commission, still leave significant doubt and concern in my mind as to the credibility of Ms Hawkins' explanation for a number of those financial transactions, particularly those transactions which have not been documented properly or at all.\\n\\nThe background to the commencement of this proceeding by the Commission is set out in my earlier reasons for judgment and I do not repeat that background. It should be read in conjunction with these reasons for judgment.\"}}"
