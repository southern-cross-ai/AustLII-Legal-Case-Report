The applicants contended that where a party asserts that the whole of an article is claimed to be defamatory of a plaintiff, the plaintiff need not give any further particulars of the words relied on for any imputation pleaded. The applicants relied upon a decision of Menhennett J in A v Ipec Australia Ltd & Crew [1973] VR 39. In my opinion, that was a special case and does not indicate the usual rule as to pleading an imputation arising out of an article where the whole of the article is clearly not defamatory of the plaintiff.\",\"1\":\"48 As I have said, paragraph 46 identifies the imputations which are said to arise in both the natural and ordinary meaning of the words, and by way of a true innuendo. It is necessary to give particulars of the facts and circumstances which are said to support a claim of libel which relies upon the true innuendo. The applicants have given particulars of those facts and circumstances, and there is no complaint about those particulars. There was no obligation at common law to plead particular imputations where the cause of action relies upon the natural and ordinary meaning of the words. However, in New South Wales there was an obligation to plead such imputations under the Defamation Act (1974) (NSW): s 9(2). More recently, it has become the practice in this State and other States in Australia to plead the imputations which are said to arise out of publication, even if those imputations are said to arise in the natural and ordinary meaning of the words: Chapman v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (2000) 77 SASR 181.\\n\\n49 In response to the respondent's request, the applicants provided a schedule which identified the particular documents in each of the paragraphs either for the plea that the imputation arises in the natural and ordinary meaning of the words or for the plea that the imputation arises by way of innuendo.\",\"2\":\"51 The usual rule is that the respondent is entitled to particulars which require the applicants to identify the part or parts of the article which are alleged to be defamatory and which support the imputation pleaded: DDSA Pharmaceuticals Ltd v Times Newspapers Ltd [1973] 1 QB 21 at 26. In that case Lord Denning MR said:\\n In the second place, the pleading is defective because it throws--and I use that word deliberately--on to the defendants a long article without picking out the parts said to be defamatory. Some of the article is not defamatory of anyone at all. It describes only the method of importing drugs. Other parts of the article are defamatory of some unnamed chemists, but not of the plaintiffs at all. Yet other parts may be defamatory of the plaintiffs. To throw an article of that kind at the defendants and indeed at the court, without picking out the particular passages, is high embarrassing. Master Bickford Smith put it very sensibly: \\n \\n \\\"It is tremendously embarrassing to claim the whole of the article as a libel. There is a tremendous amount of the article which is not defamatory of your clients. You must pick out the particular bits and rely on the rest as extrinsic or surrounding facts giving a defamatory meaning to the words.\\\"\\n \\n \\nThat ruling is in accord with the practice as it has been known for many years. The plaintiffs must specify the particular parts defamatory of them. For instance, in this particular case there is a reference to a \\\"London-based operation.\\\" If the plaintiffs say that it means the plaintiffs, they should say so. They should insert \\\"(meaning thereby the plaintiffs).\\\" There is a reference to \\\"the largest single network operating from a London suburb.\\\" Do they say that means the plaintiffs? If they do, they should put in \\\"(meaning thereby the plaintiffs).\\\" Such an exercise will be a great advantage to the plaintiffs themselves. It will make them clear their minds: and it will help the defendants too.\",\"3\":\"74 However, the applicants should be required to give particulars of the constructive knowledge which it is claimed the respondent had: Fox v H Wood (Harrow) Ltd [1963] 2 QB 601.\\n\\n75 The claim that a party ought to have known something must depend upon objective facts and circumstances from which it may be concluded that the party should have acquired the knowledge alleged. The allegation that a party ought to have known something carries with it the claim that, notwithstanding the proven facts and circumstances, the party did not acquire that knowledge. A claim such as is made in this pleading that the respondent knew or ought to have known that the imputations were false means that the respondent either knew that the imputations were false or, by reason of the surrounding facts and circumstances, should have known that the imputations were false.\\n\\n76 There will be an order therefore that the applicants give particulars of the facts and circumstances which allow it to be said that the respondent ought to have known that the imputations referred to in paragraph 46 of the statement of claim were untrue.\\n \\n \\n 1.13 paragraph 43.1.3 (paragraph 49.1.3): the Applicants identify the actual words, and\\/or sentences of the defamatory statements, on which they base their stated allegation.\",\"4\":\"54 Indeed, so much was recognised by Menhennett J in a later decision in Kerney v Optimus Holdings Pty Ltd [1976] VR 399 at 401.\\n\\n55 For the reasons which follow, in my opinion, the respondent is entitled to further particulars in respect to the plea in paragraph 46.1 but not of the plea in paragraph 46.2.\\n\\n56 Six imputations are said to arise out of the publications in paragraphs 20 and 22. One of these imputations consists of four parts. It is not clear whether the pleader means that that imputation consists of all four parts or those parts are alternatives. But that is not an issue at present. The point is that six separate imputations are said to arise out of the 17 separate publications in paragraph 18 (which are incorporated into paragraph 20) and the three separate publications in paragraph 22. The 17 separate publications in paragraph 20 total 52 pages. The three separate publications in paragraph 22 consist of three pages. The Court and the respondent, at present, have to trawl through 55 pages of material to identify the six discrete imputations pleaded in paragraph 46.1.\",\"5\":\"27 As to the first part of the request for particulars seeking further particularity of the contracts, this request should be refused for three reasons. First, because paragraph 33 identifies the contracts with sufficient particularity, being those contracts which the respondent referred to in his email to the solicitors for the applicants on 15 February 2006. The respondent must know to which contracts he was referring when he sent that email. This is one of those circumstances that the party's own knowledge means that the request for particulars should be refused: Lawson v Perpetual Trustee Co Ltd (1959) 76 WN (NSW) 367. Secondly, the contracts are in fact identified in paragraph 7 of the statement of claim. Thirdly, the contracts which are referred to in the email of 15 February 2006 apparently have not been discovered by the respondent. In that case, the respondent cannot seek further particularity of documents to which he referred in his email and which he has neglected to discover in this proceeding. His failure to discover the documents makes it impossible for the applicants to better identify them.\\n\\n28 As to the request for particularity of the respondent's knowledge, that request must also be refused. Order 12 rule 3 provides:\\n \\n \\n 3(1) A party pleading any condition of mind shall give particulars of the facts on which he relies.\\n \\n (2) In subrule (1) \\\"condition of mind\\\" includes any disorder or disability of mind, any malice and any fraudulent intention, but does not include knowledge.\\n\\n29 The plea in paragraph 33 is confined to actual knowledge. There is no obligation on the applicants to give particulars of the actual knowledge of the respondent. That is because the respondent either did or did not have the knowledge. If as alleged he had that knowledge then, that must be proved by admissible evidence. Particulars are not required.\\n \\n \\n 1.7 paragraphs 30, 30.1 and 30.2 (paragraph 36): the Applicants identify the actual written words and\\/or sentences on which they rely in respect of their stated allegation of solicitation, by the Respondent, of the Applicants customers and suppliers for documents embodying trading terms to which such customers and suppliers have contractually agreed to the prohibition of publication of said documents.\",\"6\":\"22 A pleading must be as brief as the nature of the case allows and contain only a statement of the material facts on which the party relies: O 11 r 3 and O 11 r 2 of the Federal Court Rules (the Rules). It should not contain the evidence by which those material facts are to be proved: O 11 r 2. A party, however, must include in the pleading or in some other document the particulars of the party's claim or defence: O 12 r 1. The object of requiring a party to give particulars is to limit the generality of the pleadings so as to inform the party's opponent of the nature of the case which he or she has to meet and to prevent the opponent from being taken by surprise at the trial: Spedding v Fitzpatrick (1887) 38 Ch D 410. The provision of appropriate particulars should mean that unnecessary expense to the parties will be avoided. Particulars, like material facts, should not include the evidence which the party intends to prove his or her case. Nor should particulars be used as statements of material fact because particulars are not pleaded to by the opposing party: Pinson v Lloyds and National Provincial Foreign Bank Limited [1941] 2 KB 72.\",\"7\":\"53 In Scott v Fourth Estate Newspapers Ltd [1986] 1 NZLR 336, Williamson J said at 339-340:\\n After considering the authorities referred to, my view is that it must be a rare case where a plaintiff can plead a whole article without particularising the passages in the article that he complains of. It may be appropriate to plead the whole article in order to claim that certain passages or libellous statements take their meaning from the article as a whole, but in order to focus the dispute it is important that the allegedly defamatory passages be sufficiently identified.\",\"8\":\"22 A pleading must be as brief as the nature of the case allows and contain only a statement of the material facts on which the party relies: O 11 r 3 and O 11 r 2 of the Federal Court Rules (the Rules).
