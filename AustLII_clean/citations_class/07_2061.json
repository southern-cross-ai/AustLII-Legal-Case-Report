There are many other authorities to the same effect.\\n\\n117 Resale price maintenance was first made illegal in Australia in 1906, although the legislation did not refer to it in express terms: ACCC v High Adventure at [8].\\n\\n118 The policy which underlies s 48 of the Act is that competition is an important feature of the distribution of goods. Resale price maintenance, as a form of vertical price fixing, eliminates the competition which Part IV of the Act seeks to achieve: ACCC v High Adventure at [7].\\n\\n119 As the Full Court observed in ACCC v High Adventure , a number of reasons have been put forward to explain the undesirability of the practice. One of them is that resale price maintenance is often a manifestation of price fixing among retailers. Another is that it inevitably eliminates dealer competition, thereby restricting freedom of competition in the price of goods in the marketplace: ACCC v High Adventure at [7].\\n\\n132 I am not bound to accept statements merely because they have been agreed between the parties: Visy at [1]. I accept that Navman sought to avoid complaints from some of its larger retailers. The threats contained in the emails of Mr Baird and Mr King to non-compliant distributors suggest that this was so. But this also suggests that Navman's resale price maintenance conduct was a manifestation of price fixing among retailers: ACCC v High Adventure at [7].\",\"2\":\"126 It seems to me that these difficulties inform the approach which Spender J took in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Jurlique International Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 79. The effect of what his Honour said at [109] [111] is that the Court should only depart from the penalties agreed by properly informed and legally assisted parties where it is clear that it should do so.\\n\\n127 Navman's contraventions of s 48 were serious. Its conduct was deliberate and was carried out over a lengthy period of time in relation to a range of expensive products. Navman's conduct extended over a period of more than three years in the distribution of marine products, and more than a year in the distribution of PCN products.\",\"3\":\"116 Determination of the amount of a penalty is not an exact science. Each case turns on its own facts and limited assistance is to be obtained from considering the amounts imposed in other proceedings: NW Frozen Foods at 295; Mobil Oil at [51]; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Visy Industries Holdings Pty Limited (No 3) [2007] FCA 1617 at [320] .\\n\\n124 Either approach raises broad questions of judgment because s 76 imports concepts of moral responsibility derived from the criminal law: Visy at [304].\\n\\n128 I am entitled to draw inferences and reach conclusions from the facts that have been agreed in the Joint Submissions: Visy at [1].\\n\\n129 The details of the contraventions show that Navman's conduct was not merely deliberate. It was pursued in an aggressive and high-handed way by the company's most senior managers.\\n\\n130 Navman's corporate culture was not conducive to compliance with the Act . Mr Baird and Mr King did not receive any trade practices training from Navman. I would have thought that senior managers of a multi-national company would have, at very least, a basic understanding of the law even without the need for detailed training. In any event, the failure of the company to provide training and see that its senior managers arranged training for their subordinates reflects badly on Navman's corporate culture.\\n\\n132 I am not bound to accept statements merely because they have been agreed between the parties: Visy at [1]. I accept that Navman sought to avoid complaints from some of its larger retailers. The threats contained in the emails of Mr Baird and Mr King to non-compliant distributors suggest that this was so.

It is for me to determine the appropriate penalties having regard to all the circumstances: NW Frozen Foods Pty Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (1996) 71 FCR 285 at 290-291 (per Burchett and Kiefel JJ); Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd (2004) ATPR 41-993 (per Branson, Sackville and Gyles JJ).\\n\\n116 Determination of the amount of a penalty is not an exact science.

The Full Court in Mobil Oil set out at [51] the six propositions which emerge from the reasons in NW Frozen Foods.\\n\\n121 In Mobil Oil , Branson, Sackville and Gyles JJ agreed at [79] with the principles stated in NW Frozen Foods .\\n\\n122 It is unnecessary for me to repeat the six propositions enumerated in Mobil Oil . I referred at [3] [5] above to the principal factors to which I must have regard. I would add to this that the view of the regulator, as a specialist body, is a relevant consideration, but it is not determinative of the ultimate question of the appropriateness of the penalty: Mobil Oil at [51(iv)].\\n\\n123 It is open to the Court to commence its reasoning by referring to the proposed figure and then limiting itself to considering whether that penalty is within the permissible range. Alternatively, the Court may adopt the reverse process of addressing the appropriate range independently of the agreed figure and then determine whether the proposed penalty falls within the range: Mobil Oil at [54].\",\"5\":\"4 Nevertheless, the parties accept, as they must, that the Court is not merely a \\\"rubber stamp\\\" for the agreement reached between them.

Rather, it is whether those amounts are \\\"within the permissible range\\\" in all the circumstances: NW Frozen Foods at 291.\\n\\n6 In answering that question, it is necessary to consider the following: \\n \\n \\n (i) the parties\\n (ii) the contraventions\\n (iii) the principles which apply as to determination of the appropriate penalty\\n (iv) the principles which apply to cases where the parties agree on the penalty\\n (v) the particular considerations which apply in the present case as a consequence of the principles stated in those authorities.\\n\\n7 In the period covered by the contraventions, ie. between 2001 and 2004, Navman supplied marine navigational equipment and personal and in-car navigational products (\\\"PCN products\\\") through selected retail dealers in Australia.\\n\\n8 Mr Baird and Mr King were senior executives of Navman during the relevant period. Mr Baird was the General Manager of Navman's marine division. He was also a director of the company from November 2003.\\n\\n9 Mr King held the position of National Sales Manager from about August 2003. Later, he became the Australasian Sales Manager for Navman's PCN division. He was the most senior manager in that division and was responsible for its operations in Australia.\\n\\n112 The matters to which the Court may have regard under s 76(1) are not confined to the four matters enumerated in the sub-section.
