While accepting he may be able to point to inconsistencies in evidence relating to events long prior to the preparation of the declarations of witnesses for the Council, or to the non-production of documents created over a decade earlier, he has provided no plausible justification at all for the regularly made and, at first flush, seemingly preposterous consequential allegations of impropriety. I note in passing the standard of proof s 140 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) provides for such allegations: see Qantas Airways Ltd v Gama [2008] FCAFC 69 at [123] - [139] .\\n\\n42 Importantly there is nothing at all to suggest that the very specific matters which were central to his case and in particular the discrepancies in the evidence on the Council's use of its mark as between April and June 1997 were themselves material, or of any causative significance, in the Council obtaining registration of that mark. The supposedly tainted evidence had no bearing on the Delegate's decision.\\n\\n43 I refer to these matters because what would be involved in allowing Mr Wilkshire to amend his application would be the articulation of an, as yet, indiscernible claim (possibly under s 62A) and a claim, moreover, which there is no reason to believe on the material before me will have any substance, legal or factual.\",\"7\":\"48 It is the case generally that the dismissal of a proceeding in this Court by consent can found res judicata and issue estoppels and attract the Anshun doctrine: see generally Maiden, \\\"Recent steps in the evolution of res judicata , cause of action estoppel and the Anshun doctrine in Australia\\\" (2004) 25 Australian Bar Review 130 esp at 138.

It is founded on the consent undertakings noted with the consent orders. It is appropriate to reiterate their terms at this point:\\n \\n \\n 4 The applicant undertakes to the Respondent as follows: \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n (a) not to interfere in any way with the Respondent's application to register trade mark number 942740 (the \\\"Respondent's mark\\\"); and \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n (b) not to threaten the Respondent, any of the Respondent's licenses (whether current or future) or any other person with any form of action (including action for trade mark infringement under the Trade Marks Act 1995 , passing off, breach of section 52 or 53 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 or related State and Territory Fair Trading Legislation and\\/or a breach of copyright) in relation to the use of the Respondent's mark. This undertaking applies to existing and future use of the Respondent's mark in relation to all goods and services. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this undertaking restricts the Applicant's right to use trade mark no. 847,229 in relation to the services for which he is registered.\",\"14\":\"52 As I will indicate below, the undertakings are contractual in character and, no less so than the Court orders, they are binding on the parties. In construing the consent orders and the undertakings, like principles are applied and in particular, evidence of the surrounding circumstances, or context, is admissible: see Nokia Corporation v Liu [2008] FCAFC 138 at [29] - [31] .\\n\\n53 I earlier noted that Mr Wilkshire's legal advisers accepted an offer of compromise made by the Council's solicitors on 9 March 2007. While there may be an outstanding question whether that compromise included a non-disclosure undertaking, there is no doubt that it included the above two undertakings. Whether or not Mr Wilkshire's advisers exceeded their authority in acting as they did is not presently relevant. There can be no doubt that, in the circumstances, they acted within their ostensible authority to compromise the action. Equally there is no doubt that Mr Wilkshire was prepared to accept the compromise in the form offered in the letter of 27 February 2007 from the Council's lawyers. It was, in substance, what is contained in the consent orders and undertakings. Both the evidence and legal principle point in one direction. Whatever grounds for complaint (if any) Mr Wilkshire has against his advisers, he was bound by the consent orders and he remains bound by his contractual undertaking.\\n\\n54 The remaining question is whether, by the undertakings given, he contractually bound himself not to initiate the present proceedings.\",\"15\":\"58 The Council contends that cl 4(b) created an estoppel by convention which barred Mr Wilkshire for instituting the present proceeding. I have some difficulty in understanding how this species of estoppel (on which see generally Handley, Estoppel by Conduct and Election , Ch 8 (2006)) in this setting assists the Council beyond the assistance which it properly can derive from the construction of the undertakings themselves in their setting. The context does provide quite clear indications as to how the language of the undertakings should be interpreted but that conclusion is arrived at by well accepted processes of interpretation. It does not in this matter seem to suggest that the parties adopted some assumption as the \\\"conventional basis\\\" upon which they entered into their compromise and from which Mr Wilkshire should not now be allowed to depart: Grundt v Great Boulder Pty Gold Mines Ltd [1937] HCA 58 ; (1937) 59 CLR 641 at 657.\",\"16\":\"59 As Allsop P indicated in Masterton Homes Pty Ltd v Palm Assets Pty Ltd [2009] NSWCA 234 at [3] :\\n \\n \\n ... the identification of ambiguity is not a precondition for examining contextual and background material otherwise legitimate to examine in furtherance of the construction and interpretation of a written contract.\\n\\n60 It is in my view quite clear that considered together with the consent orders (which, unfavourably to Mr Wilkshire, brought to an end the proceeding that was then on foot), the manifest intent of the two undertakings was to (a) secure that Mr Wilkshire would not interfere with the Council's obtaining registration of its mark (cl 4(a)); and (b) thereafter he would not interfere with the Council's use and enjoyment of its registered mark, directly or indirectly (cl 4 (b)). Likewise the manifest intent of the consent orders, when considered in the context of the undertakings, was not simply to bring to an end a proceeding of \\\"a quasi summary nature\\\". Put shortly, the combined effect of the orders and undertaking was that their dispute over the mark was to be at an end then and thereafter. Order 1 and Undertaking 4(a) were to secure for the Council its registered mark vis-&agrave;-vis Mr Wilkshire; Undertaking 4(b) was to secure the use and enjoyment of that registered mark undisturbed by actions, threatened or initiated, by Mr Wilkshire. In aggregate the parties' compromise agreement was more than the bare compromise on an opposition appeal. In this setting \\\"not to threaten ... with any form of action\\\" manifestly was intended to comprehend \\\"the initiation\\\" of an action. Similarly any action in relation \\\"to the use of\\\" the registered mark encompassed an action in relation to its use as a registered mark.\\n\\n61 In its setting cl 4(b) is not in my view to be construed as some adaptation of the s 129 \\\"threat action\\\". Rather, it can, and should be, interpreted as I have indicated above. As such, it could be relied upon as a complete defence to the prosecution of the present application. It provides yet another basis for summary judgment against him under s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act .\"}}"
