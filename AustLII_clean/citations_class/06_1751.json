As Ms Barry advanced no submissions to the Court, and it is not clear beyond argument that the Court's jurisdiction under s 44(1) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act was properly invoked (see Comcare v Etheridge [2006] FCAFC 27 ; (2006) 227 ALR 75), I prefer to make orders under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act .\\n\\n30 The orders of the Court will therefore be:\\n \\n 1.
