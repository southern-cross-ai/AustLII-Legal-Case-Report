The claims made against the first and third respondents are doomed to failure as they disclose no reasonable causes of action in any event. The Amended Statement of Claim is itself embarrassing and must be struck out under O 11 r 16. As the applicant has been given every reasonable opportunity to replead and has been given adequate forewarning of what was needed and required, I will not give leave again to further amend the Amended Statement of Claim. Rather I will order the application be dismissed.\\n\\nI will consider the claims made against each respondent in turn.\",\"1\":\"There are two bases on which relief was sought against the Minister. The first was that he was vicariously liable for the misfeasance tort of the second and third respondents. Accepting that an employer could be vicariously liable for such a tort: see Racz v Home Office [1994] 2 AC 45; Porter v OAMPS Ltd (2005) 215 ALR 327 at [108]; the applicant abandoned this claim when confronted with the constitutional reality in this country that public servants, such as the second and third respondents who are employed under the Public Service Act 1999 (Cth), are employees of the Commonwealth, not of the relevant portfolio Minister.\",\"2\":\"There are two bases on which relief was sought against the Minister.
