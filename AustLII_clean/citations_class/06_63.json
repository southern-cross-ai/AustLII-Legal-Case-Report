The learned Magistrate made an order under s 120(3) for payment of costs of $115,000 'inclusive of the GST component, investigation costs, and prosecution disbursements and costs'. An appeal against the convictions, and against the order under s 120(3) was dismissed: Moore-McQuillan v WorkCover Corporation [2005] SASC 13.\\n\\n5 At the completion of his sentencing remarks, the learned Magistrate said:\\n \\n 'I order that the payment [of the $115,000] be made as follows: \\n The defendant is to pay the Registrar for and on behalf of the complainant the legal costs of prosecution mentioned. He is to fix the time and method of payment with the Court's unit set up for that purpose. The default of payment is pursuant to the provisions of the Criminal Law Sentencing Act [sic]. '\\n\\n6 The trustee initially took the view that the award of costs of $115,000 'has the character of a penalty or fine imposed by the Court', so that s 82(3) of the Act applies and the liability is not a debt provable in the applicant's bankruptcy. Subsequently, he said the position was unclear. He has indicated there are no funds in the bankrupt estate of the applicant to enable any dividend to be paid. He does not therefore intend to call for proofs of debt. He has nevertheless attended to provide relevant materials to the Court and to assist the Court by submissions.\",\"1\":\"12 There is no definition of the expression 'penalties' in s 82(3). However, it has received judicial consideration. In Re Higgins; Ex parte Higgins and Nicholson (1984) 4 FCR 533 ( Higgins ), Spender J held that an award of costs in proceedings for a penalty or fine for an offence against a law was a component part of the total sum which bears a punitive character, and should be characterised as a penalty for the purposes of s 82(3) of the Act. Consequently, neither the fines imposed, nor the costs ordered to be paid, were provable in the bankruptcy. That decision was followed and applied by Farrell JR in Marshall v Western Australia (1998) 84 FCR 363.\\n\\n13 However, I think it is necessary to look a little more closely at the decision in Higgins before simply applying it to the present application. The starting point is to note the overall purpose of the Act.\\n\\n22 In my view, Higgins is not a decision directly on point. It too was an application under s 60(1) of the Act. Spender J made the determination that s 60(1) was not available in the particular circumstances, because the fine and costs imposed were in reality the punishment. The bankrupt was ordered to pay the fine and costs within a specified period, with a term of imprisonment in default of payment. His Honour at 537 described them as \\n \\n ' ... but components of a total sum which has a punitive character in that non-payment of which is visited by imprisonment'. \\n \\n\\nMoreover, the costs order was made under the general discretionary power of the Magistrates Court under s 157 of the Justices Act 1886 (Qld) to order costs, and the costs were payable to the prosecuting authority (the Builders' Registration Board of Queensland) rather than to the victims of the contravening conduct. In addition, Spender J at 539 contrasted the situation with which he was faced with orders amounting to pecuniary penalties payable in consequence of the non-payment of a provable debt: see Storey v Lane (above) at 563.\",\"2\":\"12 There is no definition of the expression 'penalties' in s 82(3).
