The assessments resulted from an audit of the affairs of the appellant. The issues on the appeal concern the ascertainment of gross sales and the deduction of purchases in connection with a retail business carried on by the appellant.\\n\\n2 Under s 44(1) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) an appeal lies to the Federal Court only on a question of law.\\n\\n3 In October 1995 the appellant commenced a duty free retail business in Springvale, Victoria. In January 2002 the Australian Tax Office conducted an audit of the appellant's affairs. An assessment was issued for 1997 and an amended assessment for 1998. After extensive discussions with the appellant's then accountant, objections were allowed in part.\",\"1\":\"12 I am not persuaded that any of these questions are truly questions of law for the purpose of s 44(1) of the Act. While counsel for the Commissioner accepts that a question whether a finding was based on no evidence would be a question of law, the present case has to be considered in light of the onus of proof imposed on the taxpayer by s 14ZZK(b)(i) of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth). The appellant has to prove not only a case of error, but what the correct assessment was: Trautwein v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1936] HCA 77 ; (1936) 56 CLR 63 at 88, Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Dalco [1990] HCA 3 ; (1990) 168 CLR 614 at 623. Questions as to what were the true amount of the appellant's gross income and purchases in the 1997 year were questions of fact. For the reasons explained by the Tribunal, the appellant did not establish any different figures from those assessed by the Commissioner on the basis of the appellant's own financial records, such as they were.\",\"2\":\"12 I am not persuaded that any of these questions are truly questions of law for the purpose of s 44(1) of the Act.
