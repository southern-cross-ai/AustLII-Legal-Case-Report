That is, they have not sought positively to assert that the counterfeit goods were not counterfeit because the marks in question were applied with the consent of the registered owner. Had they done so, then it would have been incumbent on them to make out their case: see Brother Industries, Ltd v Dynamic Supplies Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1490 at [72] per Tamberlin J. As things stand, even if they had relied on s 123 , in the absence of evidence tending to support this assertion, there would be no reason to believe that they had any reasonable prospect of succeeding on a s 123 defence.\\n\\n39 In these circumstances, there is nothing to be gained from adjourning this motion to permit the respondents to have a subpoena issued to Mr Duong. The respondents have not presented any evidence that would indicate that he could give relevant evidence concerning the issue of authorisation. They have not proposed in argument how he could give any such evidence. On the face of it, it seems most unlikely that he could assist the respondents at all on this question, especially when the evidence of Mr Shepherd is borne in mind.\",\"13\":\"40 In written submissions filed with leave after the hearing, counsel for the respondents submitted that s 123 was not 'a defence' in the strict sense. Instead, s 123 reduced the ambit of s 120. It was unnecessary, so counsel said, for the respondents to plead s 123 expressly as a defence. Even if this were so, it would not affect the outcome of the applicants' summary judgment motion. Let it be assumed that the Amended Defence positively asserted that the marks on the goods in question were applied with the registered owner's consent and the goods were not counterfeit. The respondents placed no evidence before the Court that tended to support this assertion: see Nokia Corporation v Truong [2005] FCA 1141 at [36] per Crennan J. Nor did they place any evidence before the Court that they had any such evidence available to them.\\n\\n41 The pleadings and the evidence lead me to conclude that the first respondent has no reasonable prospects of defending the applicants' trade mark infringement claim.\\n\\n42 Accordingly, providing the applicants file and serve the duly affirmed affidavits of Mr Shepherd and Ms Limpipat today, I would order summary judgment be entered on the trade mark infringement claim against the first respondent, Rosa Dora. I propose to adjourn the matter to enable the parties to prepare draft minutes of order to give effect to these reasons.\"}}"
