I will not reiterate those matters.\\n\\n3 The classes of documents presently in dispute are described as follows in a letter from the solicitors for the applicants to the solicitors for Rosanza dated 15 November 2007:\\n \\n \\n '12. draft(s) of the contract by which the freehold was offered for sale and sold, and all other information disclosed to the purchaser and any other interested party; \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 13. the intended use of the property by the purchaser and any other interested party; \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 14. any investigations in relation to the property undertaken by your client (or its solicitors and other agents) or by the purchaser and any other interested party (including without limitation requisitions on title and replies); and \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 15. consideration by your client and its directors of offers to purchase[; and] \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 16. ... all correspondence and records of communication between your client (or its solicitors and\\/or other agents) and the purchaser (or its solicitors and\\/or other agents) concerning the purchase of the property, the intended use of the property and any claims arising by the purchaser after the sale of the property.'\\n\\n4 Rosanza, by its Further Amended Cross-Claim, alleges various entitlements to damages. The first is an entitlement to damages for lost rent, other outgoings and interest up to and including the date on which the lease of the premises was terminated on 10 May 2007. The second is damages for loss as a result of the cost of restoring and reinstating the premises to a state of good repair. The third is damages for the loss of bargain on the basis that, but for alleged breaches and repudiation of the relevant lease by the applicants, Rosanza would have retained ownership of the premises at least until some time between 12 September 2009 and 2 March 2010, and in that period would have received the benefit of the lease, including rent less expenses. Finally, Rosanza claims for loss in respect of legal and other costs in connection with the default under the lease by the second applicant\\/first cross-respondent.\",\"1\":\"10 In order to justify further discovery beyond that which is verified by an affidavit of a legal practitioner, generally it needs to be shown that there is some substantial or manifest failure to produce documents. Ordinarily, an affidavit of discovery will be conclusive. Insufficiency of discovery may be shown from the pleadings, from the affidavit or from any other source that constitutes an admission of a discoverable document: see Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd [2005] FCA 915. However, in this case, no such insufficiency has been shown. It is important when framing classes for discovery that the classes of documents sought be shown to be relevant to the dispute. That is a consideration, which my comments at [8] above indicate, which applies to some of the classes in this application. This Court will endeavour to limit discovery so far as possible to ensure that it is not excessive, and that only those documents which are necessary to ensure a fair presentation of a party's case are produced: see O 15 r 15 of the Federal Court Rules and Federal Court Practice Note No. 14.\\n\\n11 This application for further discovery is dismissed with costs.\\n \\n \\n I certify that the preceding eleven (11) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Tamberlin. \\n\\n\\n Associate:\\n\\nDated: 7 March 2008\\n\\n\\n Counsel for the Applicants: Mr A.
