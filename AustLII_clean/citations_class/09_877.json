It is for a claimant to advance whatever evidence or arguments he wishes to advance in support of a claim that he has a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason; it is then for the Tribunal to decide whether the claim is made out: Abebe v The Commonwealth of Australia [1999] HCA 14 at [187] , 197 CLR 510 at 576 per Gummow and Hayne JJ. It would be a curious result (and an unacceptable result) if a claimant could unsuccessfully advance some materials and thereafter have an entitlement, perhaps a repeated entitlement, to supplement the original material until he may ultimately prevail. The unacceptability of such a course is only compounded by a claimant shunning an invitation to attend and to participate in a hearing so that the material originally provided could then be discussed.\\n\\nThe passage in the Tribunal's \\\" Findings and Reasons \\\" which is the subject of the final Ground of Appeal , together with the \\\" Conclusions \\\" thereafter expressed, provide as follows: \\n [26] ... I am unable to be satisfied on the evidence before me that, if the applicant returns to Bangladesh now or in the reasonably foreseeable future, there is a real chance that he will be involved in any form of political activity or that he will be persecuted (whether by the Awami League leader and his people, the Awami League more generally, the caretaker government or the army) for reasons of his real or imputed political opinion or for any other Convention reason. \\n \\n \\n CONCLUSIONS \\n\\n \\n [27] I am unable to be satisfied on the evidence before me that the applicant has a well-founded fear of being persecuted for a Convention reason if he returns to Bangladesh now or in the reasonably foreseeable future. It follows that I am not satisfied that the applicant is a person to whom Australia has protection obligations under the Refugees Convention. Consequently the applicant does not satisfy the criterion set out in paragraph 36(2)(a) of the Act for a protection visa.\\n\\nBy reference to the reasons for decision of the Federal Magistrate, it is understood that \\\" the applicant contended that the Tribunal had acted in excess of its jurisdiction by giving him a guarantee that he would not have any real chance of persecution ...\\\". But, as correctly observed by the Federal Magistrate, no such \\\" guarantee \\\" was given. The conclusion of the Tribunal was that it was \\\" unable to be satisfied on the evidence \\\" that the now Appellant would be \\\" involved in any form of political activity or that he will be persecuted ... \\\".\",\"1\":\"Second, if the Ground is intended to convey that the Tribunal should have placed greater weight upon the claims being advanced, notwithstanding the fact that the now Appellant elected not to appear before the Tribunal, the weight to be given to the evidence advanced is a matter for the Tribunal \\u2014 and not a matter for the Federal Magistrate or this Court on appeal: Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 291 to 292 per Kirby J.\\n\\nThis Ground is without substance.\\n\\nThe second Ground of Appeal , again construed as a contention that the Federal Magistrate erred in not concluding that there had been a failure on the part of the Tribunal to comply with s 424A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth), is also to be rejected.\",\"2\":\"The Notice of Appeal , however, fails to identify any ground upon which it is said that the Federal Magistrate has erred.

In Sathiyanathan v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCAFC 210 Finn, Marshall and Goldberg JJ correctly observed: \\n [10] ... that much of the appellant's submissions were directed to the proposition that the Tribunal had made errors in the way it had considered the evidence and issues before it. Although this occurred under the rubric of a consideration of the primary judge's reasons it was of little assistance in understanding why it was said that the primary judge fell into error.
