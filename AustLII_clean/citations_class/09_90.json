His Honour rejected that complaint, referring to an authority of the Full Court of the Federal Court in Appellant P119\\/2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 230.\\n\\nThe appellant appeared in person this morning. She was assisted by a Mandarin interpreter. She addressed me orally on the grounds of appeal, which essentially amount to a re-argument of the grounds of review which were rejected by Scarlett FM.\\n\\nAs I have already said, the first ground falls into two parts. The appellant expanded very slightly on the first part of this ground this morning. She said that she had been nervous and under what she called \\\"spiritual pressure\\\". In my view, this ground must be rejected for the reasons given by Scarlett FM in [22] of his reasons.\",\"1\":\"There was nothing in the reasons for decision of the Tribunal or in the evidence which revealed the slightest suggestion that the Presiding Member approached the review with a closed mind, see Minister For Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia Legeng [2001] HCA 17 ; (2001) 205 CLR 507.\\n\\nThe appellant argued the second ground upon the basis of a breach of section 424A of the Act. She was unable to identify precisely what information the Tribunal was required to disclose to her, but the effect of what she said was that the Tribunal ought to have provided her with information about the inconsistencies in her evidence, so as to give her an opportunity to address those inconsistencies.\",\"2\":\"The second part of this claim was the claim of a reasonable apprehension of bias. Scarlett FM set out the test stated by the High Court in Re Refugee Review Tribunal; ex parte H [2001] HCA 28 ; (2001) 179 ALR 425. His Honour was of the view that there was nothing in the Tribunal's reasons or in the evidence which disclosed a reasonable apprehension of bias within the test stated by the High Court.\\n\\nThe second ground of review was that the Tribunal failed to comply with its obligations under section 424AA of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (\\\"the Act\\\"). His Honour approached the matter upon the basis that the word \\\"information\\\" in section 424AA has the same meaning as it has in section 424A(1).\\n\\nThe answer to this submission is to be found in the observations of the High Court in Re Refugee Review Tribunal; ex parte H at [30]. Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Gummow JJ there said that: \\n Where, as in the present case, credibility is in issue, the person conducting inquisitorial proceedings will necessarily have to test the evidence presented often vigorously.\\n\\nTheir Honours also said at [30] that: \\n [T]he need to ensure that the person who will be affected by the decision is accorded procedural fairness will often require that he or she be plainly confronted with matters which bear adversely on his or her credit or which bring his or her account into question.\",\"3\":\"Scarlett FM was of the view that there was no information that would come under the purview of section 424A(1) of the Act and he observed, at [26], that the decision of the High Court in SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) 235 ALR 609 at [18] is authority for the proposition that inconsistencies in an applicant's evidence do not amount to information for the purposes of section 424A.\\n\\nThe third ground of review was that the Tribunal made its finding without any substantial ground apart from its assumption. Scarlett FM, at [27], was of the view that this ground could not be maintained because it was an attempt to seek merits review which, of course, is not available in the Federal Magistrates Court.\\n\\nIt is well established that the Tribunal's disbelief of an applicant's evidence arising from inconsistencies in it cannot be characterised as constituting \\\"information\\\" within section 424A(1): see SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) 235 ALR 609 at [18]. Accordingly, this ground of appeal must also be rejected.\\n\\nThe third ground of appeal was said to be unfairness. The appellant claimed that she had been treated unfairly, because the Tribunal described her evidence as \\\"vague\\\".\\n\\nThis is not an accurate description of the Tribunal's reasons. As I said earlier, it rejected the appellant as a witness of truth. It said, at [70], that its: \\n ...overall impression is that the Applicant has taken a couple of true facts from her past and, possibly with external assistance, ... heavily interlaced them with false information.\",\"4\":\"Whether this issue is approached upon the basis of a claimed contravention of section 424A(1) or section 424AA , the result is the same. There is authority for the proposition that \\\"information\\\" in section 424AA has the same meaning as \\\"information\\\" under section 424A: SZLXI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1270 at [27] per Cowdroy J.\"}}"
