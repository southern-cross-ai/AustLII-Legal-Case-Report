His Honour at par 7 ( SZCJR & Ors v Minister for Immigration & Anor (No 2) [2006] FMCA 640) found that the Tribunal's decision in this case was simply one of failure of satisfaction due to the lack of detail in the appellants' submissions.\\n\\nThe appellants sought to appeal to this Court by way of unparticularised notice of appeal filed by the appellants on 18 April 2006. The notice of appeal stated that the Federal Magistrate's reasons for judgment had not yet been received by the appellant and that grounds would be provided once the judgment was received. The notice of appeal was accepted for filing by the New South Wales Registry of the Federal Court.\\n\\nOn 27 July 2006 the Registry contacted the appellants and advised them that grounds of appeal had not been received for filing. The appellants filed a document on 28 July 2006 which outlined their grounds and particulars of appeal. This document was also accepted by the Court. The appellants' grounds of appeal were, inter alia : \\u2022 the Tribunal failed to provide the appellants with notice of the adverse information which was used to make the decision to reject the application \\u2022 the Tribunal failed to provided the appellants with an opportunity to comment on the country information on India which was used to make the decision to reject the application \\u2022 the Tribunal did not provide the appellants with an opportunity to comment on the inconsistencies between the information in the Department's decision and the Tribunal's decision \\u2022 there was a denial of natural justice.\",\"2\":\"I understand that the adverse information which the appellants say the Tribunal failed to provide to them in contravention of s 424A(1) of the Act, and which was used to make the decision to reject the application, was information which the appellants provided to the Department when the decision to refuse the visas was made.
