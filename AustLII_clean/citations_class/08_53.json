At [43] his Honour said:\\n \\n 'But as Chernov JA makes plain, conduct is only misleading or deceptive if it is capable of inducing error. Whether it is misleading or deceptive is therefore a question of fact to be determined in the context of the known facts and circumstances. In the end, conduct cannot be characterised as misleading or deceptive unless it conveys a misrepresentation. And if the circumstances of its communication, and the state of knowledge of the recipient, are such as to prevent misrepresentation, it matters not that in other circumstances the result could have been different.'\\n\\n178 In each proceeding the application must be dismissed with costs.\\n\\n179 No substantive attempt was made by 1800 and the Jacobsons to press their amended cross-claims against Bannerhey and the Grettons or against the Hortons, apart from four paragraphs at the conclusion of the respondents' written submissions, and even they were confined to the alleged undischarged obligations of the applicants to pay the amounts to the respective Territory Promotion Funds pursuant to clause 14.16.1 of the respective Master Licence Agreements - $50,000 in the case of Bannerhey and $100,000 in the case of the Hortons. The applicants both submitted that the cross-claims were baseless given the respondents misleading and deceptive conduct. Effectively, there was no other submission.\"}}"
