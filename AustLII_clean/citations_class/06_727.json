However, O 35A r 3(2)(c) permits the Court to grant relief if:\\n \\n\\u2022 a respondent is in default;\\n \\n\\u2022 the applicant appears entitled to the relief 'on the statement of claim'; and\\n \\n\\u2022 the Court is satisfied that it has power to grant the relief.\",\"1\":\"8 Order 35A has been interpreted as dispensing with the invariable requirement that the applicant prove by evidence that the pleaded claim is well-founded.

Order 35A r 3 has been applied where an applicant seeks relief of this kind (as distinct, for example, from damages), in consequence of default by a respondent: Arthur v Vaupotic Investments Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 433.\\n\\n10 For myself, I am inclined to think that some caution should be exercised before granting default relief of the kind sought in this case simply on the basis of the pleadings. In particular, the sanctions that can be invoked where a respondent contravenes a restraining order should be borne in mind. Order 35A r 3 vests a discretion in the Court. Depending on the circumstances, it may be appropriate for the Court to require some evidence, for example, that the respondent has infringed an applicant's copyright as alleged in the statement of claim before making restraining orders or orders requiring a respondent to deliver up on oath infringing copies of copyright material (as the applicants seek here).\\n\\n11 In the present case, Mr Cobden SC, who appeared with Ms Richardson for the applicants, read a number of affidavits in support of the motion. These satisfy me that the respondent has infringed the copyright of the various applicants in the identified films by selling or offering for sale DVDs that constitute copies of the films. The evidence also satisfies me that, unless restrained, the respondent is likely to continue his infringing activities. The evidence also supports the other relief sought by the applicants. There is therefore no need to consider whether it would have been appropriate, in the absence of such evidence, to grant the restraining orders sought by the applicants on the basis of the pleadings alone.\",\"3\":\"12 The restraining orders the applicants seek have been carefully drawn and follow the form approved by the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria in Chappell & Co Ltd v Associated Radio Co of Australia Ltd [1925] VLR 350, at 362-363. Indeed, the orders proposed in the present case are somewhat narrower than those made in Chappell v Associated Radio .\\n\\n13 In summary, I am satisfied that:\\n \\n\\u2022 the respondent is in default for the purposes of O 35A r 3(2);\\n \\n\\u2022 each of the applicants appears entitled to relief in the form of restraining orders on the statement of claim;\\n \\n\\u2022 the Court has power to grant the relief sought; and\\n \\n\\u2022 it is appropriate for the Court to exercise its discretion so as to make the orders sought.\\n\\n14 Accordingly, I propose to make the orders sought by the applicants in the motion. These include restraining orders, an order for delivery up on oath of the infringing copies of the applicants' films and an inquiry as to damages.\\n \\n\\n I certify that the preceding fourteen (14) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Sackville. \\n\\nAssociate:\\n\\nDated: 9 June 2006\\n\\n\\n Counsel for the Applicants: Mr R Cobden SC with Ms K Richardson \\n \\n Solicitor for the Applicants: Minter Ellison \\n \\n There was no appearance by the Respondent \\n \\n Date of Hearing: 8 June 2006 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 9 June 2006 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2006\\/727.html\"}}"
