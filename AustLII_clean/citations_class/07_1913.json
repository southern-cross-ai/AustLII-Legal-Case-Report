His Honour there stated that if a decision-maker intends to reject the application by reference to some consideration personal to the applicant on the basis of information obtained from another source which has not been dealt with by an applicant, there may be a case for saying that procedural fairness requires he be given an opportunity to respond.\\n\\n24 However, the substance of Mr Rivera's complaint under this ground is that there were matters passing between the Department of Corrective Services (\\\"the DCS\\\") and the Commission of which Mr Rivera was not on notice. He submitted that it is to be inferred from the fax of 30 August 2007 that there must have been other communications between the DCS and the Commission, possibly oral communications of which Mr Rivera was not aware.\\n\\n25 The short answer to this ground is that Mr Rivera was well on notice of the critical issue or factor on which the decision of 13 September 2007 turned. He was informed in the letter of 30 May 2007 that the President may decline to continue the inquiry if the President were to form the opinion that a more appropriate remedy was available in civil litigation seeking damages.\",\"2\":\"37 Nor can it be said that the decision was so unreasonable that no reasonable decision-maker could properly have arrived at it: see Buck v Bavone [1976] HCA 24 ; (1976) 135 CLR 110 at 118-119.
