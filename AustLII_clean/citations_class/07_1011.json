Consequently, the Court has encouraged negotiated resolution of proceedings by the ACCC, provided that their terms recognise that the ultimate responsibility for determining the existence of a contravention or contraventions, and as to the proper orders to resolve the proceedings lies with the Court (see Trade Practices Commission v TNT Australia Pty Ltd (1995) ATPR 41-375; NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (1996) 71 FCR 285).\\n\\n72 I must of course be mindful that the respondents are individuals carrying on business, rather than corporate entities, so the penalty factors set out above must be adapted, where possible, to the circumstances of the respondents . I also bear in mind, as Burchett J pointed out in Trade Practices Commission v TNT Australia Pty Ltd (1995) ATPR 41-375 at 40,169, that the total penalty for related offences ought not to exceed what is proper for the entire contravening conduct involved (the 'totality principle' as known in the criminal law).\",\"1\":\"5 Litigation to establish contraventions such as those admitted by Messrs Knight and Ross can be very complex, time consuming and costly.

In that case, the Court held at 298 299: \\n \\n We agree with the statement made in several of the cases cited that it is not actually useful to investigate whether, unaided by the agreement of the parties, we would have arrived at the very figure they propose. The question is not that; it is simply whether, in the performance of the Court's duty under section 76 , this particular penalty, proposed with the consent of the corporation involved and of the Commission, is one that the Court should determine to be appropriate.\\n\\n9 The Full Court further stated at 291:\\n \\n There is an important public policy involved. When corporations acknowledge contraventions, very lengthy and complex litigation is frequently avoided, freeing the courts to deal with other matters, and investigating officers of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to turn to other areas of the economy that await their attention. At the same time, a negotiated resolution in the instant case may be expected to include measures designed to promote, for the future, vigorous competition in the particular market concerned. These beneficial consequences would be jeopardised if corporations were to conclude that proper settlements were clouded by unpredictable risks. A proper figure is one within the permissible range in all the circumstances. The Court will not depart from an agreed figure merely because it might otherwise have been disposed to select some other figure, or except in a clear case.\\n\\n10 The Full Court noted (at 290) that generally the most significant and relevant matters that the Court needed to consider about penalty were effects upon the functioning of markets and other economic effects. Although the Court is responsible for determining the appropriate penalty, the Full Court considered that it would be informed by the views of the ACCC about those effects.\\n\\n11 The decision of the Full Court in NW Frozen Foods 71 FCR 285 was followed by a later Full Court in Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd (2004) ATPR 41-993. In that case, the Full Court at 48,626 also said that it considered that the following proposition emerged from NW Frozen Foods 71 FCR 285:\\n \\n ...the views of the regulator on matters within its expertise (such as the ACCC's views as to the deterrent effect of a proposed penalty in a given market) will usually be given greater weight than its views on more 'subjective' matters.\\n\\n71 Those considerations were approved and expanded upon by the Full Court of the Federal Court in NW Frozen Foods 71 FCR 285 and by Heerey J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v J McPhee & Son (Australia) Pty Ltd (1998) ATPR 41-628 to include:\\n \\n(a) whether the person has previously been found by the Court to have engaged in similar conduct (a matter required to be taken into account by section 76);\\n \\n(b) the effect on the functioning of the market and other economic effects of the conduct;\\n \\n(c) the financial position of the contravening company; and\\n \\n(d) whether the conduct was systematic, deliberate or covert.\\n\\n73 It has long been accepted that a principal object of a penalty under s 76 is deterrence (see Trade Practices Commission v Stihl Chain Saws (Aust) Pty Ltd (1978) ATPR 40-091 at 17,896 per Smithers J). In Trade Practices Commission v CSR Ltd (1991) ATPR 41-076 at 52,152, French J stated:\\n \\n The principal, and I think probably the only, object of the penalties imposed by s. 76 is to attempt to put a price on contravention that is sufficiently high to deter repetition by the contravener and by others who might be tempted to contravene the Act.\\n \\n\\nThis approach was approved by the majority of the Full Federal Court in NW Frozen Foods 71 FCR 285 .\\n\\n74 Deterrence has two aspects: specific deterrence in respect of the actual contravener and general deterrence of others \\\"who may be disposed to engage in prohibited conduct of a similar kind\\\" ( Trade Practices Commission v Mobil Oil Australia Ltd (1984) 4 FCR 296 at 298, per Toohey J). The Full Court in NW Frozen Foods 71 FCR 285 made it clear (at 294-295) that:\\n \\n The Court should not leave room for any impression of weakness in its resolve to impose penalties sufficient to ensure the deterrence, not only of the parties actually before it, but also of others who might be tempted to think that contravention would pay ...\",\"2\":\"7 The principles governing whether a Court should accept a penalty that has been agreed between the ACCC and a respondent were considered in Trade Practices Commission v Allied Mills Industries Pty Ltd (No 4) (1981) 37 ALR 256 by Sheppard J, who stated at 259:\\n \\n It is, of course, true that the penalty has been suggested to me by the agreement of the parties. Uninformed of their agreement, I may have selected a different figure, but I am satisfied that it would not have been very different from theirs. There is from time to time, amongst members of the profession and amongst the public, discussion concerning plea bargaining. Sometimes it is suggested that it involves disreputable conduct. It is my opinion that that is so if it at all implicates the court in private discussions as to what the court's attitude will or would be likely to be if a particular course is taken. In this case nothing of that kind has occurred. The parties have made their own agreement and put it to the court for approval, not knowing what its attitude was likely to be. ... This, of course, is not a criminal case; the liability is civil only. But, even in the most serious criminal cases, it is not unusual for the prosecution to accept a plea to a lesser charge, subject always to the approval of the court. I have said what I have only to explain that the course which the parties have adopted is both proper and not uncommon, even though perhaps novel in the comparatively new field of trade practices.\",\"3\":\"11 The decision of the Full Court in NW Frozen Foods 71 FCR 285 was followed by a later Full Court in Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd (2004) ATPR 41-993.

The power of the court to make the orders sought is \\\"defined and conferred by public law not by private agreement\\\": Fiss, \\\"Against Settlement\\\" (1984) 93 Yale Law Journal 1073. In the exercise of that power the court is not merely giving effect to the wishes of the parties, it is exercising a public function and must have regard to the public interest in doing so. This principle applies to the resolution of private litigation by consent orders or undertakings. A fortiori it applies to proceedings brought by the Crown or public or statutory authorities to enforce the law in the public interest. The court has a responsibility to be satisfied that what is proposed is not contrary to the public interest and is at least consistent with it ... Consideration of the public interest, however, must also weigh the desirability of non-litigious resolution of enforcement proceedings . (emphasis added).\\n\\n13 There have been many other decisions of the Court applying those general principles.\\n\\n14 As I indicated at the close of submissions, I am satisfied that each of the declarations proposed is appropriate and is within power.

The matters they address are far from hypothetical, and the proposed declarations specifically address the particular contravening conduct on the part of Mr Knight and Mr Ross which has been established: see Rural Press Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2003] HCA 75 ; (2003) 216 CLR 53.\\n\\n67 Section 86C of the TPA contains the power to order a contravenor of a provision of the TPA to attend a compliance program. The text of the Code includes that (and other) provisions of the TPA which relate to the Schedule version of Part IV: see s 4(1)(b) of the Competition Policy Reform (South Australia) Act 1996 (SA). The proposed order that each of Mr Knight and Mr Ross attend a trade practices compliance program is therefore within power. As it is agreed that their contravening conduct was engaged in ignorance of the relevant provisions of the Code, it is appropriate that they should attend such a program provided it is relevant to the contraventions. The proposed order satisfies that proviso and is sufficiently clear and precise to enable the performance of it to be readily undertaken and assessed.\\n\\n68 The proposed orders for costs are also clearly within the Court's power and are appropriate.\",\"13\":\"70 Section 76 of the Code and of the TPA sets out matters to which the Court must have regard in determining an appropriate level of penalty. The principles are generally equally relevant to the assessment of a pecuniary penalty under the Code. They were addressed by French J in Trade Practices Commission v CSR Limited (1991) ATPR 41-076 at 52,152 - 52,153. French J, dealing with a corporation not an individual, formulated these as follows:\\n \\n(a) the nature and extent of the contravening conduct;\\n \\n(b) the amount of loss or damage caused;\\n \\n(c) the circumstances in which the conduct took place;\\n \\n(d) the size of the contravening company;\\n \\n(e) the degree of power it has, as evidenced by its market share and ease of entry into the market;\\n \\n(f) the deliberateness of the contravention and the period over which it extended;\\n \\n(g) whether the contravention arose out of the conduct of senior management or at a lower level;\\n \\n(h) whether the company has a corporate culture conducive to compliance with the Act, as evidenced by educational programs and disciplinary or other corrective measures in response to an acknowledged contravention; and\\n \\n(i) whether the company has shown a disposition to co-operate with the authorities responsible for the enforcement of the Act in relation to the contravention.\\n\\n73 It has long been accepted that a principal object of a penalty under s 76 is deterrence (see Trade Practices Commission v Stihl Chain Saws (Aust) Pty Ltd (1978) ATPR 40-091 at 17,896 per Smithers J).

Obviously the sum required to achieve this object will be larger where the Court is setting a penalty for a company with vast resources.
