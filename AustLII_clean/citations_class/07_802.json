There may be good reasons for requiring that the applicant affirm or actively give specific 'information' for the purposes of the review, in order for the exemption in s 424A(3)(b) to apply. Both SZEEU and NAZY suggest that the exception may not apply where the appellant does no more than affirm the accuracy of a statement which contains many diverse pieces of information. At the same time, the weight of authority indicates that artificial distinctions should not be drawn between information that is provided by an applicant in the course of his evidence-in-chief rather than in answer to questions posed by the Tribunal.\\n \\n In the present case, the relevant information was uncontentious factual material that formed an essential element of the decisions which were under review by the tribunal. The appellant either expressly provided or affirmed the relevant dates in response to basic propositions put by the tribunal at the hearing. The tribunal's questions arose naturally from the appellant's application. In these circumstances, and given the uncontentious factual nature of the information, I consider that the exemption in s 424A(3)(b) applies.\\n \\n The appellant expressly stated the date of her arrival in Australia to the tribunal at the hearing. I do not accept the appellant's argument that s 424A(3)(b) cannot apply because the date was given in response to a question posed by the tribunal. The mere fact that the tribunal elicited a response from the appellant, which confirmed an uncontentious detail of her application, does not render the information incapable of falling within the exemption in s 424A(3)(b). It is not inconsistent with NAZY or SZEEU to hold that the exemption applies in such circumstances, given the nature of the information and the context in which it was communicated.\\n \\n I also find that the appellant 'gave' the date of her arrival in Australia and the approximate date of her protection visa application via her visa application and the written submissions provided to the tribunal by the appellant's adviser. The appellant affirmed that the details of her application were correct. The written submissions contained a statement which expressly referred to the appellant's statement attached to her protection visa application. In that statement, which was dated 17 November 2004, the appellant said that she 'came to Australia on strength of a 457 working visa on 12.3.99'. Thus, for the purposes of s 424A(3)(b) , the information was given in the written submissions: VWBF at [51].\\n \\n\\nOn the basis of that approach, the first respondent contended that such information as the Tribunal relied upon was information given to the Tribunal by the appellant at the hearing so as to fall within the exemption in s 424A(3)(b) to the operation of 424A(1).\\n\\n30 Clearly, s 424A(3)(b) must be carefully applied according to its terms. It exempts from the operation of s 424A(1) information which the appellant gave to the Tribunal for the purpose of the application to the Tribunal. And the observations of Young J in NBKT [2006] FCAFC 195 ; 93 ALD 333 indicate that the question of fact as to whether particular information has been given to the Tribunal may sometimes be a difficult one, and sometimes the line between giving information to the Tribunal and between adverting in a general way to a collection of material (such as the material presented to the first respondent in support of an application for a protection visa) in a hearing before the Tribunal may be a fine one. Each case must be looked at on its own particular facts. By way of a comparison with the facts in NBKT [2006] FCAFC 195 ; 93 ALD 333, in SZGGD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1138 at [69] Jessup J concluded that the fact that that appellant's protection visa application contained a particular explanation for the death of his mother, which differed from that advanced by him at the hearing before the Tribunal, was a part of the reason for the Tribunal affirming the decision under review. The fact that he had conveyed that particular explanation in his protection visa information was accepted to be \\\"information\\\" within the terms of s 424A(1) of the Act and had not been given by that appellant in that case to the Tribunal. Consequently, his Honour concluded that there had been a failure to comply with s 424A(1) of the Act.\",\"8\":\"29 Alternatively, the first respondent contended, albeit perhaps with less enthusiasm, that the appellant before the Tribunal had adopted what he had put in his protection visa application and the accompanying statutory declaration subject to any additional qualifications, so that he \\\"gave\\\" the statutory declaration to the Tribunal for the purposes of his application for review: cf Applicant S301\\/2003 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 155 at [17] .\\n\\n36 It is not therefore necessary to consider the first respondent's alternative contention that the appellant, by explaining the circumstances in which the protection visa application and the accompanying statutory declaration had been made, had given to the Tribunal all the contents of the statutory declaration. There is, however, some apparent merit in that contention that he had thereby provided that material to the Tribunal, not as truthful information but as to the fact of having earlier given that information: cf Applicant S301\\/2003 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 155.\\n\\n37 The second proposed ground of appeal involves identifying that the appellant did claim to have been persecuted by reason of his membership of a particular social group. The Tribunal acknowledged such a claim, but identified it as a claim of membership of a particular social group, being Buddhist monks. The appellant contends that his relevant social group was those involved in welfare activities for the Buddhist community, that is religious activists and social organisers within that community.\",\"9\":\"30 Clearly, s 424A(3)(b) must be carefully applied according to its terms. It exempts from the operation of s 424A(1) information which the appellant gave to the Tribunal for the purpose of the application to the Tribunal. And the observations of Young J in NBKT [2006] FCAFC 195 ; 93 ALD 333 indicate that the question of fact as to whether particular information has been given to the Tribunal may sometimes be a difficult one, and sometimes the line between giving information to the Tribunal and between adverting in a general way to a collection of material (such as the material presented to the first respondent in support of an application for a protection visa) in a hearing before the Tribunal may be a fine one.

Their Honours said that the Tribunal may be required to consider a claim not expressed by the visa applicant but open on the facts, provided it is squarely raised, that is provided that it is apparent on the face of the material before the Tribunal. They said at 19, [60], that the Tribunal is not obliged to deal with claims which are not articulated and which do not \\\"clearly arise before from the materials it\\\". In that case, no jurisdictional error was found to exist because the putative social group put forward by the appellant was not in respect of a group which was a \\\"substantial clearly articulated argument relying upon established facts\\\".\\n\\n41 In the submissions, counsel for the appellant referred to several passages in the material before the Tribunal which were said to have identified the nature of the claim, even if not expressly articulated.\\n\\n42 \\n \\nThey were firstly in the appellant's statutory declaration accompanying the protection visa application. (I put aside the fact that the first proposed ground of appeal is premised upon the basis that the document was not provided to the Tribunal by the appellant, and that the appellant asked the Tribunal to place no or little weight on it). It generally refers to the appellant's father in 1994 being involved with religious activities in their home area, and helping other community members, including helping to organise a religious festival which led to a hostile atmosphere between Buddhists and Muslims in the area. It also refers to the appellant from mid 2000 as a Buddhist monk engaging in community activities, and from May 2001 in religious activities in his family region where he attracted the attention of local fundamentalist Muslims. The concluding parts of that statement complains of discrimination against Buddhists generally in Bangladesh, and as he devoted himself to their interests in his family region of him attracting \\\"fierce enmity\\\" from the leaders of the local society. He then asserts having been persecuted \\\"for my faith in Buddhist religion\\\", including \\\"selective harassment of the person as an individual or a member of a group\\\". (That last reference is one of six descriptions of persecution, the others of which do not apparently focus upon the appellant as distinct from other Buddhists. The statutory declaration accompanied the protection visa application, which identified the fear of persecution as being for his religious belief.\\n\\n45 In my judgment, the second proposed ground of appeal must also fail. Upon analysis of the appellant's claims as presented to the Tribunal, he did not positively identify a claim based other than upon his religious beliefs as a Buddhist monk. Specifically, he did not either expressly, or by the articulation of the material he relied upon, identify separately a social group comprising socially active or politically active Buddhist welfare workers within the Buddhist community. At one point, his migration agent in a submission to the Tribunal describes him as \\\"a social organiser within his community\\\" but there is no identification of a separate and refined social group of the type now asserted: cf NABE 144 FCR at 21, [68]. The fact is, in my view, that no social group of that character was suggested to the Tribunal: cf STCB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 61 ; (2006) 231 ALR 556 at [39] .\",\"13\":\"45 In my judgment, the second proposed ground of appeal must also fail.
