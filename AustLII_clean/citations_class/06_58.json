Counsel for the respondent submitted it was open to the Tribunal to do so. Counsel for the applicant submitted, in effect, that a s 14 determination was immune from reconsideration by the Tribunal, including the facts underpinning it, unless the reviewable decision before the Tribunal was itself a decision under s 62 reconsidering the determination under s 14.'\\n\\n34 In Hannaford , supra, at [29] Moore J said:\\n \\n 'In the second emphasised passage, Sackville J was indicating that Comcare could, when reconsidering issues of liability under provisions such as s 24 and s 27, revisit factual issues founding an earlier determination under s 14 even though there was no reconsideration being undertaken of that earlier determination under s 62. In so doing, it was open to Comcare to reach conclusions on matters of fact inconsistent with those founding the earlier s 14 determination.'\\n\\n36 The same question of law was recently considered by Moore J in Hannaford , supra, which I understand is presently on appeal to the Full Court. At [43] his Honour said:\\n \\n 'The Full Court indicated at [39] of its judgment [in Lees ] ... that the powers and discretions exercisable by the Tribunal in reviewing a reviewable decision are limited to the powers that could have been exercised by the person who had reconsidered the determination or determinations under s 62 and who made the reviewable decision. It is not a large step to say, and it would be consistent with the approach taken by the Full Court, that the power to make a finding about one of the five matters arising under s 14, inconsistent with findings earlier made in a determination under that section, exists only when the decision maker is reconsidering that determination and not otherwise. If that is correct then the Tribunal only has power to make a finding that a claimant did or did not suffer from a disease or injury and, if so, the disease or injury had the requisite connection with the employment when the reviewable decision entailed a reconsideration of the determination made under s 14. In my opinion, this is the way the Act (together with the AAT Act) was intended to operate having regard to the Full Court's construction of various provisions of the Act.'\\n\\n41 What is said in [40], is exemplified in Hannaford itself. First, it has the potential to lead to a situation where a claimant must repay money paid under one or a number of determinations made under other sections unless the relevant body exercises its power under s 114D of the SRC Act to waive its right to recover, assuming the power of waiver under that provision so extends. Second, it will be an exercise in futility for the applicant, in cases such as this, because as was said by his Honour at [47]:\\n \\n 'Potentially the applicant will gain little from his success in these proceedings as the determination under s 14 may be reconsidered and revoked under s 62 for the reasons which prompted the Tribunal to determine the matter as it did.'\\n\\n42 For the foregoing reasons, I do not think the ground of appeal can be sustained, but even if I am wrong, and it was not open to the Tribunal to make the first finding at [101], I do not think this infects the second finding at [101] namely, that Mr Riddle's impairment was as a result of natural progression of his degenerative lumbar spine and was not attributable to the nature and conditions of his employment, a finding, as I observed at [29], which was not inconsistent with any findings underpinning the s 14 determination because none of the findings went that far.\\n\\n43 For the foregoing reasons, this ground of appeal must fail.\",\"5\":\"14 The applicant submitted that the Tribunal wrongly assumed for itself power to exercise jurisdiction under s 62(1) of the SRC Act reconsideration of a determination by a determining authority on its own motion and purported to exercise that jurisdiction. In support of this submission, the applicant pointed to [43] and [48] of the Tribunal's reasons in particular, the Tribunal's observation at [43] that it had been submitted by the respondent '... that on the basis of the evidence, the Tribunal could find that section 14 liability ought never to have been accepted in relation to Mr Riddle ...' and its observations at [48]:\\n \\n 'The Tribunal has noted the submissions of the parties, and relies on the powers regarding reconsideration of own motion accorded to the Commonwealth pursuant to section 62(1) of the Act, and the jurisdiction of the Tribunal ( Lees [v Comcare (1999) 56 ALD 84] (supra)).'\\n\\n15 I cannot accept, by reference to these passages from the Tribunal's reasons, that it was purporting to exercise jurisdiction under s 62(1). Counsel for the applicant relied on the Tribunal's findings at [94] and [95] of its reasons that it '... was satisfied in relation to Mr Riddle's back pain, that there was only a temporal, and no causal connection with the employment ...' and that it '... was not satisfied that Mr Riddle suffers permanent impairment of the lumbar spine arising out of an injury or aggravation he suffered on the way home from work on 19 February 2003' for a submission that this involved a consideration of s 14 liability, presumably made under s 62(1). Likewise, he relied on the Tribunal's finding at [101] of its reasons that it '... was satisfied ... that Mr Riddle had not suffered a disc lesion or other injury or aggravation on the way home from work on 19 February 2003, and that his impairment was as a result of the natural progression of his degenerative lumbar spine, and was not attributable to the nature and conditions of his employment' for a submission that this involved a consideration of s 14 liability, again presumably made under s 62(1).\\n\\n16 I cannot agree. The Tribunal made it clear at [9] of its reasons that liability pursuant to s 14(1) of the SRC Act was not in question, but even if it was, the Tribunal's reasons do not provide a sufficient basis for a presumption that such consideration was made under s 62(1).\\n\\n26 In Lees v Comcare (1999) 56 ALD 84, the Full Court said at [35]:\\n \\n '... a determination under s 14 ... will involve findings on the following matters. First, that an appropriate notice of injury has been given to the relevant authority as required by s 53 of the Act; secondly, that a claim for compensation has been made as required by s 54 of the Act; thirdly, that the person who made the claim or on whose behalf the claim was made was \\\"an employee\\\" at the time of the alleged injury (ss 4 and 5); fourthly, that the employee suffered an injury (s 4); and finally, that the injury has resulted in death, incapacity for work or impairment.'\\n\\n27 These observations were part of an overall review of the scheme of the SRC Act and the place of a determination under s 14 in that scheme. But they were not critical to the decision in either appeal that was before the Court and therefore do not think that, persuasive as they may be, having been embraced in subsequent decisions of single judges of the Court, they are binding upon me. In any event, my departure is small, even if important. I do not think that a determination under s 14 necessarily involves the final finding that the injury 'has resulted in' death, incapacity for work or impairment. It may, but it may not. Such a finding, it seems to me, is ultimately a matter for determination under ss 17, 19 or 24, not s 14. The wording of s 14 is '... if the injury results in death, incapacity for work or impairment' . Thus, a determination under s 14 may determine that Comcare (or a body in a similar position such as the respondent) is liable to pay compensation in respect of an injury suffered by an employee before it results in death, incapacity for work or impairment, on the basis that it will only be so liable 'if the injury results' in death, incapacity for work or impairment. And that is what seems to have occurred in this case. The s 14 determination involved no finding that Mr Riddle's injury had resulted in death, incapacity for work or impairment. The Statement of Reasons merely said:\\n \\n \\n '5. In order for compensation benefits to be payable, I must be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the claimant sustained an injury, namely aggravation of pre-existing spinal canal stenosis at L4\\/5 , which has arisen out of or in the course of his employment with Telstra. I have relied on the specialist opinion of Dr Nall in making a decision and that there is no evidence presently available to indicate that the injury did not arise out of or in the course of the claimant's employment.' \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\nThe s 14 determination undoubtedly involved findings on the first four matters referred to in the extract from the Full Court's judgment in [26], but not the final matter.\\n\\n28 It follows, in my view, that the Tribunal's findings at [94] and [95] of its reasons that, in relation to Mr Riddle's back pain, there was only a temporal, and no causal connection with the employment; and that having reviewed the medical evidence, the Tribunal was not satisfied that Mr Riddle suffers permanent impairment of the lumbar spine arising out of an injury or aggravation he suffered on the way home from work on 19 February 2003 were not inconsistent with any findings underpinning the s 14 determination because none of those findings went that far.\\n\\n29 It also follows, in my view, that the Tribunal's second finding at [101] of its reasons that Mr Riddle's impairment was as a result of natural progression of his degenerative lumbar spine and was not attributable to the nature and conditions of his employment was not inconsistent with any findings underpinning the s 14 determination because none of those findings went that far.\\n\\n30 On the other hand, the first finding at [101] of the Tribunal's reasons that Mr Riddle had not suffered a disc lesion, or other injury or aggravation on the way home from work on 19 February 2003 is inconsistent with a finding underpinning the s 14 determination that Mr Riddle had suffered an injury on that day, namely, aggravation of pre-existing spinal canal stenosis at L4\\/5 , which had arisen out of or in the course of his employment with Telstra.\\n\\n36 The same question of law was recently considered by Moore J in Hannaford , supra, which I understand is presently on appeal to the Full Court.

The Tribunal's finding that there had been a temporal connection only between the onset of the applicant's symptoms and his work precludes any finding that the applicant had suffered a work-related disease which was therefore compensable.

His Honour said:\\n \\n 'Only Comcare addressed in submissions the character of the 22 March 1995 decision. In supplementary written submissions, Mr Johnson argued that Comcare's powers under ss 69(a) and 70 of the SRC Act authorised it to make a decision as to whether Comcare continued to be liable to compensate the applicant after March 1995. Mr Johnson did not identify explicitly the sections \\\"under\\\" which any such decision could be made, other than ss 69(a) and 70 (neither of which is referred to in the definition of \\\"determination\\\" in s 60(1) of the SRC Act). However, it was implicit in his submissions that the decision to terminate Comcare's liability to compensate the applicant as from 9 March 1995 was made \\\"under\\\" ss 14 and 19 of the SRC Act . If this is correct, it would follow that Comcare had power to reconsider the decision under s 62. On this analysis, s 43(1) of the AAT Act conferred on the AAT the same powers and discretions as were available to the decision-maker, including the power under s 62(5) to affirm, revoke or vary the delegate's decision that Comcare's liability had ceased from 9 March 1995. \\n \\n I should interpose that it was common ground that the decision of 22 March 1995 was not a reconsideration, pursuant to s 62(1) of the SRC Act, of either the 1990 or the 1993 determinations. In other words, both parties explicitly agreed that Comcare had not purported to exercise the power, conferred by s 62(1) of the SRC Act, to reconsider the earlier determinations on its own motion. I must confess to thinking that, although the delegate who decided to terminate the applicant's compensation for his coronary disease did not direct attention to the source of power for such a decision, the view adopted by the parties is not entirely self-evident, particularly having regard to the breadth of the power in s 62(1) and the absence of a temporal limitation on its exercise: De La Cruz v Australian Postal Commission (1997) 73 FCR 204 at 207-208 per Emmett J. Nonetheless, both parties were adamant on this question and the case proceeded on the basis that the decision of 22 March 1995 was not made pursuant to the power of reconsideration conferred by s 62(1) of the SRC Act. \\n \\n In these circumstances, I accept Mr Johnson's analysis of the nature of the decision of 22 March 1995, namely, that it was made in exercise of the power conferred by s 69(a), but was also a decision under ss 14 and 19 of the SRC Act. This analysis is consistent with the authorities giving a broad construction to the power in s 69(a) of the SRC Act to make \\\"determinations... in relation to claims \\\": Australian Postal Corporation v Nguyen (1996) 71 FCR 516 at 521-522 per Jenkinson J. Moreover, leaving s 62(1) to one side, unless a decision to cease compensation from a particular date is regarded as being made \\\"under\\\" ss 14 or 19 (or both), the claimant adversely affected by the decision would not be entitled to have the decision reconsidered under s 62(2) and, consequently, would not be entitled to seek review by the AAT. Parliament cannot have intended this result. Mr McManamey, who appeared on behalf of the applicant, did not suggest otherwise. \\n \\n The reconsideration decision of 7 April 1995 was made pursuant to s 62(4) of the SRC Act. As I have noted, the decision-maker had power to affirm, revoke or vary the determination made by the delegate on 22 March 1995: s 62(5). For the purpose of reviewing the reconsideration decision (the \\\"reviewable decision\\\"), the AAT could exercise all the powers and discretions conferred by the SRC Act on the reconsideration decision-maker: AAT Act, s 43(1); Fletcher v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) (1988) 19 FCR 442 at 453. The question is then whether the reconsideration decision-maker was entitled to affirm the decision of 22 March 1995, on the basis of a finding that the applicant's coronary disease had never been causally related to his employment. If so, the AAT was also entitled to approach the matter on this basis. \\n \\n I think the better view is that the reconsideration decision-maker, for the purpose of determining whether Comcare had a continuing liability to compensate the applicant for his coronary condition, had power to consider whether that condition had ever been causally related to his work. The question of Comcare's liability arose because Comcare was empowered under s 69(a) of the SRC Act to make a determination \\\"in relation to\\\" the claim made by the applicant to Comcare in about 1990 for compensation for acceleration of his coronary heart disease. It was required to make that determination accurately (s 69(a)) and in accordance with the \\\"substantial merits of the case\\\" (s 72(a)).' (Emphasis added)\\n\\n40 Moore J's observation at [40] that Sackville J in Power , supra, recognised the conclusion he reached was not the only one reasonably open by Sackville J's use of the words 'I think the better view is that ...' in the last paragraph of the quotation in [33] supra may well be right; on the other hand, and with respect, I think Sackville J's view is the better one. Moore J's approach may not, as his Honour says, render the scheme of the SRC Act unworkable, but it has the potential, with respect, to render it cumbersome in determining claims for compensation under specific heads which are rejected, such as in this case, following upon a determination of liability under s 14, unless that determination is itself reconsidered (by the determining authority's own motion) under s 62(1) of the SRC Act.\",\"10\":\"10 The parties agreed before the Tribunal that the decision of 6 January 2004 be set aside: it could not stand in the terms in which it was expressed, since it is not permissible to cease liability 'on and from' , thereby apparently precluding any future claims which may be made: Australian Postal Corporation v Oudyn [2003] FCA 318 and Rosillo v Telstra Corporation Limited [2003] FCA 1628.\",\"11\":\"47 For a disease to be compensable under the SRC Act something more than a mere temporal connection must be found; there must be a material contribution towards either the contraction of the disease or an aggravation of it: See the definition of 'disease' in s 4(1) of the SRC Act and Treloar v Australian Telecommunications Commission (1990) 26 FCR 316.
