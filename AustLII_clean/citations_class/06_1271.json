The appellant submitted that the Tribunal misunderstood the meaning of persecution and \\\"serious harm\\\" for the purposes of the Refugees Convention and s 91R of the Act in finding that the harm that the appellants experienced in the past did not amount to serious harm. In my view the Tribunal did not misunderstand the meaning of either of those terms within the meaning of the Refugees Convention or the Act . It was open at all times to the Tribunal to find that the threats and harassment alleged by the appellant did not amount to serious harm: see generally VBAS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 212 at [17] [28].\\n\\nThe Tribunal simply did not accept the appellant's claims concerning the incidents following the elections in April 2004. It was not satisfied that he was ever harmed as he alleged. The appellant also submitted the Tribunal failed to consider whether the facts as it found them to have occurred led to the conclusion that the appellants had a well-founded fear of persecution for a Refugees Convention reason. However, it is clear to me that the Tribunal did consider the findings of fact and addressed the proper question whether the appellants had a well-founded fear of persecution. The appellant also submitted that the Tribunal misunderstood what follows from its finding that the persecution did not have an \\\"official\\\" quality. But, as was noted by the Federal Magistrate, this submission did not appear to relate to any findings of the Tribunal in the present case.\\n\\nThe appellant submitted that the Tribunal acted in breach of the rules of natural justice by failing to give him an opportunity to respond to adverse material comprising the country information in relation to the 2004 elections cited in the Tribunal's reasons and referred to above. The appellant says that had he been notified of this material he would have provided the Tribunal with information about election-related violence in Sri Lanka.\",\"7\":\"In my view the Tribunal did not deny any procedural fairness to the appellant.
