In consequence of the High Court's decision, on 28 November 2006 the applicant was again taken into immigration detention.\\n\\n18 On 1 December 2006, the applicant was interviewed by a Departmental officer while in detention at Villawood. On 20 December 2006, the Department of Immigration advised the applicant that the previous cancellation of his visa was being reviewed.\",\"2\":\"19 On 23 January 2006, the applicant was released from immigration detention following the decision in Sales v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 1807. This decision apparently was taken to suggest that there may have been a failure to accord the applicant procedural fairness in relation to the earlier cancellation of his visa.\\n\\n20 On 3 April 2007, the Department wrote to the applicant (who was then not in custody) advising that it was giving fresh consideration as to whether his Transitional (Permanent) (BF-C) visa should be cancelled under s 501 of the Migration Act . The letter encouraged the applicant to provide the Department with all information that he wished the Minister, or a delegate, to consider in making the decision.\\n\\n21 On 5 April 2007, the Department sent the applicant a ' NOTICE OF INTENTION TO CONSIDER CANCELLATION OF YOUR VISA UNDER SUB-SECTION 501(2) OF THE MIGRATION ACT 1958 '. The Notice informed the applicant that the information to be relied upon would include his convictions for murder and attempted murder, the sentences imposed in respect of those offences and the redetermination of the sentence for murder that was made on 13 August 1998. The letter advised that the information that might be taken into account included the transcript of proceedings of a number of criminal proceedings involving the applicant, as well as other material specified in the letter. The applicant was further advised that all information that he had previously provided would be taken into account in making the decision. However, he was invited to provide information and comments in relation to the application of the character test and to address any matters that he considered that the Minister should take into account when exercising the statutory discretion.\",\"3\":\"38 The decision by the Minister to cancel the applicant's visa was a ' privative clause decision ': Migration Act s 474(2) , (3)(b). Accordingly, the applicant is entitled to the relief he claims, or some variation thereof, only if he can establish that the Minister has committed jurisdictional error: Migration Act s 474(1) ; Plaintiff S157\\/2002 v Commonwealth (2003) 211 CLR 476. In my opinion, none of the grounds identified by the applicant establishes jurisdictional error by the Minister in connection with the making of the visa cancellation decision.\\n\\n39 The first ground merely asserts the existence of jurisdictional error, without providing particulars or any basis for the assertion.\\n\\n40 The second ground seems to challenge the Minister's conclusion that the applicant had a substantial criminal record for the purposes of s 501(7) of the Migration Act . It is clear, however, that the applicant satisfied the definition. He was initially sentenced to life imprisonment following his conviction for murder and, subsequently, to a redetermined sentence of 21 years, with a minimum custodial term of 16 years.\",\"4\":\"42 While the rules of natural justice (or procedural fairness) apply to the decision in this case, they do not necessarily mean that the Minister was bound to afford the appellant an oral hearing: Heatley v Tasmanian Racing and Gaming Commission [1977] HCA 39 ; (1977) 137 CLR 487 , at 516, per Aickin J; Chen v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1994] FCA 985 ; (1994) 48 FCR 591 , at 597, per curiam .

Her Honour noted (at [41]) that:\\n \\n 'Procedural fairness required that, before any decision was made, the Minister afford the applicant a fair opportunity to present information and argument against the cancellation of his visa. Precisely what constituted a fair opportunity depended on all the circumstances of the case, including the nature of the statutory power in question and the interests promoted by it, the interests of persons affected by the decision, and what was relevantly known by the decision-maker at the time the decision was made.'\\n\\n45 Kenny J acknowledged (at [43]) that any visa cancellation decision made by the Minister has great importance to the person affected. However, her Honour also pointed out that:\\n \\n the power is conferred in order that the Minister can act in the public interest to protect of the Australian community. Under this provision, the legislature has entrusted to the Minister the responsibility for deciding whether the public interest should prevail over the private interest of a visa holder.' \\n \\n\\nAs Gleeson CJ and Gummow J stated in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia [2001] HCA 17 ; (2000) 205 CLR 507 , at 539, the statutory power in s 501 is reposed in a political official, who is a member of the Executive and accountable to Parliament and the electorate. It is therefore unlikely that Parliament contemplated that every visa cancellation decision would require the Minister, as a pre-condition to the exercise of his or her powers, to afford an oral hearing to the visa holder.\\n\\n46 Of course, the requirements of procedural fairness may be onerous, even without an obligation to provide an oral hearing. Procedural fairness requires the visa holder to be given an opportunity to:\\n \\n 'rebut or qualify by further information, and comment by way of submission, upon adverse material from other sources which is put before the decision-maker. It also extends to require the decision-maker to identify to the person affected any issue critical to the decision which is not apparent from its nature or the terms of the statute under which it is made. The decision-maker is required to advise of any adverse conclusion which has been arrived at which would not obviously be open on the known material.' \\n \\n\\n Commissioner for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd [1994] FCA 1074 ; (1994) 49 FCR 576 , at 592, per curiam , cited by Kenny J in M238\\/2002 v Minister , at [44].\",\"7\":\"45 Kenny J acknowledged (at [43]) that any visa cancellation decision made by the Minister has great importance to the person affected.
