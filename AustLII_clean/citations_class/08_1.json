For habeas corpus to issue, an applicant must show that he or she is unlawfully held in the custody or control of the respondent: see Hicks v Ruddock (2007) 156 FCR 575 at 587-592. Mr Rivera's application depends on the assertion that his present detention is unlawful because, once he placed on the commercial airline flight on 22 December 2007, his lawful custody under Australian authorities ceased, and the continuation of his custody since that date is without lawful authority.\\n\\n10 This assertion is without substance because the authority to detain Mr Rivera did not, and indeed could not, terminate at the point at which Mr Rivera boarded the flight.\\n\\n11 The authority to detain did not terminate because the surrender warrant issued by the Minister for Justice and Customs (now styled the Minister for Home Affairs) under s 23 of the Extradition Act 1988 (Cth) on 31 August 2006 authorises Mr Rivera's custody in Australia until he is transported \\\"out of Australia to a place in the United States\\\". Given that the power of the Minister to issue this warrant and include such a condition is not disputed by Mr Rivera in his application of 28 December 2007, it is uncontentious that the warrant, when issued, represented a lawful authorisation of his custody in Australia. In my view, the provision in the warrant that Mr Rivera's custody continue until he is transported \\\"to a place in the United States\\\" which a seat on a commercial airline flight yet to take off patently is not is sufficient basis on which to hold that the warrant still constitutes lawful authorisation of his custody in Australia.\",\"1\":\"2 This application was made subsequent to numerous other applications made by Mr Rivera in this Court since he was placed in custody in Australia in 2002 pending extradition to the United States of America to face charges relating to a murder he is alleged to have committed in California in May 2002. The most recent of these applications was determined by Flick J on 13 December 2007, in which his Honour declined to expedite the hearing of an appeal from the decision of a Judge of the Court which dismissed an application for review of a decision of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission: see Rivera v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission [2007] FCA 2037. The history of some of Mr Rivera's earlier litigation is summarised by Gyles J in Rivera v Minister Administering the Extradition Act 1988 (Cth) [2007] FCAFC 191. It is not necessary for me to repeat or elaborate upon this extensive litigious history.\",\"2\":\"2 This application was made subsequent to numerous other applications made by Mr Rivera in this Court since he was placed in custody in Australia in 2002 pending extradition to the United States of America to face charges relating to a murder he is alleged to have committed in California in May 2002.

The lack of reasonable prospects of success, or where a case is \\\"patently hopeless\\\" or has no \\\"arguable basis\\\", has been regarded by the Court as sufficient reason to refuse a referral under O 80 r 4: see Taylor [2005] FCA 319 at [10] ; Rivera v The Commonwealth of Australia [2007] FCA 1465 at [34] .
