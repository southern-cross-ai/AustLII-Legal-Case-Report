Housewares submits that Bodum's rejection of the first offer of compromise ([12] above) is so unreasonable as to justify indemnity costs.

Bodum took the position that Housewares was not a \\\"person aggrieved\\\" in relation to the first and second designs and, for that reason, rejected the offer to release Housewares from any claim for design infringement in circumstances where Bodum would be liable to pay Housewares' costs. While Housewares was entitled to seek to establish that it was so aggrieved, the cross-claim would fail if Housewares had no standing to bring the action.

A ' close and direct connection in both a legal and practical sense between the existence and duration of the designs and potential damage to the appellant ' was sufficient in Assa Abloy , although Heerey and Allsop JJ thought it inappropriate in that case to express a view as to what the limits may be (at [24]).\",\"2\":\"32 Mere refusal of an offer or a Calderbank offer does not of itself warrant an order for indemnity costs; the offeror needs to show that the conduct of the offeree was unreasonable ( Alpine Hardwoods 190 ALR at [28], [35]; Black v Lipovac (1998) 217 ALR 386 at [217] to [218]).

The media release sent a mixed message to Housewares. It unreasonably provoked Housewares to protect its position and the position of the retailers of its products. Bodum should pay the costs incurred by Housewares in respect of its cross-claim for rectification of the Register of Designs between the issue of the media release on 10 October 2005 and the \\\"clarification\\\" by Bodum on 28 November 2005 on an indemnity basis ( Hamod v New South Wales (2002) 188 ALR 659 at [20]).\\n\\n35 That leaves for consideration whether costs are payable on an indemnity basis after 28 November 2005. By then, Housewares was aware that there was no intention on the part of Bodum to allege design infringement. There was, however, still a dispute as to Housewares' entitlement to bring the cross-claim and costs. Bodum had offered surrender of the designs on the condition that the cross-claim for rectification be discontinued and each party pay its own costs; Housewares had offered to discontinue the cross-claim in return for the surrender of the designs on the condition that Bodum pay its costs. The cross-claim for rectification of the Register of Designs was capable of resolution subject to the dispute as to who should be liable for costs.\\n\\n36 Neither party sought to bring that situation to finality. Neither party approached the Court to finalise the surrender of the designs or the cross-claim and resolve question of costs. Bodum did not approach Housewares or the Court with respect to orders for surrender of the designs. Housewares, knowing of the proposed surrender and the effect on its cross-claim for rectification, did not seek to finalise the matter with Bodum, nor approach the Court for orders as to its cross-claim. That was the time to finalise the status of the cross-claim for rectification and any costs associated with it. Instead, the matter did not progress until after Housewares served a notice to admit facts relevant to the cross-claim and the designs on 23 February 2006. It was entitled to do so because the cross-claim for rectification was still in issue; the designs had not been surrendered. Directions had been made requiring Housewares to prepare its evidence.\",\"4\":\"28 Bodum's submission that Housewares cannot be a \\\"person aggrieved\\\" is not accepted. Those words embrace ' any person having a real interest in having the entry expunged ' and include ' any person who would be or in respect of whom there is a reasonable possibility of his or her being \\\"appreciably disadvantaged in a legal or practical sense\\\" by the entry not being expunged ' ( Assa Abloy Australia Pty Ltd v Australian Lock Company Pty Ltd [2005] FCAFC 246 ; (2005) 147 FCR 126 at [19] ; Ritz Hotel Ltd v Charles of the Ritz Ltd (1988) 15 NSWLR 158 at 193). A ' close and direct connection in both a legal and practical sense between the existence and duration of the designs and potential damage to the appellant ' was sufficient in Assa Abloy , although Heerey and Allsop JJ thought it inappropriate in that case to express a view as to what the limits may be (at [24]).\\n\\n39 On 24 February 2006, Bodum informed Housewares of its instructions to surrender the designs, with or without agreement from Housewares. That communication was an open letter in respect of each design. The letters stated '[i] f [Housewares] is not willing to consent to the offer to surrender [the designs] , we propose to file a motion seeking the Federal Court of Australia's consent to the surrender and propose to seek costs if your client unreasonably rejects this offer '. It was not unreasonable for Housewares to insist that Bodum pay its costs to date as a condition for its consent. It did so by letter dated 1 March 2006. It was, however, unreasonable for Housewares to continue to incur costs on the cross-claim after being put on notice in an open letter that Bodum had instructed its solicitors to surrender the designs. This is especially so after 1 March 2006, when Bodum ' formally put [Housewares] on notice that it need not take any further steps in these proceedings relating to the [designs]'. Bodum should not be liable to pay the costs incurred by Housewares after the letters dated 24 February 2006.\\n\\n40 Bodum should pay Housewares' costs of its motion for the Court's consent to the surrender of the designs. Bodum should also pay Housewares' costs of the cross-claim for rectification of the Register of Designs incurred prior to the letters of 24 February 2006. Costs incurred by Housewares between 10 October 2005 and 28 November 2005 are payable on an indemnity basis. Costs are otherwise payable on a party and party basis. Each party is to bear its own costs in relation to the cross-claim for rectification after 24 February 2006. \\n\\n I certify that the preceding forty (40) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Bennett. \\n\\n\\n Associate:\\n\\nDated: 6 February 2007\\n\\n\\n Counsel for the Applicants: D K Catterns QC and S J Goddard \\n \\n Solicitor for the Applicants: Mallesons Stephen Jaques \\n \\n Counsel for the Respondent: W A Rothnie \\n \\n Solicitor for the Respondent: Arnold Bloch Leibler \\n \\n Date of Hearing: 2 May 2006 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 6 February 2007 \\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2007\\/44.html\"}}"
