As a result the applicants require leave to appeal before any appeal could be prosecuted in this Court: see s 24(1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). The notice of appeal filed on 11 July 2006, does not, in terms, constitute an application for leave. Any application for leave, now made, would be out of time: see O 52 r 5 of the Federal Court Rules . I note in this regard that the applicants are not legally represented and appear to have no appreciation of the interlocutory nature of the Federal Magistrates' decision or of the need to obtain leave to appeal from it. In other circumstances it might well have been appropriate to rule, that the notice of appeal should be treated, as incorporating an application for leave to appeal on the grounds therein contained. However, in this case nothing would, in my opinion, be gained by doing so. This is because the grounds being pursued by the applicants in this Court could not avail them at an appeal hearing. Moreover, leave would not be granted because the Federal Magistrates' decision is not attended with sufficient doubt to warrant it being reconsidered: Decor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc (1991) 33 FCR 397.\",\"1\":\"6 There can, in my view, be no doubt that the decision, which is the subject of this purported appeal, was interlocutory in nature: Han v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1426 at [10] and the cases therein cited.
