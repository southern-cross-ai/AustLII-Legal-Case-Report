I did not make that order because I was informed that an oral examination had taken place. I reserved the right of the receiver to apply for an order requiring a further oral examination.\\n\\n3 I reserved the question of costs. As directed each party has filed and served written submissions on what costs orders should be made. I have now considered those submissions.\"}}"
