Indeed, it is implicit in his approach to the application today that he accepts that the questions of law stated in the Notice of Appeal do not raise questions of law within the well known authorities of this Court. Those authorities include the decision in Birdseye v Australian Securities and Investment Commission [2003] FCAFC 232 ; (2003) 76 ALD 321 at 327. Stone J referred to the authorities at [16]ff in her decision to which I referred above.\\n\\n19 It is plain in my view that the questions of law do not comply with the principles stated in the authorities. They are simply not questions of law. Moreover, they are not even relevant to the issues raised before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The purported questions cavil with the issue of whether Mr Croker is eligible for the Disability Support Pension. They are not relevant to any issue which was raised before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.\",\"1\":\"16 Third, Mr Croker is well on notice of the fact that an appeal from the Administrative Appeals Tribunal must be on a question of law. On 27 June 2008 Stone J dismissed a proceeding brought by Mr Croker on that very ground: see Croker v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations [2008] FCA 971 ( Croker v Sec, Dept EEWR ).\\n\\n17 Fourth, Ms Watson informs me that there are a number of unsatisfied costs orders made against Mr Croker. One such order is an order that Mr Croker pay the costs of an unsuccessful application which was heard by Branson J. That decision is the matter which was referred to in [56] of the reasons for decision of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal (set out above). Also Ms Watson refers to an unsatisfied order for security for costs of an application for leave to appeal which Mr Croker has brought against the decision of Branson J. It appears that there are also other unsatisfied costs orders.\\n\\n21 In Croker v Sec, Dept EEWR [2008] FCA 971 , Stone J observed at [7] that these purposes are recognised in s 43(2B) of the Act, which provides that where the Tribunal is requested under s 43(2A) to give reasons, the reasons are to include the Tribunal's findings on material questions of fact and a reference to the evidence or other material on which those findings were based. Her Honour referred to a comparatively recent decision of Buchanan J in Jordan v Australian Postal Corporation (2007) 99 ALD 303 at 314 on this issue.\",\"2\":\"14 First, Ms Watson observed that the address given is not a proper address for service. Indeed, in Croker v Sydney Institute of TAFE (State of New South Wales) [2003] FCA 942 Bennett J found that this very address does not comply with the Rules of Court: see in particular [9] and [25] of her Honour's decision.\\n\\n15 Second, it seems to me to be plain that either the email was received by Mr Croker or, if not, he does not check his emails notwithstanding the fact that the email address appears in his purported address for service in the Notice of Appeal.\",\"3\":\"21 In Croker v Sec, Dept EEWR [2008] FCA 971 , Stone J observed at [7] that these purposes are recognised in s 43(2B) of the Act, which provides that where the Tribunal is requested under s 43(2A) to give reasons, the reasons are to include the Tribunal's findings on material questions of fact and a reference to the evidence or other material on which those findings were based. Her Honour referred to a comparatively recent decision of Buchanan J in Jordan v Australian Postal Corporation (2007) 99 ALD 303 at 314 on this issue.\",\"4\":\"20 Notwithstanding this, Mr Croker sought time to enable him to file an Amended Notice of Appeal raising two purported questions of law. The first question he seeks to raise is whether or not the delivery of the reasons by Senior Member Allen in the form of his judgment which incorporates a transcript can be said to be reasons for decision given in accordance with s 43(2) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth). In Martin v Australian Postal Corp [1999] FCA 655 ; (1999) 29 AAR 420 , Burchett J at 428 observed that the essence of the requirement that the Tribunal give reasons is that its decision must be understandable. His Honour referred to the purposes that are served by this rule.\"}}"
