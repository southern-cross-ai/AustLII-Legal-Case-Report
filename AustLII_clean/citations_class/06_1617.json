"{\"id\":{\"0\":\"c0\"},\"class\":{\"0\":\"cited\"},\"tocase\":{\"0\":\"Australian Securities and Investments Commission, In the Matter of Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd (ACN 099 071 968) v Carey (No 3) [2006] FCA 433\"},\"text\":{\"0\":\"1 On 20 April 2006 the Court made orders under s 1323 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) appointing receivers to the property of Westpoint Realty Pty Ltd (Westpoint Realty) and a number of other companies and individuals connected with the Westpoint Finance and Property Group (Westpoint Group): Australian Securities and Investments Commission, In the Matter of Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd (ACN 099 071 968) v Carey (No 3) [2006] FCA 433. The receivers appointed were Brian McMaster, Oren Zohar and Mark Korda. Orders were made at the same time requiring the authority of the receivers to approve transfers or dispositions of the property of the company to a value in excess of $5,000 within any seven day period.\\n\\n2 The orders made on 20 April 2006 were varied on 30 June 2006 by more elaborate orders. These included an order that, subject to the receivers' satisfaction as to the solvency of the company, they could approve payments by it to meet \\\"reasonable legal expenses\\\" incurred in these proceedings or in connection with proceedings brought against the company by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) or others in the future.\\n\\n3 The condition requiring satisfaction as to solvency before payments could be approved was modified by further orders made on 26 July 2006. By those orders the receivers were permitted to disregard, for the purposes of their satisfaction as to solvency, the potential liability of the company under guarantees it had given to so called Mezzanine companies in the Westpoint Group. The Mezzanine companies had raised funds from retail investors for property developments in the Westpoint Group. The receivers were also entitled to disregard the company's potential GST liability for the supply of sales and marketing services to other entities in the Westpoint Group. The modification of the condition requiring satisfaction as to solvency has been referred to in these proceedings as a \\\"carve-out\\\" from that condition.\"}}"
