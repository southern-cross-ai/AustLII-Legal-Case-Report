The effect of the authorities he referred to is that the requirements of the section are essentially formal.\\n\\n19 However, Hely J went on to say at [35] that the invitation must not be a hollow shell or an empty gesture. His Honour said at [36] that to invite the applicant to a hearing which she was unable to attend because of ill health would have been an empty gesture and a denial of procedural fairness. His Honour found at [39] that, in the particular circumstances of the case, the failure on the part of the RRT to postpone the applicant's hearing until a date on which she would be available to attend the hearing constituted denial of natural justice.\\n\\n20 It is clear from Hely J's reasons for judgment in NAHF that his Honour decided the matter upon the basis of a denial of procedural fairness rather than the content of the statutory obligation under s 425. Thus, it may be that the Full Court in SCAR misconstrued his Honour's decision; see NALQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 121 at [34] . However, it is not necessary for me to decide that question, even assuming that it is open to me to do so. Nor is it necessary for me to decide whether the effect of the authorities to which Hely J referred in NAHF establish that the requirements of s 425 are, as was contended by the appellant, substantive rather than formal.\\n\\n31 There was nothing in the facts of the present case to enliven an obligation of procedural fairness as was found by Hely J in NAHF . Nor can it be said that the invitation provided anything other than a real and meaningful opportunity to appear. The appellant declined the invitation to attend a hearing without providing any information to the RRT as to his reasons for doing so.\\n\\n32 The appellant submitted that there are widespread complaints about migration agents but there was nothing to point to any complaint about the appellant's own migration agent.\",\"3\":\"10 The learned magistrate observed that the appellant cannot complain that his actions, taken in reliance on advice received from the migration agent, led to his being denied procedural fairness: B41 of 2003 in the matter of an application for a writ of mandamus prohibition and certiorari v Refugee Review Tribunal (2004) FCA 30 (\\\" B41 \\\") at [25].\\n\\n11 The second ground in the application was that the RRT erred in failing to require the appellant to appear and give evidence, pursuant to s 427(3) of the Act . The appellant submitted that he made serious allegations of harm and the RRT should have made further enquiries before making its decision.\\n\\n22 In B41, Dowsett J referred at [23] to two Victorian decisions to the same effect; see SBA Foods Pty Limited v Victorian WorkCover Authority & Anor [2001] VSC 276 at [274] [283] per Gillard J; see also Stefanovski v County Court of Victoria & Anor [2000] VSC 417 at [175] [190] per Gillard J.\\n\\n24 Dowsett J's observations in B41 as to the approach to be taken in such matters is consistent with the remarks of Sundberg and Hely JJ in VNAA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 134 ; (2004) 136 FCR 407 (\\\" VNAA \\\") at [15] [16]. Their Honours there pointed out that the scheme of Part 7 of the Act expressly contemplates that in particular circumstances an applicant will not attend a hearing including cases involving no fault of the applicant. They said that, notwithstanding this, the RRT is authorised to proceed to decide the review in the applicant's absence.\\n\\n30 It seems to me therefore that, subject to the caveat expressed by Dowsett J in B41 as to the remarks of the Chief Justice in Hot Holdings, and the remarks of the Full Court in Barrett, the learned Federal Magistrate was correct in holding at [28] of her reasons that an appellant cannot complain that his actions, taken in reliance upon the advice received from his migration agent, led to his being denied procedural fairness.

His Honour observed that this does not mean that the decision maker must be personally at fault before there can be a denial of procedural fairness. He referred to the observation of Gleeson CJ in Hot Holdings.\\n\\n28 Indeed, in STKB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 546 at [19] , Selway J was of the view that Ex parte A does not reflect the law in Australia. His Honour considered that there may be some limited circumstances where it might be arguable that acts by Departmental officers or others could invalidate a Tribunal decision even though the Tribunal was unaware of them; see at [22] citing, inter alia, Hot Holdings at 455-456 per Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ.\\n\\n30 It seems to me therefore that, subject to the caveat expressed by Dowsett J in B41 as to the remarks of the Chief Justice in Hot Holdings, and the remarks of the Full Court in Barrett, the learned Federal Magistrate was correct in holding at [28] of her reasons that an appellant cannot complain that his actions, taken in reliance upon the advice received from his migration agent, led to his being denied procedural fairness.

He relied upon the oft quoted passage from the judgment of Mason J in Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550 at 585 that procedural fairness is a flexible concept which must be adapted to the circumstances of the particular case.\\n\\n34 However, in my opinion, the notice sent to the appellant on 10 November 2003 made it plain that the application would not be decided favourably to the appellant \\\"on the papers\\\".\",\"7\":\"12 Emmett FM noted that the RRT has power to summon a person to give evidence, but there is no obligation or duty to do so: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SGLB [2004] HCA 32 ; (2004) 207 ALR 12 (\\\" SGLB\\\") .\\n\\n13 The magistrate concluded that the RRT's decision was not affected by jurisdictional error and the application was dismissed.\\n\\n14 The notice of appeal filed on 26 September 2005 contains the same grounds as were pursued before the Federal Magistrate in the application for review.\\n\\n39 In SGLB at [43], Gummow and Hayne JJ held that, although s 427 of the Act confers power on the RRT to obtain a medical report, the Act does not impose any duty or obligation to do so.
