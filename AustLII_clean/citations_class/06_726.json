Under this provision a trade mark will be infringed where a mark which is \\\"substantially identical with, or deceptively similar to\\\" a registered trade mark is used in relation to the same goods as the registered goods. The use complained of must be \\\"use by the alleged infringer as a trade mark\\\" and this requires consideration of the \\\"purpose and nature of the impugned use\\\": see Shell Co of Australia Ltd v Esso Standard Oil (Australia) Ltd [1961] HCA 75 ; (1963) 109 CLR 407 at 426 per Kitto J as cited in Johnson & Johnson Australia Pty Ltd v Sterling Pharmaceuticals Pty Ltd (1991) 30 FCR 326 at 347 per Gummow J. It is clear that the respondents' use of the allegedly infringing marks is use for the purposes of trade.\\n\\n48 The third and fourth respondents have, in essence, admitted that they have infringed the Nokia Trade Marks. Nokia's evidence of the trap purchases from them and Mr Taylor's evidence that the goods were counterfeit made out Nokia's case of trade mark infringement against them. The third respondent has not attempted to file any defence in this proceeding and, in oral evidence, admitted that he had sold counterfeit Nokia products. In his \\\"Defence\\\" of 24 February 2006, the fourth respondent effectively admitted trade mark infringement. Accordingly, Nokia is entitled to summary judgment against the third and fourth respondents (Mr Akyildiz and Mr Kim).\\n\\n49 In contrast to the third and fourth respondents, the first and second respondents have denied trade make infringement. As counsel for Nokia noted, the affidavit and statements filed on their behalf did not include any firm denials stating that the alleged trap purchases had not taken place. Further, this material admitted that the first respondent had sold \\\"off market\\\" products and did not specifically deny that such products included unauthorised Nokia branded products. On their own, these vague and seemingly ambiguous denials would have no prospects of success at a trial.\",\"11\":\"57 There remains the question of whether leave should be given to the second respondent to represent the first respondent on the hearing of this motion. The general rule is that a company is not permitted to act by an officer but is required to act through a solicitor to defend proceedings against it: see O 9 r 1(3) of the Rules, which permits the Court to grant leave for someone other than a solicitor to defend the proceedings on the company's behalf. In Termi-Mesh Australia Pty Ltd v Josu Manufacturing Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1241 , French J considered the operation of this rule. His Honour noted, at [12], that, unlike the equivalent rule in other jurisdictions, there was no threshold requirement in O 9 r 1(3) of special or exceptional circumstances. The discretion conferred by the Rules of this Court is to be exercised by reference to all the relevant circumstances. However, as French J said at [13]:\\n \\n \\\"Nevertheless the policy of the rule is clear that ordinarily a corporation will be required to be represented by a solicitor. Relevant factors for dispensing with that requirement include the financial capacity or lack of capacity of the corporation and those standing behind it, the effect of diverting company resources to paying legal expenses, the nature of the company's undertaking, its financial structure, its ability to retain and pay its staff and the identity and spread of its shareholders.
