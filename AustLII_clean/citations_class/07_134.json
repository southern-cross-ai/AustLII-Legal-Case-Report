Further, in considering the second and third factors mentioned above, it may be necessary to have regard to the merits of the appeal. If the applicant has little or no prospect of success, then that would be a reason for refusing an extension. If, on the other hand, the appeal raises a matter of some importance or appears to have some prospect of success, that would be a reason absent any prejudice to the respondent for extending time.\\n\\n22 The judgment in this matter was given ex tempore. The applicant was present when judgment was delivered. He was aware on the date on which the order was made that his application for review had been dismissed. No evidence has been adduced as to when he changed his address or when the judgment was collected from the Federal Magistrates Court. Whilst the length of the delay is not great, the explanation for the delay is not satisfactory.\\n\\n23 The Minister can point to no prejudice if an extension of time were granted.\"}}"
