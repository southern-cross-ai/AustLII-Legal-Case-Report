Consistent with it being a hearing de novo, the appropriate form of order is to affirm the Registrar's orders: see Cottrell v Nicholls (as trustee in the estate of Cottrell) [2004] FCA 102 at [16] (per Allsop J) citing Meehan v Alfaro [1999] FCA 832 ; (1999) 93 FCR 201 at 212 and Martin v Commonwealth Bank of Australia (2001) 217 ALR 634 at [19].\",\"2\":\"40 Secondly, consistent with the decision of the Full Court in Guss v Johnstone [2000] FCA 1455 at [16] to [20] even if the trial judge's discretion miscarried (which it did not), the loss of any advantage to the appellant in the trial judge hearing the Petition, or her failure to adjourn the hearing of the Petition, did not amount to an injustice in the relevant sense. That there was no injustice is made clear from the terms on which the High Court dismissed the appellant's application for special leave to appeal: [2007] HCATrans 40 (8 February 2007). The disposition was in the following terms:\\n \\n \\n \\\"The respondent obtained a bankruptcy notice against the [appellant] on 23 September 2005. The [appellant] sought in the Federal Magistrates Court an order that a bankruptcy notice based on a taxation of costs be set aside. He argued that the costs in question had been paid by promissory note; that he had a valid cross-claim for an amount far in excess of the amount claimed in the bankruptcy notice; and that the issuing of the bankruptcy notice was an abuse of court process. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Phipps FM ruled that the promissory note did not constitute payment of the debt; there was no genuine prospect of success on the cross-claim; and no abuse of process had occurred. In the Federal Court, Sundberg J upheld the decision of Phipps FM, and dismissed the appeal. His Honour gave comprehensive reasons for judgment. Before this Court, the [appellant] seeks to challenge the validity of Sundberg J's exercise of appellate jurisdiction, and to press his contentions regarding the promissory note. \\n \\n The [appellant's] case before this Court discloses no error on the part of Sundberg J, and his contentions regarding jurisdiction are without substance. No question of law has been raised that would justify a grant of special leave. There would be no prospects of success on any appeal to this Court from the Federal Court, and consequently special leave is refused.\\\"\\n\\n41 This ground of appeal should be dismissed.\\n\\n42 Ground (f) is that \\\" Riley FM, by claiming jurisdiction and hearing the matter, was committing an Indictable Offense (sic).\\\"\",\"3\":\"60 An act of bankruptcy is committed at the end of the day on which a court determines that it is not satisfied of the matter referred to in s 41(7) of the Bankruptcy Act where:\\n \\n \\n (1) the bankruptcy notice had not otherwise been complied with within the requisite time. (The requirements involved either paying the debt or securing its payment to the satisfaction of the Court or the respondent or compounding the debt to the satisfaction of the respondent); and \\n (2) no extension of time had been sought or obtained under s 41(6A) of the Bankruptcy Act . \\n \\n \\n See Guss v Johnstone [2000] HCA 26 ; (2000) 74 ALJR 884 at [51] to [55].\\n\\n61 In the present case, Riley FM set out the law (at paras [23] and [24]) and concluded that (1) an act of bankruptcy was committed by the appellant on 31 October 2005 when Phipps FM dismissed the application to set aside the bankruptcy notice and (2) that \\\" act of bankruptcy was sufficient to found a valid creditor's petition \\\". There is no error.\\n\\n62 This ground of appeal should be dismissed.\\n\\n63 Grounds (l) to (r) concern ground of opposition 2 which was that \\\" I was within the time prescribed by the rules to appeal the decision upon which the petition was based \\\".\\n\\n64 This ground of appeal raises the same or substantially the same matters as grounds (e) and (k). It should be dismissed on the same bases.\",\"4\":\"31 Secondly, the fact that the Registrar granted leave for the Petition to be amended was consistent with s 33(1)(b) of the Bankruptcy Act . In MacDonald v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy [2001] FCA 140 ; (2001) 107 FCR 72 at [25] , the Full Court stated:\\n \\n \\n \\\"There is extensive authority for the proposition that the power of amendment in s 33(1)(b) extends to authorising the amendment of petitions to cure omissions of allegations made mandatory by the various provisions of the Bankruptcy Act and Bankruptcy Rules, that is, to cure what can be accepted to be more serious deficiencies in petitions than \\\"formal defects or irregularities\\\" within s 306.\\\"\\n\\n32 The date of the commission of the act of bankruptcy is an allegation made mandatory in a petition: s 47(1A) of the Bankruptcy Act and Form 150 in Sch 1 to the Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth). The discretion to amend in s 33(1)(b) is exercisable in all cases according to the circumstances of the particular case: MacDonald v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy [2001] FCA 140 ; (2001) 107 FCR 72 at [24] . In the present case, the appellant could not have been left in any doubt by what was stated in the Petition - the appellant had committed an act of bankruptcy within six months before presentation of the Petition by failing to comply with a bankruptcy notice dated 23 September 2005 (personally served on him on 29 September 2005), by failing to pay or secure the amount specified in the bankruptcy notice or by failing to satisfy the court that there was a valid ground for dismissing the notice: MacDonald v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy [2001] FCA 140 ; (2001) 107 FCR 72 at 82. Unsurprisingly, the appellant did not suggest that he was left in any doubt that he had committed an act of bankruptcy and the Petition had been issued on that basis.\\n\\n33 This ground of appeal should be dismissed.\\n\\n34 Ground (c) is that \\\" [a]s a hearing De novo, Riley FM failed to rule that re-verification and re-service be dispensed with .\\\" This ground of appeal substantially overlaps with ground (b) and should be dismissed on those bases.\",\"5\":\"24 This ground of appeal proceeds upon a misunderstanding of the nature of the review provided for in s 104(2) of the FM Act .

Consistent with it being a hearing de novo, the appropriate form of order is to affirm the Registrar's orders: see Cottrell v Nicholls (as trustee in the estate of Cottrell) [2004] FCA 102 at [16] (per Allsop J) citing Meehan v Alfaro [1999] FCA 832 ; (1999) 93 FCR 201 at 212 and Martin v Commonwealth Bank of Australia (2001) 217 ALR 634 at [19].\",\"6\":\"24 This ground of appeal proceeds upon a misunderstanding of the nature of the review provided for in s 104(2) of the FM Act .

On 31 October 2005, Phipps FM heard the application and dismissed it. His Honour's reasons for decision are to be found in Moran v Lydiard Financial Services Pty Ltd [2005] FMCA 1821.\\n\\n8 On 10 November 2005, a creditor's petition was presented against the appellant (\\\"the Petition\\\"). On 26 November 2005, the appellant was served with the Petition and associated documents. On 28 November 2005, Ms Elliot swore another affidavit deposing to service of the Petition and associated documents on the appellant. In this affidavit, Ms Elliot deposed that at the time of service, she asked the person served the same questions that she had asked on 29 September 2005 when she served the Bankruptcy Notice and received the same answers. The Petition was returnable on 24 January 2006. The hearing of the Petition was adjourned by consent to a date to be fixed after determination of the appeal against the decision of Phipps FM was heard by Sundberg J, on the giving of five days notice in writing by either party.\",\"8\":\"13 On 4 July 2006, the appellant filed an application for review against the Sequestration Order (\\\"the Review Application\\\"). The Review Application was heard by Riley FM on 28 August and 8 September 2006. On 19 October 2006, Riley FM dismissed the Review Application. Her Honour's reasons for decision are to be found in Moran v Lydiard Financial Services Pty Ltd (previously Cuthberts Nominees Pty Ltd) [2006] FMCA 1341. After setting out the affidavit material filed in support of the Petition, Riley FM described the course the Review Application took before her in the following terms:\\n \\n \\\"11. The present application for review was filed on 4 July 2006 and was supported with an affidavit affirmed by Mr Moran on that date, a further affidavit affirmed by Mr Moran on 31 July 2006 and a notice of the grounds of opposition to the petition dated 31 July 2006. When the application for review was being heard, Mr Moran indicated that he had mistakenly understood that an affidavit that he had filed in relation to his application to set aside the bankruptcy notice was before the court. He was given leave to file in this proceeding an affidavit dealing with the material that he had understood was already before the court, as well as material indicating that he was a beneficiary of his mother's estate. That material was included in an affidavit affirmed by Mr Moran on 30 August 2006. \\n \\n 12. Mr Moran also handed up late in the hearing a photocopy of an order of the District Court of Queensland dated 1 December 1995 which provided that a debt of $80,000 owing to Mr Moran's uncle's estate by Mr Moran's mother (\\\"Mrs Moran\\\") be transferred to Mr Moran, Mrs Moran and two other relatives in equal shares. The provenance of that document was not established before this court. [Nor] was any evidence given about whether the debt mentioned in the order had been discharged in the 10 years or so since the order was apparently made. Mr Moran did not satisfactorily explain how the order had a bearing on the present review. Accordingly, I am unable to take it into account.\\\"\\n\\n14 On 8 November 2006, the appellant filed this appeal against the orders made by Riley FM dismissing the Review Application.\\n\\n15 Finally, on 8 February 2007, the High Court dismissed the appellant's application for special leave to appeal from the orders made by Sundberg J on 26 May 2006.\",\"9\":\"9 On 21 November 2005, the appellant served a notice of appeal in respect of the decision of Phipps FM. The appeal against the decision of Phipps FM was heard by Sundberg J on 28 April 2006. On 26 May 2006, Sundberg J dismissed the appeal. His Honour's reasons for decision are to be found in Moran v Lydiard Financial Services Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 631.\\n\\n10 On 14 June 2006, Ms Elliot swore another affidavit in relation to service of the Bankruptcy Notice on the appellant. Significantly, Ms Elliot deposed that she knew that the person she served with the Bankruptcy Notice on 29 September 2005 was the appellant because she had previously served that person with other court documents and he had identified himself as John Gerard Moran.\\n\\n11 The Petition was ultimately heard by Registrar Agnew on 15 June 2006. The appellant did not attend. Registrar Agnew made the following orders:\\n \\n \\n \\\"1. Leave be granted to amend paragraph 4 of the petition to substitute 31 October 2005 for 20 October 2005 as the date of commission of the act of bankruptcy. \\n \\n \\n \\n 2.
