Nor are they \\\"directly relevant\\\" to the proceeding: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Advanced Medical Institute Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 366 at [21] [23] per Lindgren J.\\n\\nThe issues in this proceeding are different from those in the Cadbury proceeding. Such overlap as does exist is not sufficient to warrant the orders.\\n\\nTo the extent that the documents are sought on the issue of damages, I do not consider they are relevant or necessary. As was submitted by the respondents, any relevant documents are already covered by existing orders so that what is really sought is nothing more than the right to \\\"fish\\\" for further material.\",\"1\":\"The background to the claim for the first six categories is to be found in two judgments of Tamberlin J, Jarra Creek Central Packaging Shed Pty Ltd v Amcor Ltd [2007] FCA 1559 ; Jarra Creek Central Packaging Shed Pty Ltd v Amcor Limited [2009] FCA 60.

There was some criticism by counsel for the Amcor and Visy respondents of the nature of Professor Rubinfeld's evidence. However, I am satisfied that it does demonstrate that the discovery of data for a wider period than that ordered by Tamberlin J is \\\"necessary in the interests of a fair trial\\\": Trade Practices Commission v CC (New South Wales) Pty Limited (No 4) (1995) 58 FCR 426 at 436 per Lindgren J.\\n\\nThe \\\"clean period\\\" data which is sought places some emphasis on the post-cartel period. This is because of the inadequacy of the pre-cartel data discovered to date. Although Professor Rubinfeld accepts that it is preferable to analyse data for the period prior to the formation of the cartel, he says that in the absence of such data, post-cartel material takes on an even greater importance.\\n\\nAlthough some post-cartel material, namely from November 2004 to May 2006 has already been produced, Professor Rubinfeld says that this is \\\"highly unlikely\\\" to be sufficient. I accept this evidence and the reasons given for it, including the difficulties associated with the lingering effects of cartel behaviour.\"}}"
