The applicant relies upon the decision of Sundberg J in Rio Tinto Ltd v Federal Commission of Taxation [2004] FCA 335 ; (2004) 55 ATR 321 particularly at [31] and [58] that underlines the importance of the appeal statement and the necessity for it to fully state the basis of the relevant decision, and refers to Clark v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 1426 at [37] .

In order to succeed the Court must be satisfied that the Commissioner has no reasonable prospect of successfully defending the proceeding (s 31A(1)(b) Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth)), although a defence need not be hopeless or bound to fail for it to have no reasonable prospect of success (s 31A(3)).
