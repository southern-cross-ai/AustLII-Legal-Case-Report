There was considerable debate before me as to this question. In light of the view I have come to on other issues, it is unnecessary for me to come to a final view on this question. My own tentative view is that the correct contention is that the issue of the Promissory Notes did not form part of a managed investment scheme. The arguments not accepted by Simmonds J in Australian Securities & Investments Commission v Emu Brewery Mezzanine Ltd [2004] WASC 241 seem to have considerable force.\\n\\nIt seems to me that all that is involved here is the issue of promissory notes by a corporation with particular credit worthy characteristics and with a particular financing structure, which included the provision of certain securities for the lending of monies to investors. Each investor was offered and accepted a promissory note. All that was offered and acquired was the entitlement to payment of interest and repayment of capital in accordance with the promissory note, and no more or less. This is not the acquiring of rights to benefits produced by any 'scheme'.\\n\\nAs I have said, I do not find it necessary to go further into this matter it would involve an analysis of the decision in Emu Brewery Mezzanine WASC 241, and possibly, the decisions of Finkelstein J in Financial Industry Complaints Service Ltd v Deakin Financial Services Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1805 ; (2006) 157 FCR 229 and Re York Street Mezzanine Pty Ltd (in liq) [2007] FCA 922 ; (2007) 162 FCR 358 , and the question of the extent to which I should follow those decisions even if I considered any of them to be error. Characterisation of Representations\",\"1\":\"It is important to analyse the conduct and statements of PIR as a whole, taking into account disclaimers and other circumstances showing the true character of the conduct and statements themselves: see eg Campbell (2009) HCA 25 at [130] and Butcher v Lachlan Elder Realty Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 60 ; (2004) 218 CLR 592.\",\"2\":\"Further, a disclaimer was included in the PIR reports.
