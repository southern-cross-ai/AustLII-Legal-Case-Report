Similar arguments to those put in this case were put to the Full Court of this Court in Djalic v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 151 ; (2004) 139 FCR 292. The Court considered the authorities relevant to the relationship between laws providing for the deportation of aliens and the cancellation of their visas and Chapter 111 of the Constitution and then summarised the effect of those authorities in the following propositions (at [66]):\\n \\n \\n '1. Section 51(xix) of the Constitution empowers Parliament to make a law providing for the deportation of aliens for whatever reason Parliament thinks fit, unless the Constitution otherwise prohibits the making of the law. \\n 2. Under Chapter III of the Constitution , the adjudication and punishment of criminal guilt by reason of an alleged breach of a law of the Commonwealth appertains to the judicial power of the Commonwealth and cannot be entrusted to the Executive. If, therefore, Commonwealth legislation on its proper construction, purports to authorise the Executive to impose punishment for criminal conduct, the legislation, to that extent, will infringe Chapter III of the Constitution . \\n 3. Whether legislation conferring power to cancel the visa or order the deportation of a non-citizen is punitive in character is to be determined by construction of the legislation, not by a consideration of the consequences of detention or removal of the individual. \\n 4. Accordingly, the power to cancel a visa or order the deportation of a non-citizen is not to be regarded as punitive in character merely because exercise of the power involves interference with the liberty of the individual or imposes what the individual may see as sanctions consequential on his criminal connections. Neither can detention incidental to deportation of a non-citizen be characterised as punitive merely because it involves deprivation of liberty. \\n 5. Legislation conferring a discretion on the Executive to cancel the visa of a non-citizen or to deport a non-citizen is not characterised as punitive if it can fairly be said to protect the Australian community. This is so even where the pre-condition that must be satisfied for the exercise of the power is the conviction of the non-citizen for a criminal offence or the imposition of a minimum period of imprisonment. \\n 6. Nonetheless, if in a particular case the decision-maker purports to exercise a statutory power to cancel the visa of a non-citizen or to deport the non-citizen or order to punish the non-citizen and not for protection of the Australian community or some other legitimate objective, the exercise of the power may be ultra vires the statute.'\",\"1\":\"18 Whether a person has been absorbed into the Australian community and thereby ceased to be an immigrant requires a consideration of a number of the factual matters of which French J provided a summary in Johnson v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 137 ; (2004) 136 FCR 494 at 510 [46] .\\n\\n19 It seems to me that it is likely the applicant fell within the terms of s 34 of the Act and I am prepared to assume that he held an absorbed person visa on 1 September 1994.\\n\\n20 The applicant submits that he could only hold one visa at a time and therefore he did not also hold a transitional permanent visa on 1 September 1994. He referred to s 82(2) of the Act which is in the following terms:\\n \\n \\n '(2) A substantive visa held by a non-citizen ceases to be in effect if another substantive visa (other than a special purpose visa) for the non-citizen comes into effect.'\",\"2\":\"14 At the time this appeal was argued before me, the High Court had not handed down its decision in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Nystrom . That decision has now been handed down: [2006] HCA 50 ; (2006) 81 ALJR 1 (' Nystrom '). The decision is a significant one in that it resolves a number of the issues in this case.\\n\\n15 In Nystrom , the Minister appealed from a decision of the Full Court of this Court. The Minister had cancelled the respondent's transitional permanent visa and the respondent challenged that decision. He submitted that he held an absorbed person visa instead of, or in addition to, the transitional permanent visa. He submitted that the Minister's decision was invalid for jurisdictional error because the Minister had made a decision in relation to a visa he did not hold. He also argued that if he held a transitional permanent visa the Minister in cancelling that visa had erred because he had not taken into account the fact that by reason of s 501F(3) of the Act his decision would also lead to the cancellation of his absorbed person visa. The respondent also submitted that the power in s 501(2) was restricted or curtailed by the operation of s 200 and s 201 of the Act. It will be apparent from this brief summary that a number of the arguments in Nystrom were the same as the arguments put in this case.\\n\\n16 By the time Nystrom had reached the High Court it was common ground that on 1 September 1994 the respondent held an absorbed person visa. As I have said, in the case before me the Tribunal member seems to have assumed that the applicant held an absorbed person visa, although he did not finally decide the point. On appeal to this Court, the Minister argued the matter on the basis that the applicant held an absorbed person visa as at 1 September 1994 without conceding that that was necessarily the case.\\n\\n17 A non-citizen who falls within the terms of s 34(2) of the Act is taken to have been granted an absorbed person visa on 1 September 1994. Section 34(1) and (2) of the Act are in the following terms:\\n \\n \\n '(1) There is a class of permanent visas to remain in, but not re-enter, Australia, to be known as absorbed person visas. \\n \\n \\n (2) A non-citizen in the migration zone who: \\n \\n \\n (a) on 2 April 1984 was in Australia; and \\n (b) before that date, had ceased to be an immigrant; and \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n (c) on or after that date, has not left Australia, where left Australia has the meaning it had in this Act before 1 September 1994; and \\n (d) immediately before 1 September 1994, was not a person to whom section 20 of this Act as in force then applied; \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n is taken to have been granted an absorbed person visa on 1 September 1994.'\",\"3\":\"29 The facts in this case are different from the facts in Nystrom but the conclusion is the same. The Tribunal member said that the delegate's decision was probably invalid because the delegate failed to take into consideration that the cancellation of the applicant's transitional permanent visa also led to the cancellation of his absorbed person visa. In reaching that conclusion the Tribunal member followed the reasoning of the majority of the Full Court of this Court in Nystrom v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 121 ; (2005) 143 FCR 420. In view of the High Court's decision in Nystrom that conclusion is wrong. The Tribunal member then said that he could not review the decision of the delegate which had the effect of cancelling the applicant's absorbed person visa because no application to review that 'decision' had been made by the applicant. I do not think this observation advances the matter because, as the Minister submitted, there probably was no right of review in relation to that 'decision'. Section 500 of the Act provides that there is a right of review only from the decision of the delegate under s 501. The Tribunal member went on to say that a right of review in relation to the deemed cancellation of the absorbed person visa would be of no practical utility because s 501F(3) operates to cancel that visa upon cancellation of the transitional permanent visa. I do not think I need to comment further on this reasoning because, on the reasoning of the High Court in Nystrom , the Tribunal member would not have erred if he had not taken into account the deemed cancellation of the absorbed person visa. As it happens the Tribunal member did take that into account. At the conclusion of his reasons, he said:\\n \\n 'After considering all the evidence before me and balancing all of the relevant considerations in the Direction, I have decided that it is appropriate to exercise the discretion under s 501(2) of the Act in favour of cancelling the applicant's transitional (permanent) visa Class BF. \\n I must also take into account that by virtue of s 501F(3) of the Act, the cancellation of Mr Pull's transitional (permanent) visa class BF involves a deemed decision to cancel his absorbed person visa (assuming, as I have, that he is the holder of such a visa). I find that on the facts of this matter, the considerations referred to in the Direction in relation to the exercise of discretion to cancel the absorbed person visa lead to the same issues and the same conclusions. The consequential cancellation of that visa does not therefore lead me to reach a different conclusion in reviewing the delegate's decision.'\\n\\n30 In conclusion, at the time the Tribunal member made his decision the applicant held both a transitional permanent visa and an absorbed person visa and his submission to the contrary must be rejected. In deciding that the transitional permanent visa should be cancelled the Tribunal member would not have erred if he had not taken into account the fact that would also lead to the cancellation of the absorbed person visa. As it happens, he did take that into account. The fact that there are aspects of the Tribunal member's reasons with which I do not agree does not affect those conclusions. The applicant's first submission must be rejected.\",\"4\":\"34 The applicant's third submission is that s 501(2) authorises an impermissible exercise of judicial power in that it authorises the Minister to punish a visa-holder for the crimes he or she has committed and for which he or she has already been punished. To the extent that it does that it is said by the applicant to be invalid. The applicant refers to observations made by Spender J in Shaw v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 106 ; (2005) 142 FCR 402 at [30] - [35] . In the alternative, the applicant submits that if s 501(2) does not authorise an impermissible exercise of the judicial power and is valid, nevertheless, in this case, the power was exercised for the impermissible purpose of punishing the applicant for the criminal offences he had committed. In the context of this submission the applicant referred to the following factual matters:\\n \\n 1. The applicant is a non-citizen of longstanding, which I assume means that he has been in Australia for a considerable period of time.\\n 2. The applicant has two children in Australia.\\n 3. The applicant was the holder of an absorbed person's visa and was entitled to rely upon the nature of the visa, coupled with the protective elements of s 201 of the Act, to assume that he had been absorbed in the Australian community.\\n 4. The applicant has no significant ties with his place of birth and would be liable to live a destitute life.\\n 5. The applicant has been punished by the Australian courts for offences committed in Australia while present here as an absorbed person.\",\"5\":\"35 In Shaw v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 72 ; (2003) 218 CLR 28 the High Court held that s 501(2) is a valid exercise of the Federal Parliament's power to make laws with respect to aliens. Similar arguments to those put in this case were put to the Full Court of this Court in Djalic v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 151 ; (2004) 139 FCR 292.
