Thus, the Court must be satisfied on the material before it that the act was in truth inadvertent.\\n\\n40 In the present case, inadvertence is established by the fact that even when cross-examined on the documents, Mr Leong did not realise that the documents in Exhibit \\nJL1 included the Extra Documents.\\n\\n41 It was only when Mr Heath realised what had happened that he drew his Honour's attention to the apparent inadvertence. This is clear, in my view from the passages of the transcript that I have reproduced above.\\n\\n42 It is true that in the last passage of the transcript that I have reproduced at [27], Mr Heath said that no issue of inadvertence arose. However, this was because, as Mr Heath correctly observed, the amended application before his Honour dealt only with the question of whether privilege could be maintained over Exhibit SDP6.\\n\\n43 With due respect to his Honour, whose judgment was given ex tempore , an examination of the transcript shows that Mr Heath did not eschew inadvertence in relation to the maintenance of the claim over the Extra Documents.\\n\\n44 Of course, I do not criticise his Honour for delivering ex tempore reasons. It is merely that a full reading of the transcript puts in context the last passage of Counsel's remarks on the issue of inadvertence.\\n\\n45 In any event, I would add that it is difficult to see how the tender of Exhibit JL1 was inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality. It was tendered on an application to claim privilege and it was tendered with the express proviso in [50] of Mr Leong's statement that he did not intend to disclose confidential communications to which privilege may attach.\",\"3\":\"36 Reference may also be made to the observations, to the same effect, by Gyles J in Bennett v Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Customs Service [2004] FCAFC 237 ; (2004) 140 FCR 101 at [68] .

Mr Boensch submits that, upon the proper application of the principle stated by the High Court in Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1999) 201 CLR 1 at 13, there was no implied or accidental waiver of privilege in the six documents.\\n\\n4 The essential reason why this issue arises is the failure of the solicitor who produced the documents to the first respondent, Mr Pascoe, and to the Court, to make proper enquiry as to the extent of the materials comprised within the documents that were produced and tendered.\\n\\n5 In the hope of maintaining clarity in my analysis of the question, I will endeavour to distinguish between the documents produced or referred to at various stages of the proceeding.\\n\\n34 The test of implied waiver of privilege was stated by the High Court in Mann v Carnell at [29]. Their Honours pointed to an intentional act of disclosure which was inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality in the communication.\\n\\n35 Their Honours went on to say that \\\"[w]hat brings about the waiver is the inconsistency, which the courts, where necessary informed by considerations of fairness, perceive, between the conduct of the client and maintenance of confidentiality\\\". They said the test is \\\"not some overriding principle of fairness operating at large\\\".\\n\\n37 It is unnecessary for present purposes to determine whether or to what extent the provisions of s 122 of the Evidence Act dealing with the circumstances in which privilege may be lost correspond with the common law principles; see Mann v Carnell at [23]; see also Van Zonneveld v Seaton [2004] NSWSC 960 at [11] (per Campbell J).\",\"5\":\"37 It is unnecessary for present purposes to determine whether or to what extent the provisions of s 122 of the Evidence Act dealing with the circumstances in which privilege may be lost correspond with the common law principles; see Mann v Carnell at [23]; see also Van Zonneveld v Seaton [2004] NSWSC 960 at [11] (per Campbell J).\"}}"
