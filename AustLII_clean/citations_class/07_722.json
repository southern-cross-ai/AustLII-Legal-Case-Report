To assist this task of construction various tests have been suggested, which if applicable to the case under consideration may prove helpful, or even conclusive.

The shareholders agreement also contemplated that the respondents had to achieve the performance criteria themselves so as to be entitled to the issue of the shares under that agreement. In my opinion, regard can be had to those two previous transactions to discern the objective intention of the parties in relation to the circular resolution: HIH Casualty & General Insurance Ltd v New Hampshire Insurance Company [2001] 2 Lloyd's Report 161 at [83].\\n\\n388 The very purpose of performance shares, in my opinion, is to induce the person to whom the shares are given to perform. That was the purpose for their issue in this case because it was important for the applicant to have those who had the responsibility of managing the applicant achieve the performance criteria. The performance shares were issued with the objective intention that the performance criteria in the performance shares would be met by the holders of the performance shares themselves. That means that the respondents had to cause the applicant to achieve the performance milestones.\\n\\n389 It was contended by the applicant that the respondents had to raise capital with ANZIS in accordance with ANZIS' offer of 29 November 2004 because that transaction was later embodied in the subscription agreement. Because that particular capital raising did not occur, then that criteria was not achieved. I do not think that the circular resolution necessarily obliged the respondents to raise capital only in accordance with ANZIS' offer of 29 November 2004. I think the criterion that needed to be met was to raise sufficient capital so as to allow the second criterion also to be met. It did not need to be with ANZIS or, if it was with ANZIS, it did not need to be only in the terms of the offer made on 29 November 2004. It was only necessary that the respondents raised sufficient capital to allow the second criterion to be met. In any event, that does not weaken the applicant's case because, whatever the criterion was, it was not met by either or both the respondents.\\n\\n390 In my opinion, the first respondent is not entitled to claim that the performance shares converted to B Class shares after the applicant satisfied the performance criteria in the circular resolution under its new management.\\n\\n391 It follows that if I am wrong about my conclusion that the resolution contained in the circular resolution should be rescinded and the issue of the performance shares set aside and the first respondent is entitled to the performance shares, the first respondent will never be entitled to have those shares convert to B Class shares because he and the second respondent did not satisfy the performance criteria.\",\"8\":\"365 An application under s 1322(4)(a) is not confined to a procedural irregularity.

It must also be exercised having regard to the interests of all parties affected and the public interest in ensuring compliance with statute law and company constitutions.

For the reasons already given, that particular has not been made out. The performance shares in the circular resolution were to issue on more favourable terms to the respondents than the performance shares contemplated in the shareholders agreement.\\n\\n372 The applicant pleaded in reply to the first respondent's defence that the failure to comply with s 246B of the Corporations Act has resulted in substantial injustice in that the applicant's shareholders would have or may have refused to approve the issue of the performance shares.
