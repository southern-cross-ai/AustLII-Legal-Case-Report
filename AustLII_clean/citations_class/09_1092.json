In Cahill v Construction, Forestry Mining and Energy Union (No 2) [2008] FCA 1292 ; (2008) 170 FCR 357 at [49] - [57] , Kenny J held that the words \\\"a ban, limitation or restriction on the performance of building work\\\" in paras (b) and (c) of the definition of \\\"building industrial action\\\" in the BCII Act covered the imposition of bans, limitations or restrictions by unions. Arguably s 38 extends to union officers in a case such as this. In any event the interlocutory injunction as against the CFMEU would, practically, be directed also at its employees, officers or agents.\\n\\nFurther or alternatively, Mr McDonald and Mr Buchan and the CFMEU, are amenable to interlocutory injunctive orders under s 49 of the BCII Act by reason of the accessorial liability provisions of s 48(2) if a prima facie case is demonstrated that each aided, abetted, counselled or procured the contraventions by employees; or in the case of Mr McDonald and Mr Buchan that they were also directly or indirectly knowingly concerned in or a party to those contraventions.\\n\\nIt will be sufficient for present purposes in relation to Mr McDonald and Mr Buchan, as respondents, if in due course, I consider only the question of accessorial liability under s 48, which of course depends on primary liability, upon a prima facie basis, being established against the CFMEU.\",\"7\":\"Section 39(3) is in the same terms as s 80(4) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth). In ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1992] FCA 474 ; (1992) 38 FCR 248 Lockhart J (with whom French J agreed) said at 256-7: \\n \\n Subsections (4) and (5) of s 80 are novel because they empower the court to grant injunctive relief notwithstanding that the defendant has not previously engaged in the prohibited conduct or does not intend to engage in it again or to continue to engage in it or there is no imminent danger of substantial damage. Yet these are the traditional requirements for equitable injunctive relief.\\n . . .\\n In my opinion subss (4) and (5) are designed to ensure that once the condition precedent to the exercise of injunctive relief has been satisfied (ie contraventions or proposed contraventions of Pts IV or V of the Act), the court should be given the widest possible injunctive powers, devoid of traditional constraints, though the power must be exercised judicially and sensibly. \\n . . .\\n This does not mean that the traditional equitable doctrines are irrelevant. For example, it must be relevant to consider questions of repetition of conduct or whether it has ever occurred before or whether imminent substantial damage is likely: but the absence of any one or more of these elements is not fatal to the grant of an injunction under s 80. That is the effect of subss (4) and (5) (subs (4) in relation to the prevention of conduct and subs (5) in relation to a mandatory injunction). Their presence is not an indication of a new statutory house, rather an old house with some modern extensions. \\n \\n\\n \\nGummow J at 267 came to essentially the same conclusion.\\n Section 49 BCII Act\\n\\nSection 49(1)(c) and (3) of the BCII Act empower the Court to grant injunctions (including interim injunctions) in relation to a person who has contravened a civil penalty provision. Subsection 49(6) defines an eligible person to make an application under s 49(1) and (3) to include the ABCC. Thus, s 49(1) and s 49(3)(a) empower this Court on the present application, to make an interim injunction in relation to a person who has contravened s 38.\\n\\nThis Court may grant injunctive relief under s 39 and its power to do so may, under s 39(3)(a), be exercised whether or not it appears that the respondents intend to engage again in the relevant conduct. The question of repetition is nonetheless of relevance to the exercise of the discretion, but the relevance is set in the particular context of public interest injunctions, as distinct from those related to private proprietary interests: ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1992] FCA 474 ; (1992) 38 FCR 248 at 256\\/7 per Lockhart J; 267 per Gummow J; 268 per French J. The Court is inclined to grant an injunction in cases of statutory injunctions in the public interest where there has been unlawful conduct, in order to add contempt to the disincentives for repetition: per French J at 268 where his Honour said: \\n \\n There is room ... for an injunction that is intended not to restrain an apprehended repetition of contravening conduct but to deter an offender from repeating the offence. That deterrence is effected by attaching to the repetition of the contravention the range of sanctions available for contempt of court.\\n\\nIn this case, a prima facie case has been established of contraventions which have already occurred twice over a combined period of 4 days.

There was no requirement for the concern for health and safety to be an imminent risk. Nonetheless his Honour considered the concepts of \\\"imminence\\\", \\\"seriousness\\\", \\\"proportionality\\\" and \\\"justification\\\" which would be relevant to the exercise of the Court's discretion: \\n \\n (a) Whether it is a \\\"reasonable\\\" concern involves an objective assessment of the nature of that concern; \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n (b) A concern may be reasonable so long as it is not fanciful, illogical or irrational at the time the concern arises, without the benefit of hindsight and the knowledge of whether a real risk does in fact exist; \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n (c) There is no need to establish that an actual risk existed at the time; \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n (d) The reasonableness must be assessed from the perspective of an ordinary and reasonable person in the position of the employees involved at the relevant time; \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n (e) The reasonable concern must continue during all times that the relevant industrial action is occurring; and \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n (f) Previous incidents, occurrences or beliefs may be relevant to a basis for a concern for health or safety in the circumstances.\\n\\nAccordingly the issue is not whether certain matters did in fact constitute a risk to health or safety, but rather whether any employee reasonably held a concern about an imminent risk to their health or safety.\\n\\nThe applicant accepts, correctly in my view, that an employee may have a concern even though his or her concern arose only from something communicated by a union official.
