In the case of a court appointed receiver and manager, Street J in Duffy v Super Centre Development Corporation Ltd [1967] 1 NSWR 382 said (at 383): \\n \\n 'The receiver and manager is appointed as an officer of the Court to undertake in that capacity the management of the business of the company as well, of course, as undertaking the care of the company's assets. To the extent to which he makes decisions from time to time, they are in effect made under the authority of the Court itself, and they are subject to review and control by the Court should a proper case be made out requiring such intervention. Whilst this Court does, therefore, have an ultimate control over the day-to-day actions of a receiver and manager, it is a control which is not in my view to be too freely exercised. If, of course, there can be shown to be some defect in the manner in which the receiver and manager is conducting his duties a defect arising out of some want of good faith or out of some erroneous approach in law or in principle then that is clearly a ground on which the Court would entertain an application by one of the interested parties for appropriate directions or some other form of remedial order. Where, however, the challenge made is that there has been an absence of prudence and wisdom in the receiver's decisions, a far heavier onus rests upon the party who seeks to challenge the decision in question. The Court will not concern itself with minor and ordinary decisions that he may have made: it must be shown that there is a decision of real significance in the affairs of the company and as to which there are real and substantial grounds for questioning its correctness before the Court will embark upon an investigation of what, if any, directions ought to be given.' \\n \\n\\nThose observations were repeated by his Honour in Re Mineral Securities Australia Ltd (In Liq) [1973] 2 NSWLR 207 at 231, a case involving a challenge to a decision of a liquidator.

That section is one which enables appeals to the court to be made in relation to manner of acts, omissions or decisions of a liquidator. The role which the court takes on the appeal is affected significantly by the nature of the act, omission or decision which is being appealed against. Where the appeal is against a discretionary decision by a liquidator, or against a decision involving matters of business judgment, the court will reverse the liquidator's decision only when it is satisfied that he was acting unreasonably or in bad faith.' \\n \\n\\nHis Honour went on at [47] to distinguish the approach taken on an appeal from a liquidator's rejection of a proof of debt, a distinction which I respectfully accept.\\n\\n45 I would not set the threshold required under s 1321 in respect of the discretionary decisions of private receivers and managers so high that it is necessary to show that there has been something akin to unreasonableness in the sense necessary to vitiate the exercise of a statutory power under administrative law. It is sufficient to say that at the very least the person bringing an appeal under s 1321 in these circumstances must demonstrate that the decision is informed by some error of law or significant factual error or is otherwise so unreasonable, in the circumstances, that it should not be allowed to stand. The content of those somewhat ambulatory considerations will be informed by the significance of the decision to the affairs of the company.\\n\\n46 In the present case, having regard to the obligations of the receivers and managers under the Charge, the limited cash, in their judgment, available to the company, its liability to the mortgagee and the potential claims of other creditors, I see no basis upon which the receivers and managers' refusal to make available funding for the purpose of defending winding up proceedings should be interfered with. The company has charged all of its assets in favour of the mortgagee. In so doing it has disabled itself, following the appointment of the receivers and managers, from having access to those assets for other purposes. Mr Carey's arguments about the financial position of the company do not establish a basis for gainsaying the judgment of the receivers and managers.\\n\\n47 Whether or not after protracted proceedings it might be shown that the receivers and managers' evaluation was erroneous and that of Mr Carey correct, is not a possibility that can form a basis for interfering with the decision.\\n\\n48 The amount required is small. It may be that if Mr Carey wishes to defend the proceedings in the name of the company it can be obtained from some other source. I decline to interfere with the decision of the receivers and managers in this case. \\n I certify that the preceding forty-eight (48) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice French. \\n\\n\\n Associate:\\nDated: 15 November 2006\\n\\n\\n Counsel for the Applicant: Mr C Slater \\n \\n Solicitor for the Applicant: Australian Securities and Investments Commission \\n \\n Counsel for the First Respondent: Ms ML Coulson \\n \\n Solicitor for the First Respondent: Hammond Worthington \\n \\n Date of Hearing: 30 October 2006 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 15 November 2006 \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2006\\/1530.html\"}}"
