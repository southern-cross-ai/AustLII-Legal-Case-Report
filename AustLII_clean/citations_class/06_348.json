However, Optus says that:\\n \\n\\u2022 the waiver is limited to that particular communication and does not extend to the legal advice referred to in the Alchemy Paper, in respect of which privilege has been specifically claimed;\\n \\n\\u2022 the test to apply in determining whether privilege in the legal advice has been waived is that stated in Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1999) 201 CLR 1, at [29], as follows:\\n \\n \\n \\n ' What brings about the waiver is the inconsistency, which the courts, where necessary informed by considerations of fairness, perceive, between the conduct of the client and maintenance of the confidentiality; not some overriding principle of fairness operating at large '; \\n \\n \\n\\n\\u2022 the fact that the 'gist' of the legal advice was disclosed to the applicants (as Mr Bannon SC, on behalf of Optus, concedes) is not determinative of the question of waiver, because considerations of fairness need to be taken into account; and \\n \\n\\u2022 since Optus has not sought to rely upon the legal advice in the proceedings in any way, there is no unfairness in seeking to maintain privilege in that advice.\\n\\n11 Mr Bannon argued energetically that the common law test of waiver applies in the circumstances of this case, notwithstanding the provisions of s 122 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth). I am content to deal with the application to set aside the notice to produce on the basis that, as Optus contends, common law principles apply.\\n\\n12 On that basis, however, it seems to me that Optus has waived privilege in the legal advice referred to in the Alchemy Paper. The waiver has come about because Optus has voluntarily disclosed the gist or conclusion of the legal advice recorded in the document identified in the Alchemy Paper.\\n\\n15 Gyles J noted that the primary Judge in Bennett v CEO had correctly identified the decision in Mann v Carnell as providing guidance as to the law to be applied. However, Gyles J considered that the test had been misunderstood, at least in part. His Honour said this (at [68]):\\n \\n ' The test looks to inconsistency between the disclosure that has been made by the client on the one hand and the purpose of confidentiality that underpins legal professional privilege on the other. It is not a matter simply of applying general notions of fairness as assessed by the individual judge. The authorities to which I have referred show that it is well established that for a client to deploy the substance or effect of legal advice for forensic or commercial purposes is inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality that attracts legal professional privilege. '\\n\\n17 Mr Bannon submitted that the comments made by Gyles J in the last sentence of the passage extracted in par 15, above, should be regarded as qualifying the scope of the principle applied by his Honour. However, Gyles J specifically stated that Mann v Carnell had not implicitly overruled the line of authority upon which he relied in reaching the conclusion expressed in [65] of his judgment (see par 14, above). His Honour pointed out that the question in Mann v Carnell was whether a particular kind of limited disclosure had waived client legal privilege. He considered that the reasoning in that case cast no doubt on the principles to be applied where disclosure is made by one party to a dispute to the other party, in the absence of any special arrangements as to confidence (at [66]).\",\"1\":\"13 In Bennett v Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Customs Service [2004] FCAFC 237 ; (2004) 140 FCR 101, legal representatives of the Australian Customs Service ('Customs') stated that they had given advice to Customs that a particular regulation did not prohibit all public comment by an officer on matters of public administration. Gyles J, with whom Tamberlin J agreed, considered that the primary Judge had erred in drawing a distinction between the conclusion expressed in legal advice, on the one hand, and the reasons for that conclusion, on the other. This distinction had led the primary judge to the incorrect holding that disclosure of the conclusion did not involve disclosure of the reasons (at [62]).\\n\\n14 Gyles J referred to a number of authorities supporting the proposition that a party who expresses a particular legal conclusion and asserts that it has received legal advice endorsing that view, will be taken to have waived privilege in the legal advice. Gyles J expressed agreement with this reasoning (at [65]):\\n \\n ' The voluntary disclosure of the gist or conclusion of the legal advice amounts to waiver in respect of the whole of the advice to which reference is made including the reasons for the conclusion. The primary judge was in error in drawing a distinction between conclusion and reasoning in the context of such a disclosure. '\\n\\n16 In agreeing with the analysis of Gyles J, Tamberlin J observed (at [6]) that the position in the case before the Full Court may have been different if the legal advisors to Customs had simply asserted that the client had taken legal advice and had adopted a particular position having considered that advice. Tamberlin J pointed out that in these circumstances, the substance of the advice is not disclosed, but only the fact that some advice had been given and had been considered. His Honour went on:\\n \\n 'However, once the conclusion in the advice is stated, together with the effect of it, then in my view, there is imputed waiver of the privilege. The whole point of an advice is the final conclusion.' \\n\\nLater in the judgment, his Honour observed (at [14]):\\n \\n ' Disclosure of one conclusion but not others in an advice does not necessarily amount to waiver in respect of the non-disclosed conclusions. However, if the conclusions and reasoning are so interconnected that they cannot be separated or isolated, then it may be that the whole of the advice on which all those conclusions are based, must be considered to have been waived. '\",\"2\":\"18 The principle stated in Bennett v CEO, was applied by Sundberg J in Rio Tinto Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (2005) 224 ALR 299. In that case, the Commissioner produced, in response to an application under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (Cth), an audit report. The audit report stated that the Commissioner would be relying upon certain specific grounds 'supported by ... opinions obtained from counsel.' Sundberg J held (at [49]) that:\\n \\n 'The conduct of the [Commissioner] in twice providing to the applicant an Audit Report that discloses the \\\"gist\\\" or \\\"substance\\\" of the privileged Audit Report documents is inconsistent with the maintenance of legal professional privilege over those documents and thus effects a waiver of the privilege. '\\n\\n19 I should add that I have not been invited to examine the legal advice in order to determine whether it deals with discrete issues, other than those in respect of which the Alchemy Paper records the conclusion reached. Mr Sheahan SC, on behalf of the applicants, accepted that if Optus claims that privilege in parts of the legal advice has not been waived because those parts relate to discrete issues, it may be appropriate for Optus to have an opportunity to test that claim. However, in that event, given my role in the substantive proceedings, it will be necessary for another Judge to inspect the legal advice in order to rule on Optus' claims.\\n\\n20 For the reasons I have given , subject to what is said in the previous paragraph, I consider that any privilege in the legal advice referred to in the Alchemy Paper has been waived by Optus. The waiver, in my view, extends to legal advice on any of the issues identified in par 5, above. Accordingly, Optus' motion must be dismissed. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nI certify that the preceding twenty (20) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Sackville. \\n\\nAssociate: \\n\\n\\nDated: 3 April 2006\\n\\n\\n Counsel for the sixteenth and twenty-second respondents: Mr A Bannon SC with Mr M Leeming and Mr J Hewitt \\n \\n Solicitors for the sixteenth and twenty-second respondents: Atanaskovic Hartnell \\n \\n Counsel for the applicants: Mr J Sheahan SC with Mr M Darke \\n \\n Solicitors for the applicants: Freehills \\n \\n Date of hearing: 30 March 2006 \\n \\n Date of judgment: 3 April 2006 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2006\\/348.html\"}}"
