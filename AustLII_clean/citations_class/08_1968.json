The grounds contained in the affidavit accompanying the application for leave to appeal are misconceived and no arguable basis has been advanced upon which an appeal might succeed. The applicant has not satisfied the test in D&eacute;cor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc [1991] FCA 655 ; (1991) 33 FCR 397 to warrant a grant of leave to appeal. The decision is not attended with sufficient doubt to warrant its reconsideration.\\n\\n14 The applicant has failed to show that Barnes FM erred in the exercise of her discretion. In the light of the applicant's extensive litigation history, I am satisfied that no substantial injustice would result if leave were refused, even supposing her Honour's decision to be wrong.

Federal Magistrate Barnes was satisfied (at [18]) that the application was, in effect, an attempt to reagitate the same issues that had been dealt with in past judicial review proceedings. For that reason, Barnes FM concluded that the application should be dismissed pursuant to rule 13.10(a). Her Honour also concluded that the proceedings were barred by the operation of the doctrine of Anshun estoppel (see Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Proprietary Limited [1981] HCA 45 ; (1981) 147 CLR 589). Any further arguments, including an argument based upon the High Court decision in SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 228 CLR 294 , could, her Honour pointed out, have been raised in prior proceedings.\\n\\n8 As I pointed out in SZFMW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1862 at [12] , the Full Court in Wong v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 51 ; (2004) 146 FCR 10 applied Anshun in the context of judicial review of administrative action and said at [37] that where an issue was so relevant to the subject matter of the earlier action that it would be unreasonable not to have raised it at that time, it is an abuse of process to endeavour to raise that issue for the first time in a subsequent proceeding between the parties.
