The case law indicates that the term \\\"transaction\\\" is a word of wide connotations. A transaction in its totality may include a series of events in a course of dealings initiated by a debtor intended to extinguish the debt: Re Emanuel (No. 14) Pty Ltd (in liq) ; Macks & Anor v Blacklaw & Shadforth Pty Ltd (1997) 147 ALR 281 at 288.

The \\\"winding up\\\" as referred to in the statute is the actual winding up, and not a hypothetical winding up or series of windings up as at the date of each payment: see Walsh v Natra Pty Limited [2000] VSCA 60 ; (2000) 1 VR 523.\\n\\n41 In this case, the unsecured debt owed by LSE to Corporate Finance under the Second Deed was discharged in full as a result of the challenged payments, whereas unsecured debts to other creditors were not reduced.\\n\\n42 The affidavit of Mr Tolcher of 23 August 2006 shows that Capital would have received substantially less if it had proved in the winding up of LSE as unsecured creditor.
