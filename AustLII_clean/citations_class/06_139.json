Thus, if there has been jurisdictional error due to, for example, a failure to discharge imperative duties or to observe inviolable limitations or restraints, the decision in question cannot properly be described in the terms used in section 474(2) as a \\\" decision made under this Act \\\".\\n\\n10 I have given anxious consideration to the material in the appeal papers and the submissions of the appellant for the purpose of seeing whether I can detect any arguable case of a jurisdictional error. I have also asked counsel for the Minister, pursuant to his duty to the Court, whether there is any basis, in the material before the court, on which an argument that there was a jurisdictional error might be raised other than the matters which I will discuss next. There was not identified by counsel or myself any such error which might be argued to exist. The judge below considered carefully and in detail each basis which the appellant put to him, many of which he also put to me.\\n\\n11 Before turning to those issues, I should turn to a submission made at the outset of the appeal today by the appellant who said that the learned trial judge was biased because, in effect, he had upheld the appeal or I think, to use the appellant's words, supported what the Tribunal had done. I am not sure whether the appellant intended to connote anything more than he believed that the result was wrong and that the trial judge should not have found, as he did, that the Tribunal's decision revealed no error amenable to correction.\",\"3\":\"25 The decisions of Full Courts of this Court referred to in his Honour's reasons, namely, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v NAMW [2004] FCAFC 264 ; (2004) 140 FCR 572 and QAAC of 2004 v Refugee Review Tribunal [2005] FCAFC 92 , show that no jurisdictional error was committed by the Tribunal in failing to give particulars to the appellant of the information contained in the country information to which I have referred.\",\"4\":\"8 This appeal essentially turns on the issue of whether the appellant has been able to establish a jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal.
