The second respondent appeared to take no active part in the proceedings. In my view there should be no order in respect of costs for or against the second respondent: New South Wales Dairy Corporation v Murray-Goulburn Co-Operative Company Limited (1989) 14 IPR 75 at [80].

A significant amount of time and evidence were taken up during the trial in relation to those unsuccessful defences.\"}}"
