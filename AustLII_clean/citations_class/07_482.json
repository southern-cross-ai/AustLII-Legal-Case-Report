The first plaintiff was the director and company secretary, but not a shareholder of ACMF. Although the expression 'person aggrieved' is not defined in the Corporations Act , the term is understood in a different sense to its literal meaning. A person aggrieved is not someone who is merely dissatisfied by an event. A person aggrieved must be a person who has been damaged or injured in a legal sense: a person who has a legal grievance: Ealing Corporation v Jones [1959] 1 QB 384 at 391; Re G A & R J Elliot Pty Ltd; ex parte Mitcham (1978) 3 ACLR 523 at 525; GIS Electrical Pty Ltd v Melsom [2002] WASCA 302 ; (2002) 172 FLR 218. The applicant contended that merely being a director is not enough: Casali v Crisp [2001] NSWSC 860 ; (2001) 165 FLR 79.\\n\\n51 The authorities suggest, as the applicant contended, that merely because a person is a shareholder or a director that is not enough to establish that a person is a person aggrieved. In this case, the first plaintiff is merely a director. However, upon his own evidence, the first plaintiff is the person who, by his own inaction, caused deregistration of ACMF. There is presently no suggestion that the first plaintiff might be prosecuted for a contravention of s 188 of the Corporations Act . As the secretary of ACMF, it was his responsibility to attend to the various matters in s 188(1) of the Corporations Act . Although there is presently no suggestion that any proceedings might be brought against the first plaintiff in relation to whatever breach of duty he committed, that is a risk, it seems to me, which would entitle the first plaintiff to say that he is a person aggrieved. The first plaintiff's conduct might have put some sort of legal burden on him that would be partly relieved by ACMF's reregistration: Ealing Corporation [1959] 1 QB at 391. In those circumstances, notwithstanding that the first plaintiff is a director and secretary only, in my opinion, he is a person aggrieved because he has a real and direct interest in the reregistration of ACMF: Denis & Ors v McMahon (1989) 7 ACLC 283.\",\"7\":\"50 The next question to be addressed is whether the first plaintiff is a person aggrieved by the deregistration.

However, if a shareholder can show that the shareholder might benefit from reinstatement by sharing in the assets of the company or obtaining a dividend of some kind that may make the shareholder a person aggrieved: Casali v Crisp [2001] NSWSC 860 ; 165 FLR 79. In this case, ACMF, if reregistered, has the potential of obtaining a judgment in the order of $290,000 with a consequential return to the shareholder, Claremont. In my opinion, Claremont is a person aggrieved because it will stand to benefit by ACMF's reregistration which allows it to prosecute its proceedings in the District Court. It will benefit if the litigation is successful to the extent of $290,000. It is not to the point, in my opinion, that Claremont is the trustee of the Callegher Family Trust and, as such, would not benefit in its own right if the action were successful. It has the responsibilities of a trustee to maintain the trust assets. The shareholding in ACMF has a significant value if the proceedings in the District Court are successful. In those circumstances, Claremont has the responsibility as trustee of maintaining that asset, being the shareholding in ACMF.\\n\\n54 It was contended that the sale of the shares by ACMF to Mr De Angelis was completed on 3 March 2004 and Claremont did not become a shareholder in ACMF until 21 October 2004. It was contended, in those circumstances, that Claremont did not have a relevant interest in ACMF. That contention must be rejected. It is not to the point that Claremont did not become a shareholder in ACMF until after the loan was made by ACMF to Mr De Angelis (if in fact that be the case). If ACMF was possessed of an asset, being the loan, and if later Claremont became its sole shareholder, then Claremont had the rights of a sole shareholder in relation to that asset.\",\"10\":\"51 The authorities suggest, as the applicant contended, that merely because a person is a shareholder or a director that is not enough to establish that a person is a person aggrieved.

It has by its director undertaken to remedy that default. ASIC does not object to the reinstatement of the reregistration of ACMF. ASIC's attitude should be taken into account. It should be clearly understood that a company which has been deregistered for failing to comply with its statutory obligations could not be expected to be reregistered as of right. More is required. The Court must be satisfied that it would be just to order the reinstatement of the registration. The words of the section give the Court a very wide discretion. In exercising that discretion, which must remain unfettered, the Court will ordinarily have regard to the circumstances in which the company's registration lapsed; the party seeking the order; the reasons for seeking the order; the utility of making any order; the prejudice which any party including the company which is sought to be the subject of the order for reinstatement of the registration might suffer; and any other circumstances which would bear upon the making of an order which in all the circumstances would be just: see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Securities and Investment Commission (2000) 174 ALR 688. In making the order it must also be steadily borne in mind that the company's registration is not to be reinstated for a particular purpose but the company's registration will be reinstated for all purposes: Donmastry Pty Ltd v Albarran (2004) 49 ACSR 745 at 747.\",\"12\":\"55 ACMF came to be deregistered because of the default of its director in failing to pay an ASIC fee.

It was submitted that the reasoning in Knight v FP Special Assets Ltd [1992] HCA 28 ; (1992) 174 CLR 178 may not be apposite having regard to the statutory powers of the District Court to award costs against a non-party. I think that argument must be rejected. In Vestris v Cashman (1999) 72 SASR 449, the Full Court of the Supreme Court considered the District Court's power to award costs against non-parties. Following upon that decision, s 42 of the District Court Act 1991 (SA) was amended to make it clear that costs could be awarded by the Court against any party, whether a party to or a witness in the proceedings or not: s 42 of the District Court Act 1991 (SA).\",\"14\":\"64 It was put that Claremont may elect to fund ACMF in the District Court action without itself incurring any liability for the applicant's costs in the event that the applicant were successful in defending the proceedings.
