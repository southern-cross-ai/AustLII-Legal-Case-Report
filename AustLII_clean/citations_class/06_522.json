Condition 8202 provides as follows:\\n \\n '8202 (1) The holder (other than the holder of a Subclass 560 (Student) visa who is an AusAID student or the holder of a Subclass 576 (AusAID or Defence Sector) visa) must meet the requirements of subclauses (2) and (3). \\n \\n (2) A holder meets the requirements of this subclause if: \\n \\n (a) the holder is enrolled in a registered course; or \\n \\n (b) in the case of the holder of a Subclass 560 or 571 (Schools Sector) visa who is a secondary exchange student the holder is enrolled in a full-time course of study or training. \\n \\n (3) A holder meets the requirements of this subclause if: \\n \\n (a) in the case of a holder whose education provider keeps attendance records the Minister is satisfied that the holder attends for at least 80% of the contact hours scheduled: \\n \\n \\n (i) for a course that runs for less than a semester for the course; or \\n \\n \\n \\n (ii) for a course that runs for at least a semester for each term and semester of the course; and \\n \\n \\n (b) in any case the holder achieves an academic result that is certified by the education provider to be at least satisfactory: \\n \\n (i) for a course that runs for less than a semester for the course; or \\n \\n \\n (ii) for a course that runs for at least a semester for each term or semester (whichever is shorter) of the course. \\n \\n \\n (4) In the case of the holder of a Subclass 560 visa who is an AusAID student or the holder of a Subclass 576 (AusAID or Defence Sector) visa the holder is enrolled in a full-time course of study or training.'\",\"1\":\"35 I accept the submissions of the first respondent. In determining whether to withhold relief on the grounds of futility, the Full Court in VAAD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 117 applied a test which asked whether the jurisdictional error was one 'which could possibly have deprived the appellants of a successful outcome to their application for review'. In this case, the jurisdictional error was not one which could possibly have deprived the applicant of a successful outcome to his review before the Tribunal. The evidence shows even if the attendance record is assessed by reference to the period of 7 October 2003 to 28 November 2003, which is the period referred to in the Notice of Intention to Consider Cancellation, and the period referred to in the s 20 Notice and the Certificate of Attendance, the applicant's attendance record did not meet the 80 per cent requirement. Accordingly, if the matter was remitted to the Tribunal, it could not possibly reach the necessary state of satisfaction as would permit compliance by the applicant in accordance with Condition 8202(3)(a)(ii). Further, there would be no procedural unfairness to the applicant in withholding relief on this basis because the applicant was given the opportunity to make submissions on his attendance record over the full period of the second term, and by his letter of 23 April 2004 took advantage of that opportunity. In my view, this is a case where, in the exercise of my discretion, relief should be withheld on the basis that it would be futile to send the matter back to the Tribunal.\\n\\n36 The third ground relied on was that the cancellation of the decision was contrary to the principle of 'substantive fairness'.\\n\\n37 This ground does not disclose a head of jurisdictional error. Counsel for the first respondent, however, treated this ground as a complaint about procedural fairness. There was, in my view, no breach of procedural fairness.\",\"2\":\"43 The appeal in Zhou is still pending. However, the first respondent has drawn my attention to Humayun v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 35 ('Humayun') a decision of the Full Court which was delivered on 22 March 2006. Wilcox J (with whom Conti and Stone JJ agreed) said:\\n \\n 'Mr Catterns argued the s 20 notice, issued to Mr Humayun on 7 February 2003, was defective for the reasons enunciated by Mr McInnis FM in Zhou v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 1) [2005] FMCA 1826. That case is presently under appeal so it is preferable for me not to offer any views about its correctness. Counsel for the Minister contended that, even if the s 20 notice was incapable of having the consequences set out under Subdivision GB of Division 3 of the Migration Act (ss 137J-137P), that did not affect the power of the delegate to effect a visa cancellation under s 116 of the Act. They referred to the judgment of Allsop J (with whom Tamberlin J agreed) in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Yu [2004] FCAFC 333 ; 141 FCR 448. Furthermore, said counsel, a legal deficiency in the delegate's decision would not affect the power of the MRT to review the reported decision and to make such order as the delegate ought to have made. They cited three recent Full Court decisions: Zubair v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 248 , 211 ALR 261; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Ahmed [2005] FCAFC 58 , 143 FCR 314 and Uddin v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 218. \\n \\n Both the respondents' contentions are correct. There is nothing in this point.'\\n\\n44 By reason of the Full Court in Humayun having considered and rejected the grounds underlying the Federal Magistrate's decision in Zhou , there appears to be no utility in awaiting the outcome of the Full Court appeal in Zhou .\\n\\n45 I accordingly dismiss the application with costs.\\n \\n\\n I certify that the preceding forty-five (45) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Siopis. \\n\\n\\nAssociate:\\n\\nDated: 8 May 2006\\n\\n\\n Counsel for the Applicant: The Applicant appeared in person \\n \\n Counsel for the Respondent: Mr P R MacLiver \\n \\n Solicitor for the First Respondent: Australian Government Solicitor \\n \\n Date of Hearings: 14 October 2005, and\\n15 February 2006 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 8 May 2006 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2006\\/522.html\"}}"
