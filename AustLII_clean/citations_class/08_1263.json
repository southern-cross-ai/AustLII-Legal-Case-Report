On 18 June 2008 the Federal Magistrates Court dismissed an application seeking to review the decision of the Tribunal: SZLZM v Minister for Immigration & Citizenship [2008] FMCA 887.\\n\\n4 The Appellant now appeals to this Court. He appeared today unrepresented, albeit with the benefit of an interpreter. He read to the Court (via his interpreter) a detailed statement in support of his appeal. That statement fully addressed the issues sought to be canvassed. Although he maintained that a copy of the Respondent Minister's submissions had only been received by him on 13 August 2008, he accepted that his statement made orally today fully set forth his case. Any further opportunity to respond would be for the purpose of reducing to writing the statement made orally. Such a further opportunity was not considered necessary. The interpreter experienced no difficulty in translating the Appellant's oral contentions.\\n\\n5 Although the present proceeding is an appeal from the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court, the Grounds of Appeal as filed in this Court do not attempt to identify any error made by the learned Federal Magistrate. Those Grounds merely set forth the errors alleged to have been committed by the Tribunal.\",\"5\":\"14 This Ground should be rejected. It was (most probably) not raised before the Federal Magistrates Court and no reason has been exposed as to why it should now be entertained. In those circumstances where this Court has a discretion to permit a new ground to be raised on appeal, there should generally be an adequate explanation for not raising the ground before the Federal Magistrates Court ( SZIBR v Minister for Immigration & Citizenship [2008] FCA 502 at [38] [41]) and leave should only be granted if it is expedient in the interests of justice to do so ( VUAX v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 158 at [46] [48]).\",\"6\":\"10 Notwithstanding the deficiency in the content of the Notice of Appeal , it nevertheless remains clear that the Appellant sought to invoke the appellate jurisdiction of this Court and not its original jurisdiction. Whatever other deficiencies there may be in his Notice of Appeal , that Notice does state (without alteration) that \\\" the appellant appeals from the whole of the judgment of the Federal Magistrate Court given on 18.6.2008 at Sydney \\\". In some circumstances, it may be accepted, it is not appropriate for this Court to deal with an application before it solely upon the basis of \\\" procedural errors committed by an unrepresented applicant \\\": eg, Thang Gia Uy Vo v Minister for Immigration & Citizenship [2007] FCA 1599 at [12] , [2007] FCA 1599 ; 101 ALD 57 at 59.\\n\\n11 In the present appeal no submission was advanced on behalf of the Respondent Minister that the appeal should be dismissed by reason of the failure of the Appellant to identify any error alleged to have been committed by the learned Federal Magistrate; indeed, the Minister's written submissions addressed the substance of each of the three purported Grounds of Appeal .\\n\\n12 But, even if the Grounds of Appeal be construed as an identification of the errors which were said to have been committed by the Tribunal, and an implicit contention that the Federal Magistrate erred in not concluding that there were such errors, no different conclusion -- it should be noted -- would have been reached and the appeal would have been dismissed.\",\"7\":\"14 This Ground should be rejected.
