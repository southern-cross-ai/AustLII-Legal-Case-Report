It is supported by Full Court authority in NALM v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 17 at [24] where their Honours held that the certificate in question did not identify a medical condition or explain why it would prevent the applicant from appearing in Court.\\n\\nNo substantive injustice would arise if leave were refused as the Court below carefully considered the merits of the applicant's substantive application and persuasively reasoned that it had no merit. The applicant's challenge to the Tribunal's decision essentially concerned questions of fact rather than the identification of judicially reviewable errors. His Honour correctly found that there was no arguable case for judicial review.\\n\\nThe application for leave to appeal is dismissed with costs.\\n I certify that the preceding nine (9) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Marshall. \\n \\n Associate:\\n \\nDated: 18 May 2009 \\n The Appellant appeared for himself. \\n \\n Counsel for the Respondents: Mr B Wee Solicitor for the Respondents: DLA Phillips Fox \\n \\n \\n Date of Hearing: 18 May 2009 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 18 May 2009 \\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2009\\/506.html\"}}"
