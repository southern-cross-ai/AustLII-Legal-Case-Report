The original basis for joinder was as the applicant authorised by the women who assert a native title interest. Worimi contends, and the original Form 1 claimant application ('the original application') states, that the Port Stephens land is a sacred site for women, in the context of childbirth.\\n\\nIf Worimi has a claim to native title over the Port Stephens land on behalf of a native title claim group, subject to compliance with the Act he would have sufficient interest to be joined to the Hillig proceedings. Mr Hillig contends, however, that if no valid assertion of native title can be made, there can be no reason to join him to those proceedings. It is insufficient for joinder to the non-claimant proceedings that Worimi seeks to prevent the sale of the land ( Hillig at [27]).\\n\\nThe original application, filed on 9 February 2006, was prepared before Worimi had legal advice.\\n\\nIn the original application the native title claim group is said to be ' the female members of the Garuahgal people who are descended from Mary Mahr born in 1847...being those aboriginal people whose traditional lands and waters are situated in the Port Stephens area of New South Wales '. Worimi asserts that authority to make the claimant application ' was given to me as the Custodian and Protector of the Garuahgal Women '.\",\"6\":\"Mr Dates now applies to be joined to the non-claimant application on the basis of a native title interest held by the claim group of the proposed application, that is, himself and his family. Mr Hillig opposes the joinder of Mr Dates in either capacity. In particular he submits that, in order to establish native title, Mr Dates must comply with the requirements of the Act as they apply to a claimant. A claimed existence of native title must meet the requirements of s 61, s 61A and s 62 of the Act which apply to claimant applications ( Kanak v Minister for Land and Water Conservation [2000] FCA 1105 ; (2000) 106 FCR 31 at [11] ).

It is necessary to consider the original application as filed, the proposed application and the evidence already filed by Worimi. It is also relevant to consider whether the original application can be amended to substitute the proposed claim group for the original claim group. The determination is to be made on the most favourable view of the evidence adduced by Worimi ( Landers v State of South Australia [2003] FCA 264 ; (2003) 128 FCR 495 at [7] per Mansfield J).\\n\\nThe proposition advanced by Mr Wright, counsel for Mr Hillig, is that, on Worimi's own case, the claim group is incapable of meeting the requirements of the Act, either as described in the original application or as described in the proposed application. Ms Jowett put a number of possibilities to the Court in support of the proposed claim group and referred to the nature of evidence that could be adduced in support of those possibilities. I have taken those into account, even though they were only raised as possibilities or possible scenarios.\\n\\nMr Wright's proposition is that, as a matter of construction, the proposed claim group can not be one that can make the claim, even if, as a sub-group of the original claim group, the members were to authorise Worimi to bring the proposed application. Further, Worimi now makes a claim on his own behalf, a claim that he has expressly negated on previous occasions.\\n\\nPerry M and Lloyd S, Australian Native Title Law (Lawbook Co, 2003) conclude at [15.1380] that the expression \\\"native title claim group\\\" in s 61(1) of the Act refers to ' the whole group of persons who hold native title over an area and cannot comprise a subgroup which accepts that it is part only of a larger group of native title holders '.

In Mabo v the State of Queensland (No 2) [1992] HCA 23 ; (1992) 175 CLR 1 at 52, Brennan J acknowledged ' individual, non-proprietary rights that are derived from the community's laws and customs and are dependent on the community title. A fortiori, there can be no impediment to the recognition of individual proprietary rights '. His Honour added at 60 that there can be protection of interests: \\n \\n members of an indigenous clan or group, whether communally or individually, only in conformity with the traditional laws and customs of the people to whom the clan or group belongs and only where members of the clan or group acknowledge those laws and observe those customs (so far as it is practicable to do so).'\\n\\nIn Bodney , Mr Bodney's position at the appeal was that the group that he represented and on whose behalf he had been authorised to bring applications was composed of the only living descendants of the traditional owners. Accordingly, his position was that they were not a sub-group but the whole of the group described in the application as the Ballaruk and Didjarruk people (at [71]). There was contrary evidence from relatives outside the family that constituted the sub-group but Mr Bodney did not have the opportunity to cross-examine them as they were not present in Court. As Branson J said at [31], it was possible that the small group on whose behalf Mr Bodney made his claims was also the whole of the group alleged by him to hold the claimed native title rights and interests. Her Honour declined to form a concluded view as to whether a sub-group of those who are alleged to hold the relevant native title rights and interests are permitted to make a native title application but the claim must, in any event, be authorised by the small group (at [34]).\\n\\nAs Brennan J said in Mabo (No 2) at 60, the interests of members of an indigenous clan or group can be protected, communally or individually, only in conformity with the traditional laws and customs of the people to whom the clan or group belongs. The origins of the content of the law or custom are to be found in the normative rules of the Aboriginal society that existed before the assertion of sovereignty ( Members of the Yorta Yorta Aboriginal Community v State of Victoria [2002] HCA 58 ; (2002) 214 CLR 422 at [46] per Gleeson CJ and Gummow and Hayne JJ). That inquiry does not concern only the laws and customs which now are acknowledged ( Yorta Yorta at [59]).\",\"10\":\"Mr Hillig contends that the claim group has not been properly identified and, as it is not properly constituted, the claim cannot proceed. Mr Hillig refers to McKenzie v State Government of South Australia (2005) 214 ALR 214 and Dieri People v State of South Australia [2003] FCA 187 ; (2003) 127 FCR 364 in support of that proposition.\\n\\nPerry M and Lloyd S, Australian Native Title Law (Lawbook Co, 2003) conclude at [15.1380] that the expression \\\"native title claim group\\\" in s 61(1) of the Act refers to ' the whole group of persons who hold native title over an area and cannot comprise a subgroup which accepts that it is part only of a larger group of native title holders '.

They assert individual or group native title rights and interests. It is not the case that the proposed claim group identifies the earlier claim group with more certainty. The intention is to change the persons on whose behalf the application is to be brought (cf Wharton on behalf of the Kooma People v State of Queensland [2003] FCA 1398 at [33] ).\\n\\nMs Jowett submits that it may be that Mr Dates and, through him his family, have the sole rights arising from biological descent. This submission is made, in part, in response to the evidence of other persons within the claimed biological descent from Mary Mahr and members of the Worimi and Maaiangal clans including Mr Dates' brother, to the effect that no native title existed over the Port Stephens land and that it was not a women's site. Ms Jowett raises the possibility that it was only to Worimi that the relevant interest passed according to custom. It cannot be assumed that any rights and interests now recognised must necessarily be held by all of the living descendants of those who held the rights and interests at sovereignty ( Bodney per Branson J at [31]). A claimant sub-group may be able to establish authorisation by reason of customary law even where a wider group did not authorise the bringing of a claim ( Bodney per Stone J at [90] with whom Spender and Branson JJ agreed).\"}}"
