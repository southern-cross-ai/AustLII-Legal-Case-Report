There is no jurisdictional error apparent in the Tribunal's decision or in the decision of Smith FM. The Court is satisfied that there is no merit in the applicant's substantial application.\",\"1\":\"21 The Court observes that in considering whether to grant an extension of time to file a notice of appeal under O 52 r 15(2) of the Rules, the Court must be satisfied that there is an acceptable explanation for the delay, that there would be no undue prejudice to the respondent if the Court were to grant leave, and that there is merit in the substantial application: see Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen (1984) 3 FCR 344 at 348-349. There appears to be no valid reason why such considerations should not also apply to an application seeking an order of the Court that dispenses with the 21 day time limit prescribed by O 52 r 5(2) of the Rules.\\n\\n22 As to delay, the applicant claimed at the hearing before the Court that her ignorance of Court procedure resulted in her failure to comply with O 52 r 5(2) of the Rules. Because the applicant is unrepresented and the delay is not extensive, the Court is prepared to accept this explanation.\\n\\n23 There is no evidence before the Court that the Minister would be prejudiced if the Court were to grant an order dispensing with compliance with O 52 r 5(2) of the Rules.\",\"2\":\"24 In considering the merits of the substantial application, the Court observes that the first ground alleging bias by the Tribunal had not been raised before Smith FM. Accordingly leave would be required for the applicant to raise such ground on appeal: see Iyer v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1788 at [22] - [24] . Leave may be granted if it is 'expedient in the interests of justice to allow the new ground to be argued and determined' : see VAAC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 74 ; (2003) 129 FCR 168 at [26] .
