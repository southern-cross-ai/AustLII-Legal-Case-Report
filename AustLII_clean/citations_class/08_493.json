It is just for AIA to receive costs on an indemnity basis in respect of the issues which the Court is satisfied were raised without any factual basis and those which were pursued falsely to the knowledge of the applicants. Since these matters largely occupied hearing time from 11 September 2007, in accordance with the principles in Re Wilcox; Ex parte Venture Industries Pty Ltd and Others (No 2) (1996) 72 FCR 151 at 156-158 and Amadio Pty Ltd and Another v Henderson and Others (1998) 81 FCR 149 at 258-259, the Court will order the applicants to pay indemnity costs to AIA from that date.\",\"1\":\"7 Alternatively, AIA submits that it should be entitled to indemnity costs from 15 June 2007. By letter of this date AIA's solicitors, Ebsworth and Ebsworth, made an offer of settlement which was stated to be written in accordance with the principle referred to in Calderbank v Calderbank [1975] 3 All ER 333 ('the Calderbank letter'). The Calderbank letter attached copies of the receipts and copies of correspondence written by Mr Xu to AIA complaining that although he had paid cash to Mr Yang for the renewal of his policies his policies had been cancelled. The Calderbank letter proposed that each party pay their own costs and the proceedings be abandoned. Such offer was not accepted.\\n\\n8 The applicants oppose the orders sought. They submit that their claim was predicated upon various representations which were alleged to have been made by AIA to Mr Yang at the time of his engagement as an agent of AIA. The applicants submit that the evidence of Ms Lin disputing the grant of authority to issue the receipts was not provided until approximately September 2007 which was at a late stage of the proceedings and that the applicants' claim was keenly fought in respect of numerous factual issues.\\n\\n9 Section 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) ('the Act') empowers the Court to make orders for costs. Subsection 43(1) of the Act empowers the Court or a Judge thereof to award costs in all proceedings before the Court except those proceedings in respect of which any other Act provides that costs shall not be awarded. Subsection 43(2) of the Act provides:\\n \\n Except as provided by any other Act, the award of costs is in the discretion of the Court or Judge.\",\"2\":\"5 AIA submits that the principles referred to by Sheppard J in Colgate-Palmolive Company and Another v Cussons Pty Limited (1993) 46 FCR 225 apply in respect of proceedings which are conducted in such manner such as to warrant an order for indemnity costs. At page 233 his Honour observed that orders for indemnity costs might be made where proceedings had been conducted:\\n \\n ... in wilful disregard of known facts or clearly established law (Woodward J in Fountain and French J in J-Corp (supra)); the making of allegations which ought never to have been made or the undue prolongation of a case by groundless contentions (Davies J in Ragata ); an imprudent refusal of an offer to compromise (eg Messiter v Hutchinson (1987) 10 NSWLR 525, Maitland Hospital v Fisher (No 2) (1992) 27 NSWLR 721 at 724 (Court of Appeal); Crisp v Keng (unreported, Court of Appeal, NSW, Kirby P, Priestley JA, Cripps JA, No 40744\\/1992, 27 September 1993)...\\n\\n21 The allegations made by the applicants concerning the issue of the receipts were wholly inconsistent with the objective facts. The Court is satisfied that such allegations were groundless. Further, there was no factual basis to support the claim that AIA had manipulated the records. The applicants' claims relating to the issue of the receipts and of the computer records should never have been raised (see Colgate-Palmolive v Cussons per Sheppard J at 233).\",\"3\":\"12 It has been recognised that where a party has caused another party or parties to incur unnecessary costs, an order that costs be paid on an indemnity basis may be made. In Degmam Pty Ltd (In liq) v Wright (No 2) (1983) 2 NSWLR 354, Holland J at 358 found that a party had raised false defences which were deliberately concocted to deny the other party its rights. His Honour observed that such conduct grossly prolonged the litigation, causing 'the other parties to incur liability for solicitor and client costs far beyond what they could reasonably have expected to incur in litigation of genuine issues' .
