However, Diageo submits that it is trite that a statement of claim must only plead material facts and not evidence or legal propositions: O 11 r 2; North-Western Salt Company Ltd v Electrolytic Alkali Company Ltd [1913] 3 KB 422 at 425.\\n\\nAccordingly, Diageo submitted that leave should not be granted with respect to the amendments in paras 47C, 47D and 48A to 48C. They amount to statements of legal propositions and are embarrassing. For this reason, no leave should be given to amend paras 48 and 49 because Spirits have not pleaded any material facts in support of the amendments.\\n\\nWhen pressed, Senior Counsel for Spirits submitted that the opening words of para 48: 'By reason of the matters pleaded above ...', is a reference to paras 38 to 47D of the proposed FASC, and that para 47D is a pleading of fact. I tend to agree with the latter submission although it might be more accurate to describe para 47D as a pleading of mixed fact and law, as it would be to describe a number of the other pleadings from para 38 onwards.\",\"6\":\"The starting point is that all of such amendments should be made as are necessary to enable the real questions in controversy between the parties to be decided: Queensland v J L Holdings Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 1 ; (1997) 189 CLR 146; Dresna Pty Ltd v Misu Nominees Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 1537.

Diageo submits that a pleading must state with particular clarity the factual basis upon which a foundation of a cause of action under Pt V of the Trade Practices Act 1976 (Cth) ('the TPA') is based: Truth About Motorways Pty Ltd v Macquarie Infrastructure Investment Management Ltd (1998) ATPR 41-633 at 40,977.\\n\\nI am not sure that I fully comprehend what lies behind the submission that the proposed amendments are embarrassing to Diageo. Diageo's submission that it is unable to understand and plead a response flies in the face of a plea in denial; such a pleading may turn out to be embarrassing, but any embarrassment in those circumstances will be at the feet of Spirits' articulation of their pleading and not at the feet of Diageo's response. I do not view such a prospect as a basis for necessarily withholding leave to amend; in certain circumstances it may be. The real issue on the motion is whether such circumstances exist in the present case.\\n\\nSpirits plead no cause of action and make no claim for relief against Federal Treasury Enterprise (FKP) Sojuzplodoimport ('FKPS'), the party nominally titled 'the Second Respondent'. FKPS was joined as the second respondent to this proceeding by order of Gyles J in December 2004, for the purpose only of enabling FKPS to file and serve a cross-claim against Spirits.\\n\\nThis proceeding was commenced by Spirits against Diageo by way of application and statement of claim filed on 7 December 2004.\\n\\nOn 2 December 2005 Spirits filed an Amended Application and Amended Statement of Claim ('ASC') with the leave of the Court. Diageo consented to the grant of leave in that instance.\"}}"
