If something remains to be ascertained which is necessary for the careful application of the discovery, that affords sufficient room for another valid patent.\\\"\\n\\n66 Mr Ben-Meir propounded a disclosure analysis of the Euro-patent which saw all the integers of the patent in suit disclosed. Dr Clarke agreed with the \\\"technical substance\\\" of Mr Ben-Meir's disclosure analysis, but he expressed the view that the disclosure was not such as to amount to instruction in that he did not think that the Euro-patent provided a person skilled in the art with sufficient information to implement a system contemplated by the patent in suit.\\n\\n67 Thus the parties were apart on the degree or quality of the exemplification or disclosure in the Euro-patent. Before turning to that question, it is important to appreciate the significance to this aspect of the case of my view of integer (d)(v) for claim 1 and integer (g) for claim 13. My disagreement with the applicants' construction of the aspect of claims 1 and 13 about the means for processing data operating to apply the promotional program rules to user personal data, means that it is necessary for the Euro-patent to reveal in the relevant sense a system and a method whereby that element is disclosed not merely a system of a card \\\"belonging to\\\" or \\\"identified with\\\" one person or a unique number which has points updated after purchasing pursuant to some algorithm, as in the Sushi Train system. My views on the construction of integer (d)(v) of claim 1 and integer (g) of claim 13 make it possible for me to express my views about the question of anticipation fairly shortly.\",\"4\":\"64 The reverse infringement test cannot be applied literally: see Nicaro Holdings Pty Ltd v Martin Engineering Co (1990) 91 ALR 513 at 528 and R D Werner & Co Inc v Bailey Aluminium Products Pty Ltd (1989) 25 FCR 565 at 568-569.
