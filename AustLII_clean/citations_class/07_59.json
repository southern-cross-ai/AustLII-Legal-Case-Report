Thus, in a practical sense, a grant of the status of eligible applicant was a step towards an examination which was either inevitable or highly likely. In my opinion, that practical consequence does not mean that the difference between the stages explained in Re Excel 52 FCR 69 can be elided. In Ainsworth Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ said (175 CLR at 576): \\n \\n '... what is decisive is the nature of the power, not the character of the proceeding which attends its exercise.' \\n \\n\\nEither the statutory power is subject to the obligation to afford prior notice or it is not. The circumstances of the particular application for exercise of the power do not affect the question as to whether the implied obligation has any operation in relation to the power in question. The decision to authorise the Evans did not itself directly adversely affect the interests of others in the manner required to bring the statutory presumption into play.\\n\\nAinsworth [1992] HCA 10 ; 175 CLR 564 concerned publication of a damning report. The same can be said of Testro Bros Pty Ltd v Tait [1963] HCA 29 ; (1963) 109 CLR 353 that was effectively overruled by Annetts v McCann (per Mason CJ, Dean and McHugh JJ 170 CLR at 598) and Ainsworth (per Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ 175 CLR at 576 577).\\n\\nFor the sake of completeness I should deal with two arguments raised on behalf of ASIC, each of which I would reject if I had been of a different view concerning the duty to accord natural justice. The first was that the decision here was a step or stage in a process, the end result of which would entail procedural fairness ( Ainsworth per Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ 175 CLR at 578; South Australia v O'Shea [1987] HCA 39 ; (1987) 163 CLR 378 per Mason CJ at 389). It was argued that the position was not dissimilar to the lack of any requirement to afford a hearing prior to the commencement of a prosecution of a like proceeding ( Barton v The Queen [1980] HCA 48 ; (1980) 147 CLR 75 at 95; Cornall v AB (A Solicitor) [1995] 1 VR 372 at 396 397; Commissioner of Police v Reid 16 NSWLR at 461; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Plymin (No 3) [2002] VSC 358 ; (2002) 170 FLR 128 at 135 136). In the first place, it is doubtful whether there is a single decision making process of the kind referred to in the present circumstances. The decision by ASIC in relation to authorisation involves different questions and different issues than would a decision to issue a summons by the Court or the conduct of the proceeding itself (cf McHugh J in Johns v Australian Securities Commission 178 CLR at 473 474 and see Re Excel 52 FCR at 83 84 and 86). It is difficult to see how failure to accord natural justice in relation to the decision in question could be cured by later events. In the second place, the examination procedure is not designed to accord natural justice to a party in relation to any allegations made, directly or indirectly, against the examinee. The process is inquisitorial rather than adversarial. There is no case put against the examinee or any case in reply. As Windeyer J said in Rees v Kratzmann (114 CLR at 80): \\n \\n 'The honest conduct of the affairs of companies is a matter of great public concern to-day. If the legislature thinks that in this field the public interest overcomes some of the common law's traditional consideration for the individual, then effect must be given to the statute which embodies this policy.' \\n \\n\\n(See also Hamilton v Oades [1989] HCA 21 ; (1989) 166 CLR 486.) The fact that the Court maintains considerable control over the examination does not change the information gathering nature of the function being performed. The analogy with the institution of Court proceedings is not apt.\",\"1\":\"In Annetts v McCann [1990] HCA 57 ; (1990) 170 CLR 596, Mason CJ, Deane and McHugh JJ said (170 CLR at 598): \\n \\n 'It can now be taken as settled that, when a statute confers power upon a public official to destroy, defeat or prejudice a person's rights, interests or legitimate expectations, the rules of natural justice regulate the exercise of that power unless they are excluded by plain words of necessary intendment ...' \\n \\n\\nIn Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission [1992] HCA 10 ; (1992) 175 CLR 564 it was held that reputation, including business or commercial reputation, is an interest that may attract the protection of the rules of procedural fairness.\\n\\nIt is also submitted that the common law right to maintain silence will be encroached upon. It is not clear to me that the so called common law right to silence is a right or interest in the sense outlined in Annetts v McCann [1990] HCA 57 ; 170 CLR 596 . The only authority that was cited to support that proposition, apart from the reference in the passage from the reasons of Dawson J in Johns v Australian Securities Commission 178 CLR at 437, was that of Branson J in Re Cortaus Ltd (in liq); Sheahan v Joye (No 2) (1996) 20 ACSR 576 at 578. That was an examination of the balance of convenience on an application for a contested adjournment and did not involve the present issue. There is merit in the submission by counsel for ASIC that it is hardly correct to say that an officer of a company that is in external administration has any right to silence concerning the affairs of the company. On the contrary, the officer is bound by statute, when called upon, to provide information. That has been the case for a very long time ( Rees v Kratzmann [1965] HCA 49 ; 114 CLR 63; Evans v Wainter 145 FCR per Lander J at [44] [82]; per French J in Highstoke Pty Ltd v Hayes Knight GTO Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 13 at [46] [78]).\\n\\nAinsworth [1992] HCA 10 ; 175 CLR 564 concerned publication of a damning report.

In any event, where, as here, the exercise of a power is anterior to that which has a direct effect upon the party, there is no such requirement.\",\"2\":\"The second argument was that if ASIC had notified the Administrators prior to the decision, so giving them the opportunity of making submissions in opposition, there is no reason to suppose that would have produced a different outcome ( Stead v State Government Insurance Commission [1986] HCA 54 ; (1986) 161 CLR 141). It was submitted that ASIC had received significant submissions from or on behalf of the Administrators in relation to the original investigation and in relation to the release of transcripts which said all that could be said, as was revealed by the nature of the response made when the authorisation was known. Counsel for ASIC submitted that the evidence suggested that ASIC took those considerations into account. Some of the difficulties of applying the Stead principle were discussed by McHugh, Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ in Applicant NAFF of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] HCA 62 ; (2004) 221 CLR 1 at [34] . In the present case, the question was whether particular persons should be appointed as eligible applicants. I can see no evidence that that topic was addressed in the submissions made on behalf of the Administrators prior to the decision being made.\",\"3\":\"For the sake of completeness I should deal with two arguments raised on behalf of ASIC, each of which I would reject if I had been of a different view concerning the duty to accord natural justice.

The analogy with the institution of Court proceedings is not apt.\",\"7\":\"During the hearing an issue arose as to whether the nature of certain submissions made by counsel for ASIC waived legal professional privilege in certain parts of the Spear Report and the incorporated report based upon the reasoning of the Full Court in Commissioner of Taxation v Rio Tinto [2006] FCAFC 86 ; (2006) 151 FCR 341. After hearing argument on behalf of the Administrators I said: \\n \\n 'I am not persuaded that a defensive argument or submission deploys the substance of legal advice in the way the authorities require ...' \\n \\n\\nFurther argument was then presented by counsel and, after further reflection, I adhered to my opinion and rejected the application for access to the whole of the documents in question.\\n\\nAttention was particularly drawn to pars 74 80 of ASIC's written submissions. The submissions in question were an answer to the argument that par 23 of the Gray Memorandum was irrational. It is sufficient to set out par 75 and par 80 to understand the argument: \\n \\n \\n '75. In such a complex case, Mr Gray, in his memorandum to Mr Taylor, was entirely reasonably adverting to the possibility that ASIC's own conclusion as to prospects was not infallible or the only view which could be said to be reasonably or even possibly open, especially in circumstances where ASIC had only examined four persons and the applicants had signalled an intention to examine additional persons. \\n \\n \\n ... \\n \\n \\n 80. The most that can be said of the material is that it indicated that there was insufficient evidence for ASIC to take action. ASIC is a public body with has limited resources to take legal action. As a public prosecutor, ASIC needs to exercise caution before taking steps against private persons. It does not follow from there being insufficient prospects of success for ASIC to take action that there are insufficient prospects of success for a private person to take action. For the same reason, it did not follow from this result of the investigation that the examinations would be futile.'\\n\\nIt was submitted that ASIC's reference to 'complex' connoted some form of assessment of the merits which could not be tested without having access to all of the underlying material. It followed that it would be unfair not to have such access to counter that which was put forward on behalf of ASIC.\\n\\nRio Tinto [2006] FCAFC 86 ; 151 FCR 341 concerned an interlocutory discovery issue. The common law was applied and the test was expressed as follows (151 FCR at [61]): \\n \\n 'Both before and after Mann , the governing principle required a fact-based inquiry as to whether, in effect, the privilege holder had directly or indirectly put the contents of an otherwise privileged communication in issue in litigation, either in making a claim or by way of defence. In DSE (at [58]) Allsop J put the matter somewhat more descriptively, saying waiver arises when: \\\"the party entitled to the privilege makes an assertion (express or implied), or brings a case, which is either about the contents of the confidential communication or which necessarily lays open the confidential communication to scrutiny and, by such conduct, an inconsistency arises between the act and the maintenance of the confidence, informed partly by the forensic unfairness of allowing the claim to proceed without disclosure of the communication\\\".' \\n (emphasis in original)\\n\\nCounsel for ASIC submitted that as the point here arose at the hearing, it was governed by s 122 of the Evidence Act rather than the common law. It was not necessary to decide that question as I was not persuaded that the application should succeed on the basis put forward.\\n\\nThe reasons in Rio Tinto 151 FCR from [64] [68] make clear that it was a special case, depending upon the form of particulars given by the Commissioner.

It was argued that the position was not dissimilar to the lack of any requirement to afford a hearing prior to the commencement of a prosecution of a like proceeding ( Barton v The Queen [1980] HCA 48 ; (1980) 147 CLR 75 at 95; Cornall v AB (A Solicitor) [1995] 1 VR 372 at 396 397; Commissioner of Police v Reid 16 NSWLR at 461; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Plymin (No 3) [2002] VSC 358 ; (2002) 170 FLR 128 at 135 136).

The analogy with the institution of Court proceedings is not apt.\",\"9\":\"The private examination of persons pursuant to Div 2 of Pt 3 of the ASIC Act in aid of an investigation by ASIC pursuant to Div 1 of Pt 3 has a different history, role and purpose from examinations pursuant to Div 1 of Pt 5.9 of the Corporations Act . The latter are a long standing feature of insolvency administration, the history, nature and purpose of which have been analysed in many cases most recently by Lander J in Evans v Wainter Pty Limited [2005] FCAFC 114 ; (2005) 145 FCR 176 and French J in Highstoke Pty Ltd v Hayes Knight GTO Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 13 and need not be repeated.\\n\\nCounsel for Macquarie also put a variation upon those themes. Reliance was placed upon some statements made by Lander J in Evans 145 FCR at 216 217 to erect a mandatory consideration, namely, that ASIC identify what was described as the 'net' benefit to a corporation of the proposed examinations, thus involving a calculus of benefits and detriments leading to a net benefit. The analysis by Lander J in the passage referred to above is, no doubt, valuable. It is not, however, a statute. It does not set out to lay down mandatory considerations for ASIC to consider before granting authorisation. It provides guidance as to what would be an abuse of process or an improper purpose. The statement that ASIC was only entitled to authorise a person who was an eligible applicant if that person's purpose in seeking an examination summons is for the benefit of the corporation, its contributories or its creditors must be understood in that context, ie, the purpose should not be a collateral purpose. There is no suggestion of any collateral purpose in the present case. Furthermore, Lander J does not hold that it is mandatory for ASIC to expressly weigh up all potential benefits and detriments to find a 'net' benefit before granting authorisation. The argument is an attempt to incorporate mandatory provisions into an unconstrained statutory discretion.\\n\\nThe Administrators did not receive prior notice of the intention to make the decision in question and, if they were entitled to natural justice or procedural fairness, it would follow that the decision was invalid by reason of that failure. It is convenient to deal with the argument that the statute impliedly required natural justice be accorded to the Administrators prior to considering the argument that the dealings between ASIC and the Administrators led to a legitimate expectation on the part of the Administrators that natural justice would be accorded to them.\\n\\nCounsel for the Administrators was unable to refer to any like case in which the point has been taken. Even more striking is that the point does not appear to have been taken in relation to the issue of a summons for examination, a decision with direct and immediate impact upon the examinee which has often been challenged. In my opinion, the argument does not withstand analysis, although it has some initial attraction.\\n\\nIt is also submitted that the common law right to maintain silence will be encroached upon. It is not clear to me that the so called common law right to silence is a right or interest in the sense outlined in Annetts v McCann [1990] HCA 57 ; 170 CLR 596 . The only authority that was cited to support that proposition, apart from the reference in the passage from the reasons of Dawson J in Johns v Australian Securities Commission 178 CLR at 437, was that of Branson J in Re Cortaus Ltd (in liq); Sheahan v Joye (No 2) (1996) 20 ACSR 576 at 578. That was an examination of the balance of convenience on an application for a contested adjournment and did not involve the present issue. There is merit in the submission by counsel for ASIC that it is hardly correct to say that an officer of a company that is in external administration has any right to silence concerning the affairs of the company. On the contrary, the officer is bound by statute, when called upon, to provide information. That has been the case for a very long time ( Rees v Kratzmann [1965] HCA 49 ; 114 CLR 63; Evans v Wainter 145 FCR per Lander J at [44] [82]; per French J in Highstoke Pty Ltd v Hayes Knight GTO Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 13 at [46] [78]).\",\"10\":\"For the sake of completeness I should deal with two arguments raised on behalf of ASIC, each of which I would reject if I had been of a different view concerning the duty to accord natural justice. The first was that the decision here was a step or stage in a process, the end result of which would entail procedural fairness ( Ainsworth per Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ 175 CLR at 578; South Australia v O'Shea [1987] HCA 39 ; (1987) 163 CLR 378 per Mason CJ at 389). It was argued that the position was not dissimilar to the lack of any requirement to afford a hearing prior to the commencement of a prosecution of a like proceeding ( Barton v The Queen [1980] HCA 48 ; (1980) 147 CLR 75 at 95; Cornall v AB (A Solicitor) [1995] 1 VR 372 at 396 397; Commissioner of Police v Reid 16 NSWLR at 461; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Plymin (No 3) [2002] VSC 358 ; (2002) 170 FLR 128 at 135 136). In the first place, it is doubtful whether there is a single decision making process of the kind referred to in the present circumstances. The decision by ASIC in relation to authorisation involves different questions and different issues than would a decision to issue a summons by the Court or the conduct of the proceeding itself (cf McHugh J in Johns v Australian Securities Commission 178 CLR at 473 474 and see Re Excel 52 FCR at 83 84 and 86). It is difficult to see how failure to accord natural justice in relation to the decision in question could be cured by later events. In the second place, the examination procedure is not designed to accord natural justice to a party in relation to any allegations made, directly or indirectly, against the examinee. The process is inquisitorial rather than adversarial. There is no case put against the examinee or any case in reply. As Windeyer J said in Rees v Kratzmann (114 CLR at 80): \\n \\n 'The honest conduct of the affairs of companies is a matter of great public concern to-day. If the legislature thinks that in this field the public interest overcomes some of the common law's traditional consideration for the individual, then effect must be given to the statute which embodies this policy.' \\n \\n\\n(See also Hamilton v Oades [1989] HCA 21 ; (1989) 166 CLR 486.) The fact that the Court maintains considerable control over the examination does not change the information gathering nature of the function being performed. The analogy with the institution of Court proceedings is not apt.\",\"11\":\"Counsel for ASIC submitted that the decision of Sheppard J in Hare v Gladwin (1988) 82 ALR 307 is in point and should be followed. Section 316 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Cth) provided, inter alia, that an authorised officer of the Electoral Commission could issue a notice requiring the production of documents where the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that a person is capable of providing documents relating to a possible contravention of certain parts of the Act. Sheppard J held that the officer was not obliged to give a recipient an opportunity of making submissions as to why the notice should not be served or why it should be limited in a particular respect, nor to foreshadow to the recipient the nature of her belief in relation to a possible contravention of the Act. His Honour said (82 ALR at 330): \\n \\n 'She was acting in an investigatory capacity only. Nothing that she could do could affect any right or interest which he has or expose him, except by the operation of the Act itself, to conviction for any offence or the risk of such a conviction. In the light of the decision in Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550; 62 ALR 321, it is probably true to say that few statutes will be construed in such a manner as to deny to persons affected by action taken under them procedural fairness. The question in each case is what does procedural fairness require. In my opinion, it did not require Mrs Gladwin to give Mr Hare any opportunity of making any submissions to her at all about whether the notice should be issued or what the form of it ought to be.' \\n \\n\\nThat case is not on all fours with this case. On the one hand, it is a stronger case. The effect upon the recipient of the notice was direct and immediate rather than indirect. The right to maintain the privacy of documents was directly affected. On the other hand, there was no reference to damage to reputation, as public disclosure was apparently not involved. However, on the whole, it tends to support ASIC's position.\",\"12\":\"The private examination of persons pursuant to Div 2 of Pt 3 of the ASIC Act in aid of an investigation by ASIC pursuant to Div 1 of Pt 3 has a different history, role and purpose from examinations pursuant to Div 1 of Pt 5.9 of the Corporations Act . The latter are a long standing feature of insolvency administration, the history, nature and purpose of which have been analysed in many cases most recently by Lander J in Evans v Wainter Pty Limited [2005] FCAFC 114 ; (2005) 145 FCR 176 and French J in Highstoke Pty Ltd v Hayes Knight GTO Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 13 and need not be repeated.\\n\\nIt is also submitted that the common law right to maintain silence will be encroached upon. It is not clear to me that the so called common law right to silence is a right or interest in the sense outlined in Annetts v McCann [1990] HCA 57 ; 170 CLR 596 . The only authority that was cited to support that proposition, apart from the reference in the passage from the reasons of Dawson J in Johns v Australian Securities Commission 178 CLR at 437, was that of Branson J in Re Cortaus Ltd (in liq); Sheahan v Joye (No 2) (1996) 20 ACSR 576 at 578.

Dawson J (178 CLR at 437) expressly referred to personal reputation as being a sufficient interest to require observance of the rules of natural justice concerning a decision by the predecessor of ASIC to release confidential transcripts to a Royal Commission and consent to the use of them in public hearings. McHugh J used words to the same effect (178 CLR at 470 471) and Brennan J was impliedly to the same effect (178 CLR at 430). Gaudron J agreed with Brennan J. Dawson J referred to another factor in the following words (178 CLR at 437): \\n \\n '... the publication of the information provided by the appellant under compulsion was a further encroachment upon the appellant's common law right to maintain his silence upon the matters which were the subject of investigation by the A.S.C.'\\n\\nIt is submitted on behalf of the Administrators that the conduct of the examinations that are proposed is likely to prejudice their private and commercial and business reputation. It is a reasonable assumption that the examinations will be held in public and that the topics to be explored will involve airing allegations which would be detrimental to the reputation of the Administrators. It is also likely that there will be some media publicity as to those allegations.\\n\\nIt is also submitted that the common law right to maintain silence will be encroached upon. It is not clear to me that the so called common law right to silence is a right or interest in the sense outlined in Annetts v McCann [1990] HCA 57 ; 170 CLR 596 .

The issue of substance before the High Court concerned the validity of decisions on the part of the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) to release transcripts of private examinations of Johns by the ASC to a Royal Commission in circumstances which allowed the information released to be published generally (see 178 CLR at 421). The Australian Securities Commission Act 1989 (Cth) provided for the examination of persons on oath as ancillary to an investigation by the ASC. Such an examination was to take place in private (s 19). As Brennan J said, in delivering the principal judgment, (178 CLR at 422): \\n \\n 'The Act thus maintains the traditional privacy of examinations into the affairs of a company. Privacy has been observed in conducting such examinations out of consideration for the commercial reputation of the company and the protection of witnesses.' \\n \\n\\nOf course his Honour was not speaking of examinations pursuant to Pt 5 of the Corporations Act in relation to which public examination is now the norm. His Honour was of the view that confidentiality of the information contained in the transcripts of examination was amenable to protection by Johns by injunction where its use or disclosure was not authorised by statute (178 CLR at 427). That being the case, it was not a long step to hold that the statute implicitly provided that Johns was entitled to prior notice of any decision to affect his statutory right to confidentiality in the information in particular existing transcripts by authorising the release of those transcripts on a basis that would destroy that confidentiality.\\n\\nFor the sake of completeness I should deal with two arguments raised on behalf of ASIC, each of which I would reject if I had been of a different view concerning the duty to accord natural justice. The first was that the decision here was a step or stage in a process, the end result of which would entail procedural fairness ( Ainsworth per Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ 175 CLR at 578; South Australia v O'Shea [1987] HCA 39 ; (1987) 163 CLR 378 per Mason CJ at 389). It was argued that the position was not dissimilar to the lack of any requirement to afford a hearing prior to the commencement of a prosecution of a like proceeding ( Barton v The Queen [1980] HCA 48 ; (1980) 147 CLR 75 at 95; Cornall v AB (A Solicitor) [1995] 1 VR 372 at 396 397; Commissioner of Police v Reid 16 NSWLR at 461; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Plymin (No 3) [2002] VSC 358 ; (2002) 170 FLR 128 at 135 136).

The right to maintain the privacy of documents was directly affected. On the other hand, there was no reference to damage to reputation, as public disclosure was apparently not involved. However, on the whole, it tends to support ASIC's position.\\n\\nCounsel for ASIC pointed out that a similar question would arise in relation to the issue of a subpoena to produce documents or give evidence in a court established by statute. The same question would apply to the issue of a summons to give evidence or produce documents to a Royal Commission or other administrative body with compulsory powers, eg, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. There is a plethora of provisions that do not involve a hearing, but result in the compulsory acquisition of information and documents that can be used publicly later by the regulatory authority concerned, eg, notices pursuant to s 155 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and s 263 and s 264 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth), search warrants pursuant to Pt 1AA Div 2 of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) and telephone interception warrants pursuant to the Telecommunications (Interception) and Listening Device Amendment Act 1997 (Cth). Counsel for the Administrators was not able to cite any authority that has imposed a duty to hear any person before exercising any such powers, notwithstanding the expansion of the application of natural justice since Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550. I have already noted that no authority was cited to suggest that either the authorisation of an eligible applicant or the issue of a summons for examination has previously been challenged on this basis.\",\"15\":\"The reasons in Rio Tinto 151 FCR from [64] [68] make clear that it was a special case, depending upon the form of particulars given by the Commissioner. In my opinion, an argumentative submission that is responsive to an integer of the applicant's case and defensive of the respondent's position would not normally give rise to the type of inconsistency referred to by the High Court in Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1999) 201 CLR 1 and applied on the facts of Rio Tinto [2006] FCAFC 86 ; 151 FCR 341 (cf Bennett v Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Customs Service [2004] FCAFC 237 ; (2004) 140 FCR 101). I could see no special feature of the present case to displace that position.\",\"16\":\"It seems to me that par 15 and par 16 state the outcome with sufficient clarity. The use which is sought to be made of par [23] is a good example of the tendency to parse and analyse administrative reports with a fine toothcomb contrary to Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259. A fair reading of the three paragraphs in question is that the complexity of the matter was such that the fact that ASIC had come to a particular conclusion did not preclude a different conclusion being arrived at by others, particularly with the benefit of the further examinations sought. In my opinion, the decision maker was not obliged to seek any further information. It needs to be borne steadily in mind that an unconstrained discretion was being exercised.\\n\\nThere is a further difficulty with this argument. If the decision maker had drilled down to the Spear Report and the incorporated report it would have been apparent that the decision made by ASIC was based upon a number of debateable matters requiring judgment and that, indeed, the possibility of various forms of civil action were flagged but not precluded.\\n\\nThe second way in which par 23 was attacked was that the reasoning was perverse and therefore unreasonable in the Wednesbury sense. It was said that complexity of itself provides no sensible basis for departing from the prior conclusion by ASIC itself. A matter could be complex but the outcome clear. The way in which I have held that par 23 should be understood was not unreasonable in any sense. There is, therefore, no need to explore the application of the Wednesbury principle in this context.\",\"17\":\"The attack was twofold. In the first place, it was said that the decision maker was obliged to seek more information to clarify par 23 ( Prasad v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1985) 6 FCR 155 at 170 and other authorities which have applied Prasad ). It was suggested that the decision maker would need to drill down to ascertain upon what basis the decisions had been made and ascertain how clearly or strongly the conclusion had been reached and so on.\",\"18\":\"This argument ignores the difference between the two stages of the process and assumes that it was mandatory for ASIC to form a view that successful litigation on behalf of Allstate would ensue. In the first place, there is no mandatory consideration of that kind in the statute. Secondly, it mistakes the nature of examinations. They are for the purpose of information gathering. The potential result would only be known at the conclusion of that exercise rather than at the beginning. Thirdly, it assumes that the only potential causes of action were those expressly dealt with by ASIC and that the only examinations proposed were those of the listed persons. That was not the basis of the application and was not the basis of the approval. Fourthly, it ignores the more general purposes of public examination of those connected with insolvent companies ( Rees v Kratzmann [1965] HCA 49 ; (1965) 114 CLR 63).\\n\\nIt is also submitted that the common law right to maintain silence will be encroached upon. It is not clear to me that the so called common law right to silence is a right or interest in the sense outlined in Annetts v McCann [1990] HCA 57 ; 170 CLR 596 . The only authority that was cited to support that proposition, apart from the reference in the passage from the reasons of Dawson J in Johns v Australian Securities Commission 178 CLR at 437, was that of Branson J in Re Cortaus Ltd (in liq); Sheahan v Joye (No 2) (1996) 20 ACSR 576 at 578. That was an examination of the balance of convenience on an application for a contested adjournment and did not involve the present issue. There is merit in the submission by counsel for ASIC that it is hardly correct to say that an officer of a company that is in external administration has any right to silence concerning the affairs of the company.

It was argued that the position was not dissimilar to the lack of any requirement to afford a hearing prior to the commencement of a prosecution of a like proceeding ( Barton v The Queen [1980] HCA 48 ; (1980) 147 CLR 75 at 95; Cornall v AB (A Solicitor) [1995] 1 VR 372 at 396 397; Commissioner of Police v Reid 16 NSWLR at 461; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Plymin (No 3) [2002] VSC 358 ; (2002) 170 FLR 128 at 135 136).

A particular complaint is that this caused no attention to be paid to the mandatory nature of s 596A. It will be recalled that par 19(b) and par 19(c) of the Gray memorandum were in the following terms: \\n \\n \\n '(b) Different matters arise for consideration at each stage of the two stage process. The first stage requires ASIC to consider the relationship which the applicant has to the corporation, and may also include matters personal to the applicant, such as the applicant's relationship to the person to be examined. The second stage requires the Court, in deciding whether to grant the examination order, to take into account different matters including the relationship between the examinee and the corporation as well as relationship between the applicant and the examinee. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n (c) Contributories (including members) are a class of persons that would normally have the appropriate connection to the company to be an appropriate person to be authorised by ASIC.'\\n\\nIt is argued that, as a result, ASIC did not take into account a relevant consideration namely the current form of the statute, did take into account an irrelevant consideration, namely the former provision, and made an error of law.\\n\\nIn my opinion, the point which is made, whilst correct insofar as it goes, does not affect the validity of the reasoning adopted. The discussion by Gummow, Hill and Cooper JJ in Re Excel 52 FCR between 79 and 88 explains the difference between the authorisation decision, on the one hand, and the issue of the summons on the other and puts the issue in its historical context. Their Honours said (52 FCR at 83 84): \\n \\n 'What subs (1) does, in its reference to authorisation, is permit the Commission to extend the class of persons who may, in a particular case, have standing through the grant by the Commission of authorisation. The Commission, in determining whether to grant authorisation, will consider the relationship which the person seeking authorisation has to the relevant corporation and the external management of that corporation which is in progress. Contributories and creditors would normally have the appropriate connection with the corporation (as the history of examination orders, already set out, demonstrates), although other factors relevant to a particular case may make the authorisation of such persons inappropriate.' \\n \\n\\nAnd their Honours said (52 FCR at 86):\\n \\n 'But while the purpose of examinations ordered to take place under s 597(3) may be so stated, the role to be played by the procedure of authorisation contained in subs (1) is much narrower. It is to the subject matter, scope and purpose of subs (1) to which attention must be given to resolve the present question, not the subject matter, scope and purpose of subs (3). \\n \\n As we have already noted, the grant of authorisation under subs (1) does no more than confer standing upon the person authorised to make an application. That being the case, reference to the subject matter, scope and purpose of subs (1) leads to the conclusion that the decision-maker, in determining whether to authorise a particular person to make applications in relation to a particular corporation, will be required only to consider the relationship which that person has to the external administration and in a particular case the appropriateness of that person being given standing to apply to the Court under subs (2).'\\n\\nIn my respectful opinion, those statements remain apposite notwithstanding the amendments to the provisions. The two stage process remains and there is nothing about the amendments which renders inappropriate the explanation of the proper approach to the first stage. It should be noted that historically any contributory could apply for an examination order.\\n\\nFurthermore, the relevant parts of the Gray memorandum refer to the authorities relevant to the new provisions and expressly refer to the new provisions themselves. It can be assumed that the decision maker, Taylor, was familiar with the statutory provisions. He was, after all, the delegate of ASIC.\\n\\nThe question is whether the decision in question prejudiced the rights of the Administrators. There is some debate as to whether the relevant power being exercised is that conferred by s 11(4) of the ASIC Act or the substantive provisions of the Corporations Act . The better view in this Court is the former ( Re Excel 52 FCR at 82). Whether the correct answer is either or both is of little significance for the resolution of the present issue. The power is unconstrained by any express provision and the only effect of the impugned decision is to put the appointee in a position to apply for a summons pursuant to s 596A and s 596B of the Corporations Act as an eligible applicant. That appointment has no effect upon any other person. The interests of other persons are not affected unless and until a summons is issued. The focus upon the Administrators in this case tends to distort perspective. It does not even follow that the issue of a summons for examination and the conduct of the examination will have an adverse impact upon all potential examinees. An examinee may be asked to give an account of what occurred in the affairs of the company without any reflection upon the examinee or the disclosure of any information personal to the examinee. Examinations may be conducted in order to obtain information without any defined target and, even if there is a defined target, many examinees will not be that target. Given the width of s 596A and s 596B , it is apparent that it would be quite impractical to give notice to all persons who might be conceivably affected by the appointment of a person as an eligible applicant in relation to the affairs of a particular corporation either as a potential examinee or a person potentially affected by evidence to be given by an examinee.\\n\\nIn the present case it may be accepted that, at the time the decision was made, the Administrators had been identified as both targets and examinees. Thus, in a practical sense, a grant of the status of eligible applicant was a step towards an examination which was either inevitable or highly likely. In my opinion, that practical consequence does not mean that the difference between the stages explained in Re Excel 52 FCR 69 can be elided. In Ainsworth Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ said (175 CLR at 576): \\n \\n '... what is decisive is the nature of the power, not the character of the proceeding which attends its exercise.' \\n \\n\\nEither the statutory power is subject to the obligation to afford prior notice or it is not. The circumstances of the particular application for exercise of the power do not affect the question as to whether the implied obligation has any operation in relation to the power in question. The decision to authorise the Evans did not itself directly adversely affect the interests of others in the manner required to bring the statutory presumption into play.\\n\\nFor the sake of completeness I should deal with two arguments raised on behalf of ASIC, each of which I would reject if I had been of a different view concerning the duty to accord natural justice. The first was that the decision here was a step or stage in a process, the end result of which would entail procedural fairness ( Ainsworth per Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ 175 CLR at 578; South Australia v O'Shea [1987] HCA 39 ; (1987) 163 CLR 378 per Mason CJ at 389). It was argued that the position was not dissimilar to the lack of any requirement to afford a hearing prior to the commencement of a prosecution of a like proceeding ( Barton v The Queen [1980] HCA 48 ; (1980) 147 CLR 75 at 95; Cornall v AB (A Solicitor) [1995] 1 VR 372 at 396 397; Commissioner of Police v Reid 16 NSWLR at 461; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Plymin (No 3) [2002] VSC 358 ; (2002) 170 FLR 128 at 135 136). In the first place, it is doubtful whether there is a single decision making process of the kind referred to in the present circumstances. The decision by ASIC in relation to authorisation involves different questions and different issues than would a decision to issue a summons by the Court or the conduct of the proceeding itself (cf McHugh J in Johns v Australian Securities Commission 178 CLR at 473 474 and see Re Excel 52 FCR at 83 84 and 86). It is difficult to see how failure to accord natural justice in relation to the decision in question could be cured by later events. In the second place, the examination procedure is not designed to accord natural justice to a party in relation to any allegations made, directly or indirectly, against the examinee. The process is inquisitorial rather than adversarial. There is no case put against the examinee or any case in reply. As Windeyer J said in Rees v Kratzmann (114 CLR at 80): \\n \\n 'The honest conduct of the affairs of companies is a matter of great public concern to-day. If the legislature thinks that in this field the public interest overcomes some of the common law's traditional consideration for the individual, then effect must be given to the statute which embodies this policy.' \\n \\n\\n(See also Hamilton v Oades [1989] HCA 21 ; (1989) 166 CLR 486.) The fact that the Court maintains considerable control over the examination does not change the information gathering nature of the function being performed. The analogy with the institution of Court proceedings is not apt.\",\"21\":\"The place of so called 'legitimate expectation' in administrative law has always been controversial. It was considered most recently by the High Court in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; Ex parte Lam [2003] HCA 6 ; (2003) 214 CLR 1 per Gleeson CJ at [26] [38]; per McHugh and Gummow JJ at [47] [49], [61] [83] and [103] [106]; per Hayne J at [116] [122]; per Callinan J at [140] [148]. In my opinion, that discussion is inconsistent with the features in the dealings between the parties here that were identified as giving rise to or creating an obligation to give notice to the Administrators before exercising the statutory power in question.\\n\\nI should add that the ASIC publication concerning natural justice (Australian Securities and Investments Commission, Policy Statement 92: Procedural Fairness to Third Parties, Australian Securities and Investments Commission , Canberra, 1995) does no more than purport to give effect to the requirements of the law.\",\"22\":\"For the sake of completeness I should deal with two arguments raised on behalf of ASIC, each of which I would reject if I had been of a different view concerning the duty to accord natural justice.

It was submitted that ASIC had received significant submissions from or on behalf of the Administrators in relation to the original investigation and in relation to the release of transcripts which said all that could be said, as was revealed by the nature of the response made when the authorisation was known. Counsel for ASIC submitted that the evidence suggested that ASIC took those considerations into account. Some of the difficulties of applying the Stead principle were discussed by McHugh, Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ in Applicant NAFF of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] HCA 62 ; (2004) 221 CLR 1 at [34] . In the present case, the question was whether particular persons should be appointed as eligible applicants. I can see no evidence that that topic was addressed in the submissions made on behalf of the Administrators prior to the decision being made.\",\"24\":\"Ainsworth [1992] HCA 10 ; 175 CLR 564 concerned publication of a damning report. The same can be said of Testro Bros Pty Ltd v Tait [1963] HCA 29 ; (1963) 109 CLR 353 that was effectively overruled by Annetts v McCann (per Mason CJ, Dean and McHugh JJ 170 CLR at 598) and Ainsworth (per Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ 175 CLR at 576 577).\"}}"
