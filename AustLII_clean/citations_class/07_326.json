In each case the court emphasised the proposition that the task of the Minister, through his delegate, and the Refugee Review Tribunal on appeal, pursuant to s 65 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth), is to consider whether they are satisfied that the requirements for the grant of a visa have been satisfied.
