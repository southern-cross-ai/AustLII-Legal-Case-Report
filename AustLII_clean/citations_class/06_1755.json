That pursuant to Federal Magistrates Court Rule 19.02(1) the Respondent be found guilty of contempt of this Court for failing to comply with the order for discovery made by this Court on 1 July 2004 in that it did not discover the full chain of email correspondence dated 4 December 2001 variously between the Applicant and Ms Leesa Baker and then Ms Baker and Ms Hall and Ms Lindsay.' \\n \\n \\n \\n FACTS \\n \\n 3 Because of the manner in which the Federal Magistrate decided the case, he did not need to set out a chronology of events. It is best to do so in order to deal with the issues on appeal. The following statement of facts is substantially drawn from the submissions for the appellant. I am satisfied the facts are properly based in the evidence. It needs to be borne in mind that it was only the appellant's evidence which was relevant. The appellant was entitled to have that evidence considered at its highest ( May v O'Sullivan [1955] HCA 38 ; (1955) 92 CLR 654; Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd v Marsden [2001] NSWCA 32 ; (2001) 122 A Crim R 166 per Ipp AJA at 172 176). I shall discuss some of the evidence in more detail when considering the individual charges. \\n 4 The appellant commenced full-time employment with the respondent as an accountant on 15 December 1997. In December 1998 the appellant was promoted to financial controller and received substantial pay increases during 1999 and 2000. In May 2000 the appellant married. In November 2000 the appellant became pregnant and in August 2001 gave birth to her son. In November 2001, during her maternity leave, the appellant met with Mr Stephen Byron, the respondent's Managing Director, and indicated that she would like to return to work in February 2002 on a part-time basis. Whilst Mr Byron said he would consider her request, the appellant was uneasy about the way in which he treated her; she generally considered that he had been evasive and was unlikely to accede to her request.\",\"1\":\"26 The other two charges are different in nature as they involve alleged breaches of orders ( cf Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union and Others v Mudginberri Station Proprietary Limited [1986] HCA 46 ; (1986) 161 CLR 98).\\n\\n27 The subpoena in question was issued on 12 February 2004 directing the respondent to produce the documents on 26 February 2004 in the form described in paragraph [ 11 ] of these reasons. The full email chain containing six separate emails dated 4 December 2001 was not produced, although two of those six emails were produced.\\n\\n28 The Federal Magistrate found that there was no prima facie case for the respondent to answer as the subpoena called for material from the server, not from the back-up tapes. He said that there was no evidence that the email chain in question was on the respondent's server at the relevant time. He was not prepared to infer that the full email chain was still on the server in February 2004.\",\"2\":\"23 This is a circumstantial case. The Federal Magistrate was required to take into account all inferences most favourable to the appellant, which could reasonably be drawn from the primary facts (see the decision of the Privy Council in Haw Tua Tau v Public Prosecutor [1982] AC 136 at 150). In my opinion, it would not be possible, on the primary facts, to exclude the hypothesis that any destruction of the emails that took place was the result of actions by persons with no knowledge of the proceedings or potential proceedings or was a result of a procedure which did not take account of those proceedings. It is quite possible that a system could have existed which provided for the destruction of emails at fixed times during the year, at a particular length of time after an employee has left or as directed by some person in the administration or technology areas to suit the convenience of administration. In other words, any destruction may have been the result of a routine procedure. There is no inference available from the primary facts that would exclude that hypothesis unless there is speculation as to the circumstances of the alleged destruction.\\n\\n24 Counsel for the appellant referred to the evidence of Mr Ferraro that it was not usual commercial practice to delete a former employee's email mailbox if that employee had played an important role in the organisation. Even if that evidence were admissible, it would not say anything about the commercial practices of this respondent and would not assist in denying the hypotheses to which I have referred.\",\"3\":\"25 This analysis is a symptom of what appears to me to be an underlying problem, namely, that the party charged with interfering with the course of justice is a corporation with a number of employees carrying out a number of functions. The principles according to which a corporation can be guilty of contempt of court by interfering with the course of justice were not a topic raised below and only surfaced during the course of argument on this appeal. Even if a corporation can be guilty of such a charge, it is not legitimate to aggregate the knowledge of individuals and attribute the aggregated knowledge to the corporation ( R v AC Hatrick Chemicals Pty Ltd (1995) 152 A Crim R 384 at 394; cf, in a different context, Krakowski v Eurolynx Properties Ltd [1994] HCA 22 ; (1995) 183 CLR 563 at 582 583). In the present case, it is not possible to know who deleted the emails (that is if they were deleted) or on whose instructions the emails were deleted. That being the case, it is not possible to attribute to those persons the knowledge held by others within the organisation as to the actual or potential litigation. The relevant knowledge as to the litigation would have to be held by the representative of the corporation who was also responsible for the deletion. Further, that person would need to be the directing mind of the corporation for guilt of such a charge--in effect, a common law offence requiring mens rea--being attributed to the company ( Tesco Supermarkets Ltd v Nattrass [1971] UKHL 1 ; [1972] AC 153). The evidence in this case simply does not permit any such finding to be made.\",\"4\":\"4.
