According to the High Court in R v Hibble; Ex parte Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd [1920] HCA 83 ; (1920) 28 CLR 456, 463, the test for the issue of prohibition is not whether the inferior court is functus officio or whether its order can no longer be enforced.

When a plaintiff claims a sum by way of damages which is greater than the sum which a court of inferior jurisdiction is entitled to award, the case should not be transferred to the inferior court unless, perhaps, it is quite clear that the amount claimed will not be recovered. Indeed, where an action is commenced in an inferior court and it appears to that court that the damages which a plaintiff seeks exceed the limit which the inferior court is able to award, it is the duty of that court to transfer the case to a court of competent jurisdiction. Here it is true that the prosecutrix had not stated definitely that her claim exceeded $200,000. It was, I suppose, possible that she may have limited her claim to one that could be entertained by the Federal Magistrates Court. But that possibility was so remote that the action should not have been transferred. Nothing said in Colac Otway Workforce Pty Ltd v Dwyer [2005] VSCA 230 is inconsistent with this view.\",\"3\":\"5 When the action was transferred to the Federal Magistrates Court the statement of claim (which had already been twice amended) did not plead a contravention of s 51AB.
