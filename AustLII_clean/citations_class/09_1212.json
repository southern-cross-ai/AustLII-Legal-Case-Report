The plaintiffs submit that s 479 and s 511 perform similar functions citing Dean-Willcocks v Soluble Solution Hydroponics Pty Ltd (1997) 42 NSWLR 209 at 212.

This is a claim for restitution of an amount wrongly paid which is capable of constituting a \\\"debt\\\".

The fact that the major creditors of EBD have had the opportunity to consider the proposed settlement, and do not oppose it, is also important. So too is the fact that EBD's liquidators have a limited opportunity to choose between the prospect of pursuing a novel application and the certainty of a settlement.\\n\\nFor all these reasons the compromise constituted by the Settlement Deed should be approved pursuant to s 477(2A) of the Act. There should also be a direction that the liquidators of EBD are justified in entering into the Settlement Deed. The order and direction are intended to meet the conditions precedent under clause 2 of the Settlement Deed. \\n I certify that the preceding twenty (20) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gilmour. \\n \\n Associate:\\n \\n \\nDated: 27 October 2009\\n \\n Counsel for the Plaintiff: Mr J A Thomson \\n \\n Solicitor for the Plaintiff: Mallesons Stephen Jaques \\n \\n Counsel for the Defendant: Ms W Gillan \\n \\n Solicitor for the Defendant: DLA Phillips Fox \\n Date of Hearing: 15 October 2009 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 27 October 2009 \\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2009\\/1212.html\"}}"
