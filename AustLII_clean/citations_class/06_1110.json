The finding that there was no real chance of future persecution was open on the evidence. I can see no jurisdictional error in the finding. Accordingly, the appeal should be dismissed with costs. \\n\\n\\n I certify that the preceding thirty-six (36) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Cowdroy. \\n\\n\\n Associate:\\n\\nDated: 22 August 2006\\n\\n\\n Counsel for the Appellant: The appellant appeared in person, with the assistance of his friend Mr Sarkis. \\n \\n Counsel for the Respondent: Ms S McNaughton \\n \\n Solicitor for the Respondent: Blake Dawson Waldron \\n \\n Date of Hearing: 7 August 2006 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 22 August 2006 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2006\\/1110.html\",\"1\":\"31 The question, therefore, is whether, as Smith FM suggests, the decision of the Tribunal can be sustained because there is a separate and independent line of reasoning which is not affected by the breach of s 424A(1): see SZECD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 31 ; (2006) 150 FCR 53.\\n\\n32 The finding of the Tribunal relied upon by Smith FM states as follows: \\n \\n \\n 'In any event, even if I am wrong in relation to these findings, I am satisfied that given that the applicant has now been discharged from the LAF, there is no prospect that this mistreatment would continue if he were to return to Lebanon. I do not accept the applicant's evidence that his relative the colonel advised him to leave Lebanon once he was demobilised. There is no sensible reason arising from the evidence before me to suggest that the applicant would be at risk of any continuing harm or human rights violations arising from his military service once that service had ended. Whatever ill treatment he may have encountered during that period, I am satisfied that there is no real chance that it would continue in the future.'\\n\\n33 I accept that this is a separate and independent line of reasoning as discussed in SZECD and that, if this finding is unaffected by jurisdictional error, the decision of the Tribunal can be sustained. Accordingly, the question is whether this finding is free from jurisdictional error.\\n\\n34 I consider that it was open to the Tribunal to find that there was no real chance that the appellant would be subject to mistreatment if he were to return to Lebanon because he had been discharged from the military, even given the possibility that the appellant might be called up for reservist duty. The Tribunal was clearly aware of this possibility. It recorded in its reasons the fact that the appellant is a reservist, noting: \\n \\n \\n 'The applicant submitted copies and translations of his military service exemption card, issued in January 2003, stating that the applicant had completed more than two years service in the armed forces and was free to travel overseas, among other things; his army reservist card, indicating that he is eligible for reservist duty at first level until 2007, and at second level until 2017 ...'\\n\\n35 The Tribunal's reasons also record that the appellant specifically raised the matter of his reservist status, noting that the appellant claimed: \\n \\n \\n 'Also, because he is a reservist, if a war breaks out he will have to fight; he does not want to fight because he does not want to hurt anyone, and they will put Christians in the front line.'\"}}"
