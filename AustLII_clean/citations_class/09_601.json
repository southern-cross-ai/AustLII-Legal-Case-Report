Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ there made the following observations in relation to the powers of a Court when entertaining an appeal by way of a rehearing (references omitted): \\n For present purposes, the critical difference between an appeal by way of rehearing and a hearing de novo is that, in the former case, the powers of the appellate court are exercisable only where the appellant can demonstrate that, having regard to all the evidence now before the appellate court, the order that is the subject of the appeal is the result of some legal, factual or discretionary error, whereas, in the latter case, those powers may be exercised regardless of error. At least that is so unless, in the case of an appeal by way of rehearing, there is some statutory provision which indicates that the powers may be exercised whether or not there was error at first instance. And the critical distinction, for present purposes, between an appeal by way of rehearing and an appeal in the strict sense is that, unless the matter is remitted for rehearing, a court hearing an appeal in the strict sense can only give the decision which should have been given at first instance whereas, on an appeal by way of rehearing, an appellate court can substitute its own decision based on the facts and the law as they then stand. \\n\\n \\nAlthough this was a case concerning the Family Court, s 27 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) is not materially different to the equivalent provision of the Family Law Act 1976 (Cth): Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia Legeng [2001] HCA 17 at [75] , [2001] HCA 17 ; 205 CLR 507 at 533 per Gleeson CJ and Gummow J.

And in Elyard Corporation Pty Ltd v DDB Needham Sydney Pty Ltd (1995) 61 FCR 385 consideration was given to whether that statutory requirement displaced the \\\" slip rule \\\". That decision has since been applied in the context of bankruptcy proceedings in Griffiths v Boral Resources (Qld) Pty Ltd [2006] FCAFC 149 , 154 FCR 554. Spender ACJ, Dowsett and Collier JJ there observed as follows: \\n [29] The decision of the Full Court in Re Young; ex parte Smith (1985) 5 FCR 204 establishes that there can be no extension pursuant to s 52 of the Bankruptcy Act once the petition has lapsed. However the Court (of which Lockhart J was a member) considered that there was no question of applying the slip rule in that case (at 209). In Elyard the Court addressed the slip rule, but in the context of winding up rather than bankruptcy. Although s 52 of the Bankruptcy Act serves substantially the same purpose as s 459R of the Corporations Act , there are potentially significant differences between the two sections. \\n\\n \\n [30] With all respect, we are a little uncomfortable with the view, inherent in Elyard , that the slip rule may be used to extend time notwithstanding the statutory requirement that such order be made within a period of time which has elapsed. However Elyard concerns the practice of the Court and has now stood for over ten years without legislative intervention. We are reluctant to reconsider it. Although it does not directly bind us in applying s 52 of the Bankruptcy Act , to take a different approach would cause substantial confusion in insolvency practice. \\n\\n \\n [31] We wish to stress, however, the importance of the policy, evidenced in both the Corporations Act and the Bankruptcy Act , that insolvency proceedings be speedily resolved, presumably for commercial reasons and for reasons of fairness. Courts exercising jurisdiction in insolvency must recognise this policy by giving priority to the hearing and determination of such matters. The parties and their legal advisers, particularly those advising petitioning creditors, must be aware of the potential problem. The decision in Elyard should not be taken as establishing an unlimited power to avoid this statutory policy. \\n\\n \\n As also noted by their Honours, the question as to whether there was any \\\" error \\\" which attracted the power to invoke the \\\" slip rule \\\" is a question of fact: [2006] FCAFC 149 at [68] . With respect, the same reservation is also expressed as to ability to correct an \\\" error \\\" pursuant to O 35 r 7 by extending the duration of a petition in the face of the express statutory terms of s 52(5). Notwithstanding that reservation, it is the case that other authorities have endorsed the existence of a power to extend time after the initial 12 month period has expired and where there has been an accidental slip or omission in failing to make an application within the time prescribed by s 52(5): Matthews v Collett [2000] FCA 224 ; Bankstown Grammar School Ltd v Park [2000] FCA 1205 ; Roskell v Snelgrove [2008] FCA 427 , 246 ALR 175 ; Boumelhem v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2008] FCA 1568 , 171 FCR 462.\",\"3\":\"There was no dissent from the proposition that the Court has an implied jurisdiction to set aside a bankruptcy notice as an abuse of process: Re Sterling; Ex parte Esanda Ltd [1980] FCA 61 ; (1980) 44 FLR 125. And an abuse of process may be made out if the purpose in issuing the bankruptcy notice is to put pressure on a debtor to pay the debt rather than to invoke the Court's jurisdiction in relation to insolvency: Brunninghausen v Glavanics [1998] FCA 230. In Killoran v Duncan [1999] FCA 1574 , Gyles J thus observed: \\n [12] Whilst there is no debate about the jurisdiction of the Court to set aside a bankruptcy notice as an abuse of process where it can be concluded that it was simply to put pressure on the debtor rather than to genuinely invoke the Court's jurisdiction, I am not satisfied that that is the position here. There is nothing to indicate that the respondent creditor does not genuinely intend to pursue the matter if there is default in complying with the notice. In my opinion, there is nothing special about abuse of process in this field, and, if a person wishes to resort to the jurisdiction of the Court for appropriate orders, then it will be an unusual case in which that will be prevented. \\n\\n \\n [13] There is no evidence here of any collateral purpose or of any undue pressure being applied. It is correct, I think, that the time to judge abuse of process is the time that the bankruptcy notice is issued and that subsequent events have relatively slight relevance. They may be relevant insofar as they throw light upon circumstances which might have been appreciated and foreseen at the time of the issue of the notice. \\n\\n \\n [14] If, contrary to my view, however, there were a prima facie case of abuse of process, the remedy is discretionary and, in my view, if circumstances following that time had altered significantly so that it would not be appropriate to set aside the notice, I think that the jurisdiction of the Court is wide enough to give effect to that. I have in mind here that whilst the immediate parties to the application are those with the most interest in the matter, the body of creditors generally also have an interest and I cannot be certain one way or the other about the position of solvency. It may be most unfortunate if a bankruptcy notice were set aside in circumstances where the debtor is in fact insolvent. \\n\\n \\nBy way of example, in Maxwell-Smith v S & E Hall Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 825 , 233 ALR 81 Jacobson J was prepared to infer that the purpose in issuing a bankruptcy notice was to put pressure on the debtor rather than to genuinely invoke the court's bankruptcy jurisdiction in circumstances where the bankruptcy notice sought payment of a debt for a small amount based on a judgment debt which was over 5 years old; where the judgment creditor was aware of the probability of solvency; and where the judgment debtor owned assets which greatly exceeded the debt.

His Honour there set forth as follows his results of that analysis: \\n [12] These authorities establish a number of relevant propositions. They are: \\n\\n \\n(1) An order can be made under s 153B(1) of the Act notwithstanding that the applicant has been discharged from bankruptcy; Re Oates; ex parte Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1987) 17 FCR 402. \\n \\n(2) An applicant who seeks an annulment of his or her bankruptcy \\\"carries a heavy burden\\\". It is incumbent on an applicant \\\"to place before the Court all relevant material with respect to his or her financial affairs so that the Court may be properly informed and may make a judgment that is based on the actual circumstances of the applicant\\\": Re Papps; Ex parte Tapp (1997) 78 FCR 524 at 531.\\n \\n(3) In determining whether or not a sequestration order \\\"ought not to have been made\\\" the Court is not confined to a consideration of whether the order should have been made on the facts known to the Court at the time at which it was made. The Court must take account of facts, known at the time at which the sequestration order was made and at which it determines an annulment application, even if those facts were not before the Court at the time at which the sequestration order was made: Boles v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy [2001] FCA 639 ; (2001) 183 ALR 239 at 243; Re Raymond; ex parte Raymond (1992) 36 FCR 424 at 426.\\n \\n(4) A sequestration order \\\"ought not to have been made\\\" if, on the facts known at the time of the annulment application, the Court would have been bound not to make the sequestration order: Re Frank; ex parte Piliszky (1987) 16 FCR 396. \\n \\n(5) The Court will be so satisfied if it is established that the debtor was not, at the time the sequestration order was made, indebted to the petitioning creditor: Re Deriu (1970) 16 FLR 420 at 422.\\n \\n(6) If the Court is so satisfied, it is not precluded from annulling the bankruptcy because the bankrupt had not sought to have the default judgment set aside or failed to oppose the creditor's petition or failed to seek a review of the sequestration order: Re Raymond; ex parte Raymond (1992) 36 FCR 424 at 426.\\n \\n(7) The power conferred on the Court by s 153B(1) is discretionary in nature. Even if persuaded that the sequestration order ought not to have been made, the Court can, in appropriate circumstances, decline to annul the bankruptcy: Boles v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy [2001] FCA 639 ; (2001) 183 ALR 239 at 243.\\n \\n(8) Considerations which may have a bearing on the exercise of discretion include unexplained delay in the making of the application, whether or not the applicant is solvent, whether or not the applicant has made full disclosure of his or her financial affairs and a failure by the bankrupt to oppose the creditor's petition and attend the hearing at which the sequestration order was made: Re Williams (1968) 13 FLR 10 at 24 5; Boles at 247; Re Papps; ex parte Tapp (1997) 78 FCR 524 at 531; Rigg v Baker [2006] FCAFC 179 at [79]; Cottrell v Wilcox [2002] FCA 1115 at [7]. Additional considerations are collected in D. A. Hassall, \\\"Annulment of Bankruptcy and Review of Sequestration Orders\\\" (1993) 67 ALJ 761 at 766.\\n\\nThe task he was undertaking was the task entrusted to him by s 153B, namely the task of considering whether the sequestration order \\\" ought not to have been made \\\". Whether or not the Appellant appealed the making of the sequestration order is not of immediate relevance to the separate and discrete task entrusted by s 153B. An appeal from the making of a sequestration order is a separate process from an application under s 153B. One fundamental difference is that when undertaking the task of considering whether a sequestration order \\\" ought not to have been made \\\", the Court is not confined to a consideration of only that material which was before the person making the order. As Heinrich and Bulic make clear, \\\" the Court is not confined to a consideration of whether the order should have been made on the facts known to the Court at the time at which it was made. The Court must take account of facts, known at the time at which the sequestration order was made and at which it determines an annulment application, even if those facts were not before the Court at the time at which the sequestration order was made \\\". A further difference is the existence of the discretion conferred by s 153B.\",\"7\":\"There was no dissent from the proposition that the Court has an implied jurisdiction to set aside a bankruptcy notice as an abuse of process: Re Sterling; Ex parte Esanda Ltd [1980] FCA 61 ; (1980) 44 FLR 125.

It is correct, I think, that the time to judge abuse of process is the time that the bankruptcy notice is issued and that subsequent events have relatively slight relevance. They may be relevant insofar as they throw light upon circumstances which might have been appreciated and foreseen at the time of the issue of the notice. \\n\\n \\n [14] If, contrary to my view, however, there were a prima facie case of abuse of process, the remedy is discretionary and, in my view, if circumstances following that time had altered significantly so that it would not be appropriate to set aside the notice, I think that the jurisdiction of the Court is wide enough to give effect to that. I have in mind here that whilst the immediate parties to the application are those with the most interest in the matter, the body of creditors generally also have an interest and I cannot be certain one way or the other about the position of solvency. It may be most unfortunate if a bankruptcy notice were set aside in circumstances where the debtor is in fact insolvent. \\n\\n \\nBy way of example, in Maxwell-Smith v S & E Hall Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 825 , 233 ALR 81 Jacobson J was prepared to infer that the purpose in issuing a bankruptcy notice was to put pressure on the debtor rather than to genuinely invoke the court's bankruptcy jurisdiction in circumstances where the bankruptcy notice sought payment of a debt for a small amount based on a judgment debt which was over 5 years old; where the judgment creditor was aware of the probability of solvency; and where the judgment debtor owned assets which greatly exceeded the debt.

They are: \\n\\n \\n(1) An order can be made under s 153B(1) of the Act notwithstanding that the applicant has been discharged from bankruptcy; Re Oates; ex parte Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1987) 17 FCR 402. \\n \\n(2) An applicant who seeks an annulment of his or her bankruptcy \\\"carries a heavy burden\\\". It is incumbent on an applicant \\\"to place before the Court all relevant material with respect to his or her financial affairs so that the Court may be properly informed and may make a judgment that is based on the actual circumstances of the applicant\\\": Re Papps; Ex parte Tapp (1997) 78 FCR 524 at 531.\\n \\n(3) In determining whether or not a sequestration order \\\"ought not to have been made\\\" the Court is not confined to a consideration of whether the order should have been made on the facts known to the Court at the time at which it was made. The Court must take account of facts, known at the time at which the sequestration order was made and at which it determines an annulment application, even if those facts were not before the Court at the time at which the sequestration order was made: Boles v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy [2001] FCA 639 ; (2001) 183 ALR 239 at 243; Re Raymond; ex parte Raymond (1992) 36 FCR 424 at 426.\\n \\n(4) A sequestration order \\\"ought not to have been made\\\" if, on the facts known at the time of the annulment application, the Court would have been bound not to make the sequestration order: Re Frank; ex parte Piliszky (1987) 16 FCR 396. \\n \\n(5) The Court will be so satisfied if it is established that the debtor was not, at the time the sequestration order was made, indebted to the petitioning creditor: Re Deriu (1970) 16 FLR 420 at 422.\\n \\n(6) If the Court is so satisfied, it is not precluded from annulling the bankruptcy because the bankrupt had not sought to have the default judgment set aside or failed to oppose the creditor's petition or failed to seek a review of the sequestration order: Re Raymond; ex parte Raymond (1992) 36 FCR 424 at 426.\\n \\n(7) The power conferred on the Court by s 153B(1) is discretionary in nature. Even if persuaded that the sequestration order ought not to have been made, the Court can, in appropriate circumstances, decline to annul the bankruptcy: Boles v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy [2001] FCA 639 ; (2001) 183 ALR 239 at 243.\\n \\n(8) Considerations which may have a bearing on the exercise of discretion include unexplained delay in the making of the application, whether or not the applicant is solvent, whether or not the applicant has made full disclosure of his or her financial affairs and a failure by the bankrupt to oppose the creditor's petition and attend the hearing at which the sequestration order was made: Re Williams (1968) 13 FLR 10 at 24 5; Boles at 247; Re Papps; ex parte Tapp (1997) 78 FCR 524 at 531; Rigg v Baker [2006] FCAFC 179 at [79]; Cottrell v Wilcox [2002] FCA 1115 at [7].

Whether or not the Appellant appealed the making of the sequestration order is not of immediate relevance to the separate and discrete task entrusted by s 153B. An appeal from the making of a sequestration order is a separate process from an application under s 153B. One fundamental difference is that when undertaking the task of considering whether a sequestration order \\\" ought not to have been made \\\", the Court is not confined to a consideration of only that material which was before the person making the order. As Heinrich and Bulic make clear, \\\" the Court is not confined to a consideration of whether the order should have been made on the facts known to the Court at the time at which it was made. The Court must take account of facts, known at the time at which the sequestration order was made and at which it determines an annulment application, even if those facts were not before the Court at the time at which the sequestration order was made \\\".

It may further be assumed for present purposes that, albeit inadvertently, the Appellant was denied procedural fairness in both April and September 2008. The denial of procedural fairness in September 2008 may provide a basis upon which it could be contended that the sequestration order ought not to have been made. Indeed the present case provides an instance of the ability in an application made pursuant to s 153B to consider all of the \\\" true facts \\\" as at the date of the making of the sequestration order: Heinrich v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2003] FCAFC 315 at [20] . The Federal Magistrate may not have known why neither the Appellant nor her solicitor was present on 2 September.

And in Elyard Corporation Pty Ltd v DDB Needham Sydney Pty Ltd (1995) 61 FCR 385 consideration was given to whether that statutory requirement displaced the \\\" slip rule \\\". That decision has since been applied in the context of bankruptcy proceedings in Griffiths v Boral Resources (Qld) Pty Ltd [2006] FCAFC 149 , 154 FCR 554. Spender ACJ, Dowsett and Collier JJ there observed as follows: \\n [29] The decision of the Full Court in Re Young; ex parte Smith (1985) 5 FCR 204 establishes that there can be no extension pursuant to s 52 of the Bankruptcy Act once the petition has lapsed. However the Court (of which Lockhart J was a member) considered that there was no question of applying the slip rule in that case (at 209). In Elyard the Court addressed the slip rule, but in the context of winding up rather than bankruptcy. Although s 52 of the Bankruptcy Act serves substantially the same purpose as s 459R of the Corporations Act , there are potentially significant differences between the two sections. \\n\\n \\n [30] With all respect, we are a little uncomfortable with the view, inherent in Elyard , that the slip rule may be used to extend time notwithstanding the statutory requirement that such order be made within a period of time which has elapsed. However Elyard concerns the practice of the Court and has now stood for over ten years without legislative intervention. We are reluctant to reconsider it. Although it does not directly bind us in applying s 52 of the Bankruptcy Act , to take a different approach would cause substantial confusion in insolvency practice. \\n\\n \\n [31] We wish to stress, however, the importance of the policy, evidenced in both the Corporations Act and the Bankruptcy Act , that insolvency proceedings be speedily resolved, presumably for commercial reasons and for reasons of fairness. Courts exercising jurisdiction in insolvency must recognise this policy by giving priority to the hearing and determination of such matters. The parties and their legal advisers, particularly those advising petitioning creditors, must be aware of the potential problem. The decision in Elyard should not be taken as establishing an unlimited power to avoid this statutory policy. \\n\\n \\n As also noted by their Honours, the question as to whether there was any \\\" error \\\" which attracted the power to invoke the \\\" slip rule \\\" is a question of fact: [2006] FCAFC 149 at [68] . With respect, the same reservation is also expressed as to ability to correct an \\\" error \\\" pursuant to O 35 r 7 by extending the duration of a petition in the face of the express statutory terms of s 52(5). Notwithstanding that reservation, it is the case that other authorities have endorsed the existence of a power to extend time after the initial 12 month period has expired and where there has been an accidental slip or omission in failing to make an application within the time prescribed by s 52(5): Matthews v Collett [2000] FCA 224 ; Bankstown Grammar School Ltd v Park [2000] FCA 1205 ; Roskell v Snelgrove [2008] FCA 427 , 246 ALR 175 ; Boumelhem v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2008] FCA 1568 , 171 FCR 462.\",\"26\":\"There was no dissent from the proposition that the Court has an implied jurisdiction to set aside a bankruptcy notice as an abuse of process: Re Sterling; Ex parte Esanda Ltd [1980] FCA 61 ; (1980) 44 FLR 125.

Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ there made the following observations in relation to the powers of a Court when entertaining an appeal by way of a rehearing (references omitted): \\n For present purposes, the critical difference between an appeal by way of rehearing and a hearing de novo is that, in the former case, the powers of the appellate court are exercisable only where the appellant can demonstrate that, having regard to all the evidence now before the appellate court, the order that is the subject of the appeal is the result of some legal, factual or discretionary error, whereas, in the latter case, those powers may be exercised regardless of error. At least that is so unless, in the case of an appeal by way of rehearing, there is some statutory provision which indicates that the powers may be exercised whether or not there was error at first instance. And the critical distinction, for present purposes, between an appeal by way of rehearing and an appeal in the strict sense is that, unless the matter is remitted for rehearing, a court hearing an appeal in the strict sense can only give the decision which should have been given at first instance whereas, on an appeal by way of rehearing, an appellate court can substitute its own decision based on the facts and the law as they then stand. \\n\\n \\nAlthough this was a case concerning the Family Court, s 27 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) is not materially different to the equivalent provision of the Family Law Act 1976 (Cth): Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia Legeng [2001] HCA 17 at [75] , [2001] HCA 17 ; 205 CLR 507 at 533 per Gleeson CJ and Gummow J.

The hearing on that occasion took place in the absence of the Appellant and her then solicitor. Thereafter, on 22 December 2008 the Federal Magistrates Court, differently constituted, dismissed an application seeking an order under s 153B of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) that the bankruptcy be annulled: Revis v Murphy [2008] FMCA 1638.\\n\\nThese were considerations well known to the Federal Magistrate who made the sequestration order: [2008] FMCA 1561 at [6] . They are considerations expressly referred to in his reasons for decision. And that Magistrate's reasons for decision were expressly incorporated into the reasons for decision of the Federal Magistrate whose decision is now under appeal and who dismissed the application made pursuant to s 153B: [2008] FMCA 1638 at [14] .\\n\\nBut such assumptions do not lead to a conclusion that the sequestration order now ought to be annulled. As at September 2008 the Magistrate was unaware that the legal representative was not in attendance due to an error in his diary. Uninformed by that fact, the Magistrate proceeded as he did. He concluded that the debtor had \\\" had sufficient opportunity to appear today to oppose the petition if she wished to do so \\\": [2008] FMCA 1561 at [5] . As the true facts later unfolded, it is now apparent that the Appellant was not given this opportunity to be heard. But any denial of procedural fairness, it is considered, has not occasioned any prejudice to the Appellant because: she was given an opportunity in December 2008 to canvas the events that took place in April and September 2008 and to then advance whatever submissions she saw fit. Indeed, if there had been a denial of procedural fairness on that occasion, it may well have been suffered by the Respondent. The Respondent complains that in December 2008 the Federal Magistrate took into account an affidavit and further submissions filed by the now Appellant five days after the application had been heard; and the Appellant was again extended the opportunity as at the date of the hearing of the present appeal to advance whatever submissions she thought appropriate in respect to both the making of the order extending the life of the petition and the making of the sequestration order. \\nIn the absence of any reason to reach a contrary conclusion, it is thus considered that any denial of procedural fairness in the making of either the April or September 2008 decisions has occasioned the Appellant no prejudice and provides no basis for concluding that the sequestration order now ought to be annulled pursuant to s 153B.\\n\\nThe Appellant further contends that the present Respondent in pursuing bankruptcy proceedings has embarked upon an abuse of process.\",\"29\":\"But the power to dismiss an appeal for want of prosecution is a power available to be exercised in an appropriate case. \\\" [S]uccessive and cavalier omissions by the appellant \\\" led the Full Court to dismiss an appeal in NBCI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 280.

Left to one side when considering the merits of the present application to dismiss for want of prosecution have been such factors as the commencement by the present Appellant of a District Court proceeding. That proceeding was commenced subsequent to the service of the petition. Its procedural course was the subject of criticism by the Federal Magistrates Court. Such factors have been left to one side, as the \\\" want of prosecution \\\" to which O 52 r 38(1)(a) is directed is a want of prosecution of the \\\" appeal \\\"; defaults or procedural irregularities in other proceedings may appear to assume little (if any) immediate relevance when that provision is invoked.

Compliance ensures the orderly resolution of appeals and avoids the prospect of applications for adjournments or for orders seeking the dismissal of an appeal for failure to comply.

They may, however, extend to procedural issues: Maxwell-Smith v S & E Hill ; In the matter of Maxwell-Smith [2004] FCA 840 at [20] (Moore J). \\n\\n \\n [65] One basis upon which a creditor's petition may be dismissed is that the debtor has a cross claim against the creditor: Ling v Eurobrook (1997) 74 FCR 19 at 25. In St George Bank Ltd v Helfenbaum [1999] FCA 1337 , Sundberg J said (at 9): \\n\\n \\nThe existence of a cross-claim may be \\\"a sufficient cause\\\" within s 52(2)(b) for declining to make a sequestration order. It is for the debtor to establish the existence of \\\"sufficient cause\\\". He must establish that he has a real claim against the creditor that is likely to succeed. If the Court is satisfied that there is such a claim, and that its quantum is likely to equal or exceed the creditor's claim, it will not make a sequestration order. If the claim is likely to be less than the creditor's claim, the Court will require the debtor, if he is to avoid a sequestration order, to pay the difference between the judgment debt and the amount he is likely to recover on his claim. A debtor does not establish a real claim that is likely to succeed merely by producing a statement of claim in an action against a creditor ... or by pointing to the existence of current litigation against the creditor. While the Court does not try the cross-claim in advance, the debtor must adduce sufficient evidence to show that it is a real claim which is likely to succeed.\\n \\n \\n [66] A distinction has been drawn between a claim against the petitioner creditor which is likely to succeed and which would warrant refusal of a sequestration order and a \\\"real claim\\\" which has sufficient prospect to warrant the debtor being granted an opportunity to have it litigated. In the latter case an adjournment of the petition may be appropriate: In the matter of Jovanovic [1998] FCA 463 citing Re James, Ex parte Carter Holt Harvey Roofing (Australia) Pty Ltd (No 2) (1994) 51 FCR 14 at 22 (Olney J). The existence of a cross-claim against the petitioning creditor which is likely to succeed may support the proposition that the sequestration order ought not to have been made and should be annulled. On the other hand the existence of a real claim which might have warranted adjournment would not necessarily support that conclusion. That is not to exclude the possibility that in appropriate circumstances the registrar or judge hearing the petition ought to grant an adjournment on the basis of a \\\"real cross-claim\\\".\\n\\nA distinction is thus to be drawn between a claim which is likely to succeed and a \\\" real claim \\\" which may warrant an adjournment but not such as to necessarily warrant a conclusion that the sequestration order ought not to have been made. The Appellant did not contend that the District Court claim was one which could be characterised as a claim \\\" which is likely to succeed and which would warrant refusal of a sequestration order \\\". She did contend, however, that it remained a \\\" real claim \\\" \\u2014 the Federal Magistrate having characterised it as an \\\" arguable case \\\".\\n\\nIt is not considered that the claim \\u2014 however it may be characterised \\u2014 provided any basis upon which it could be concluded that the Federal Magistrate making the sequestration order was \\\" bound \\\" not to have made it.\\n\\nIt was not disputed that \\\" procedural issues \\\" may fall within s 153B: Rigg v Baker [2006] FCAFC 179 at [64] , [2006] FCAFC 179 ; 155 FCR 531 at 545. It may further be assumed for present purposes that, albeit inadvertently, the Appellant was denied procedural fairness in both April and September 2008. The denial of procedural fairness in September 2008 may provide a basis upon which it could be contended that the sequestration order ought not to have been made. Indeed the present case provides an instance of the ability in an application made pursuant to s 153B to consider all of the \\\" true facts \\\" as at the date of the making of the sequestration order: Heinrich v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2003] FCAFC 315 at [20] . The Federal Magistrate may not have known why neither the Appellant nor her solicitor was present on 2 September. But the Magistrate who heard the annulment application knew the reason; as does this Court. Even so, reservation may be expressed as to whether or not \\u2014 even in those circumstances \\u2014 it should be concluded that he was \\\" bound \\\" not to have made the sequestration order.\",\"35\":\"As to the first limb, it is to be noted that s 52(4) and (5) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) provide as follows: \\n (4) A creditor's petition lapses at the expiration of: \\n\\n(a) subject to paragraph (b), the period of 12 months commencing on the date of presentation of the petition; or \\n \\n(b) if the Court makes an order under subsection (5) in relation to the petition \\u2014 the period fixed by the order; \\n \\nunless, before the expiration of whichever of those periods is applicable, a sequestration order is made on the petition or the petition is dismissed or withdrawn. \\n \\n (5) The Court may, at any time before the expiration of the period of 12 months commencing on the date of presentation of a creditor's petition, if it considers it just and equitable to do so, upon such terms and conditions as it thinks fit, order that the period at the expiration of which the petition will lapse be such period, being a period exceeding 12 months and not exceeding 24 months, commencing on the date of presentation of the petition as is specified in the order. \\n\\n \\nOrder 35 r 7(3) of the Federal Court Rules provides as follows:\\n \\n A clerical mistake in a judgment or order, or an error arising in a judgment order from an accidental slip or omission, may at any time be corrected by the Court. \\n\\n \\n Rule 1.05 of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 (Cth), it may be noted, provides that the Federal Magistrates Court may apply the Federal Court Rules where, in a particular case, the 2001 Rules are \\\" insufficient or inappropriate \\\". By reason of the terms of Rule 1.05 of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules , no question arises as to a Federal Magistrate not being clothed with authority to invoke O 35 r 7: Roskell v Snelgrove [2008] FCA 427 at [37] to [41] [2008] FCA 427 ; , 246 ALR 175 at 181 to 182 per Lindgren J.\\n\\nSection 52(5), it has been observed, is in some ways comparable to the statutory requirement that a company be wound up within six months of an application being made. And in Elyard Corporation Pty Ltd v DDB Needham Sydney Pty Ltd (1995) 61 FCR 385 consideration was given to whether that statutory requirement displaced the \\\" slip rule \\\". That decision has since been applied in the context of bankruptcy proceedings in Griffiths v Boral Resources (Qld) Pty Ltd [2006] FCAFC 149 , 154 FCR 554. Spender ACJ, Dowsett and Collier JJ there observed as follows: \\n [29] The decision of the Full Court in Re Young; ex parte Smith (1985) 5 FCR 204 establishes that there can be no extension pursuant to s 52 of the Bankruptcy Act once the petition has lapsed. However the Court (of which Lockhart J was a member) considered that there was no question of applying the slip rule in that case (at 209). In Elyard the Court addressed the slip rule, but in the context of winding up rather than bankruptcy. Although s 52 of the Bankruptcy Act serves substantially the same purpose as s 459R of the Corporations Act , there are potentially significant differences between the two sections. \\n\\n \\n [30] With all respect, we are a little uncomfortable with the view, inherent in Elyard , that the slip rule may be used to extend time notwithstanding the statutory requirement that such order be made within a period of time which has elapsed. However Elyard concerns the practice of the Court and has now stood for over ten years without legislative intervention. We are reluctant to reconsider it. Although it does not directly bind us in applying s 52 of the Bankruptcy Act , to take a different approach would cause substantial confusion in insolvency practice. \\n\\n \\n [31] We wish to stress, however, the importance of the policy, evidenced in both the Corporations Act and the Bankruptcy Act , that insolvency proceedings be speedily resolved, presumably for commercial reasons and for reasons of fairness. Courts exercising jurisdiction in insolvency must recognise this policy by giving priority to the hearing and determination of such matters. The parties and their legal advisers, particularly those advising petitioning creditors, must be aware of the potential problem. The decision in Elyard should not be taken as establishing an unlimited power to avoid this statutory policy. \\n\\n \\n As also noted by their Honours, the question as to whether there was any \\\" error \\\" which attracted the power to invoke the \\\" slip rule \\\" is a question of fact: [2006] FCAFC 149 at [68] . With respect, the same reservation is also expressed as to ability to correct an \\\" error \\\" pursuant to O 35 r 7 by extending the duration of a petition in the face of the express statutory terms of s 52(5). Notwithstanding that reservation, it is the case that other authorities have endorsed the existence of a power to extend time after the initial 12 month period has expired and where there has been an accidental slip or omission in failing to make an application within the time prescribed by s 52(5): Matthews v Collett [2000] FCA 224 ; Bankstown Grammar School Ltd v Park [2000] FCA 1205 ; Roskell v Snelgrove [2008] FCA 427 , 246 ALR 175 ; Boumelhem v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2008] FCA 1568 , 171 FCR 462.\",\"36\":\"The section has essentially two elements, namely the establishment of the state of satisfaction that a sequestration order ought not to have been made and, if that state of satisfaction is reached, thereafter an exercise of discretion: Rigg v Baker [2006] FCAFC 179 at [59] , [2006] FCAFC 179 ; 155 FCR 531 at 543 per French J. Those who seek an annulment carry a \\\" heavy burden \\\": Re Papps; Ex parte Tapp (1997) 78 FCR 524 at 531 per O'Loughlin J; Evans v Hi-Fert Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 802 at [11] ; Samootin v Wagner [2008] FCA 1066 at [32] .\",\"37\":\"But the power to dismiss an appeal for want of prosecution is a power available to be exercised in an appropriate case. \\\" [S]uccessive and cavalier omissions by the appellant \\\" led the Full Court to dismiss an appeal in NBCI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 280. So, too, can \\\" persistent breach of the Court's directions \\\": Khera v Jones [2008] FCA 548 at [16] per Buchanan J. This power can be invoked in respect to all appeals, including bankruptcy appeals: e.g. Singh v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy [2008] FCA 544.\",\"38\":\"But the powers of the Court on appeal can only be exercised if there be appellable error. And, where an appeal is in the nature of a rehearing, the appellate Court can substitute its own decision on the facts and law as they then stand: Allesch v Maunz [2000] HCA 40 at [23] , [2000] HCA 40 ; 203 CLR 172 at 180 to 181. Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ there made the following observations in relation to the powers of a Court when entertaining an appeal by way of a rehearing (references omitted): \\n For present purposes, the critical difference between an appeal by way of rehearing and a hearing de novo is that, in the former case, the powers of the appellate court are exercisable only where the appellant can demonstrate that, having regard to all the evidence now before the appellate court, the order that is the subject of the appeal is the result of some legal, factual or discretionary error, whereas, in the latter case, those powers may be exercised regardless of error. At least that is so unless, in the case of an appeal by way of rehearing, there is some statutory provision which indicates that the powers may be exercised whether or not there was error at first instance. And the critical distinction, for present purposes, between an appeal by way of rehearing and an appeal in the strict sense is that, unless the matter is remitted for rehearing, a court hearing an appeal in the strict sense can only give the decision which should have been given at first instance whereas, on an appeal by way of rehearing, an appellate court can substitute its own decision based on the facts and the law as they then stand. \\n\\n \\nAlthough this was a case concerning the Family Court, s 27 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) is not materially different to the equivalent provision of the Family Law Act 1976 (Cth): Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia Legeng [2001] HCA 17 at [75] , [2001] HCA 17 ; 205 CLR 507 at 533 per Gleeson CJ and Gummow J. The \\\" proper role of an appellate court under s 25 of the Federal Court Act ... is ordinarily to correct error \\\": Sobey v Nicol [2007] FCAFC 136 at [72] , [2007] FCAFC 136 ; 245 ALR 389 at 403 to 404 per Branson, Lindgren and Besanko JJ. It is not appropriate to treat an appeal \\\"as though it were a new trial on the evidence and constrained merely by ... unassailable factual findings \\\"; error must be demonstrated: Branir Pty Ltd v Owston Nominees (No 2) Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1833 at [30] , [2001] FCA 1833 ; 117 FCR 424 at 438 per Allsop J (Drummond and Mansfield JJ agreeing).\",\"39\":\"There was no dissent from the proposition that the Court has an implied jurisdiction to set aside a bankruptcy notice as an abuse of process: Re Sterling; Ex parte Esanda Ltd [1980] FCA 61 ; (1980) 44 FLR 125. And an abuse of process may be made out if the purpose in issuing the bankruptcy notice is to put pressure on a debtor to pay the debt rather than to invoke the Court's jurisdiction in relation to insolvency: Brunninghausen v Glavanics [1998] FCA 230. In Killoran v Duncan [1999] FCA 1574 , Gyles J thus observed: \\n [12] Whilst there is no debate about the jurisdiction of the Court to set aside a bankruptcy notice as an abuse of process where it can be concluded that it was simply to put pressure on the debtor rather than to genuinely invoke the Court's jurisdiction, I am not satisfied that that is the position here. There is nothing to indicate that the respondent creditor does not genuinely intend to pursue the matter if there is default in complying with the notice. In my opinion, there is nothing special about abuse of process in this field, and, if a person wishes to resort to the jurisdiction of the Court for appropriate orders, then it will be an unusual case in which that will be prevented. \\n\\n \\n [13] There is no evidence here of any collateral purpose or of any undue pressure being applied. It is correct, I think, that the time to judge abuse of process is the time that the bankruptcy notice is issued and that subsequent events have relatively slight relevance. They may be relevant insofar as they throw light upon circumstances which might have been appreciated and foreseen at the time of the issue of the notice. \\n\\n \\n [14] If, contrary to my view, however, there were a prima facie case of abuse of process, the remedy is discretionary and, in my view, if circumstances following that time had altered significantly so that it would not be appropriate to set aside the notice, I think that the jurisdiction of the Court is wide enough to give effect to that. I have in mind here that whilst the immediate parties to the application are those with the most interest in the matter, the body of creditors generally also have an interest and I cannot be certain one way or the other about the position of solvency. It may be most unfortunate if a bankruptcy notice were set aside in circumstances where the debtor is in fact insolvent. \\n\\n \\nBy way of example, in Maxwell-Smith v S & E Hall Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 825 , 233 ALR 81 Jacobson J was prepared to infer that the purpose in issuing a bankruptcy notice was to put pressure on the debtor rather than to genuinely invoke the court's bankruptcy jurisdiction in circumstances where the bankruptcy notice sought payment of a debt for a small amount based on a judgment debt which was over 5 years old; where the judgment creditor was aware of the probability of solvency; and where the judgment debtor owned assets which greatly exceeded the debt.

It is an abuse of process for a judgment creditor to pursue bankruptcy proceedings \\\" for the purpose of stifling litigation \\\": Bayne v Baillieu; Bayne v Riggall [1908] HCA 39 ; (1908) 6 CLR 382 at 396 per Griffith CJ.\",\"40\":\"The reasons for decision of the Federal Magistrate who made the sequestration order in September 2008 referred to the Statement of Claim and relevantly concluded: \\n [6] ... It is pleaded with some detail, but its merits and prospects of success are not immediately apparent, and there is no sufficient evidence before me that there would be \\\"other sufficient cause\\\" for the Court to decline in its discretion to make a sequestration order, pursuant to principles such as were discussed by Allsop J in Totev v Sfar [2006] FCA 470. I am not satisfied that the debtor has shown that she has a claim against the applicant exceeding the amount of the debt relied on in the petition, which is \\\"likely to succeed\\\" and is being pursued with sufficient expedition. \\n\\n \\nThe decision of the Federal Magistrate whose decision is now under appeal referred to the earlier September 2008 decision and concluded:\\n \\n [15] There has been no appeal to the Federal Court from his Honour's judgment. In my view, it is an inappropriate course for a bankrupt to seek, by annulment application, to achieve what she is unwilling or unable to achieve through an appeal, namely the reconsideration of the reasons of this Court for the making of the sequestration order. In any event, I accept from the evidence of Mr Steel that those District Court proceedings appear to be a defensive action in order to avoid dealing with the bills of costs rendered by Ms Murphy for the family law proceedings. The trustee has been unable to form a view as to the prospects of success of the claim in the District Court as he has not been funded to pursue or inquire into them. Those proceedings are presently stayed by the bankruptcy. \\n\\n \\nThe Magistrate then went on to give an account of the proceeding in the Family Court and concluded as follows:\\n \\n [17] ... Her case against Ms Murphy centres on the proposition that the conduct of Ms Murphy prevented her from accepting that offer. That is one possible characterisation. Another is that there was an offer on the table for higher than what Ms Murphy had advised Ms Revis she could expect to get on a judgment, but Ms Revis had unrealistic expectations and Ms Murphy pursued the matter as best she could in accordance with her instructions. I accept, based upon the available material, that Ms Revis has an arguable case of professional negligence in the District Court, but that does not alter my conclusions about the motivation for those proceedings and the manner in which they have been conducted. \\n\\n \\n ... \\n\\n \\n [20] Further, Ms Revis has failed to satisfy me that she is solvent. ... \\n\\n \\n [21] I do not accept that the sequestration order made by this Court should not have been made. It is unnecessary to consider the factors relevant to an exercise of the Court's discretion but, in general terms, the interests of creditors would be best served by the orderly administration of Ms Revis' affairs in the bankruptcy and the realisation of her interest in the house property before that equity is further dissipated. \\n\\n \\nClearly, the Federal Magistrate was not satisfied that the sequestration order ought not to have been made and, had the occasion arisen for the exercise of the discretion conferred by s 153B, he would have exercised that discretion adversely to the now Appellant. He reasoned that:\\n it was not appropriate to employ the mechanism provided for by s 153B to contest the orders made in September 2008; and \\\" [i]n any event \\\", the \\\" motivation \\\" for the District Court proceeding was \\\" to avoid dealing with the bills of costs rendered by Ms Murphy for the family law proceedings \\\". \\nNotwithstanding the submission of the Respondent that it was the failure to satisfy the Federal Magistrate as to solvency which formed the basis of the Federal Magistrate's decision, it is considered that paragraph [15] was either the principal basis upon which the Magistrate proceeded or a very significant reason for his decision to dismiss the application being advanced.\\n\\nIn so proceeding, it is respectfully considered that the Federal Magistrate erred.\\n\\nCentrally relevant to whether a sequestration order may be made are the financial circumstances of the debtor. Section 52(2) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) thus provides as follows: \\n If the Court is not satisfied with the proof of any of those matters, or is satisfied by the debtor: \\n (a) that he or she is able to pay his or her debts; or \\n (b) that for other sufficient cause a sequestration order ought not to be made; \\n it may dismiss the petition. \\n\\n \\n\\\" Other sufficient cause \\\" may include a claim sounding in money by the debtor against a petitioning creditor: Totev v Sfar [2006] FCA 470 , 230 ALR 236.\",\"41\":\"The power conferred by O 52 r 38(1)(a) \\\" must not be lightly exercised \\\": Van Reesema v Giameos [1979] FCA 108 ; (1979) 41 FLR 86 at 90 per Bowen CJ, Fisher and Lockhart JJ; Goldie v The Commonwealth of Australia [2004] FCA 973 at [16] per Carr J. It has further been recognised that the Court's power \\\" to dismiss for want of prosecution is a drastic step which would only be justified by the grossest or most contumelious delay \\\": Hughes v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2004] FCA 1271 at [8] per Jacobson J. It is \\\" exceptional for the court to dismiss a matter for want of prosecution under O 52 r 38(1)(a) \\\": Abraham v Attorney-General for the Commonwealth [2004] FCA 411 at [5] per Finn J.\",\"42\":\"The manner in which s 153B is to be applied has been summarised as follows by Carr, Finn and Sundberg JJ in Heinrich v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2003] FCAFC 315: \\n [20] The Court must first consider whether the sequestration order ought not to have been made. If it so finds, then the Court must consider whether, in the exercise of its discretion, the bankruptcy should be annulled: Re Deriu (1970) 16 FLR 420. Later evidence of previously unknown facts may disclose matters which show that the sequestration order ought not to have been made. That is, the Court is entitled to consider not only the case as disclosed at the time when the sequestration order was made, but also those facts now known then to have existed. The Court excludes those facts which have occurred since the order was made. Later evidence of previously unknown facts may disclose matters which show that the sequestration order ought not to have been made: Re Frank; Ex parte Piliszky (1987) 16 FCR 396 ; Stankiewicz v Plata [2000] FCA 1185 at [19] ; Re Williams (1968) 13 FLR 10 at 23; Re Ditfort; Ex parte Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 19 FCR 347.

The only evidence as to the current financial circumstances of the Appellant was contained in the Trustee's affidavit prepared for the purposes of the December 2008 proceedings in the Federal Magistrates Court. He there stated: \\n[44] ... it is my opinion that the Bankrupt was insolvent at the date of Bankruptcy and at the time of swearing this Affidavit.\\n \\n \\nThere was no more current evidence.\\n the absence of any full and frank disclosure by the Appellant of her financial affairs as at the date of the hearing of her appeal; and the voluntary non-appearance and want of opposition to the creditor's petition at the outset of the bankruptcy process. \\nAn additional factor may also be relied upon, namely: \\n the failure of the Appellant to promptly prosecute the present appeal, albeit not being a delay warranting dismissal of the appeal.\"}}"
