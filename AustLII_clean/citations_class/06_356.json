"{\"id\":{\"0\":\"c0\"},\"class\":{\"0\":\"referred to\"},\"tocase\":{\"0\":\"Tempo Services Limited (2005) 53 ACSR 523\"},\"text\":{\"0\":\"9 One of the matters raised by Mr Oakes' submission is what I can call the \\\"credit risk issue\\\" which arises from the necessary lead time before the payment of the cash consideration. I am satisfied that the scheme adopts a version of the model which was approved by Gyles J in Re Tempo Services Limited (2005) 53 ACSR 523. I note also that the evidence includes a letter from the Washington Post Company dated 10 March 2006 in which that company unconditionally undertakes to Kaplan to provide Kaplan with the scheme consideration.\\n\\n10 One other matter which I raised with Mr Oakes is that the scheme provides for a takeover of the scheme company which could have proceeded under the provisions of Chapter 6 of the Act .\\n\\n11 In Ford's Principles of Corporations Law at [24.060] the authors set out the authorities which have considered this question. The authors conclude that the effect of the cases is to preserve the availability of the Scheme of Arrangement procedure to achieve a friendly takeover offer notwithstanding s 411(17) as long as the scheme includes essential elements which could not be achieved under Chapter 6.\"}}"
