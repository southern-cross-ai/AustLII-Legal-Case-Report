For present purposes, the essential criterion for entitlement to the business visa is that set out in cl 845.215 of the Migration Regulations 1994 (Cth) ('the Regulations'), which provides:\\n \\n The total value of the net assets owned by the applicant, or by the applicant and the applicant's spouse together, in the main business or main businesses in Australia: \\n (a) is; and \\n \\n \\n (b) has been throughout the period of 12 months immediately preceding the making of the application; \\n \\n \\n at least AUD100,000.\\n\\n5 On the basis of the application for a business visa, the appellant nominated Quincy Development Pty Limited ('Quincy'), as the main business.\\n\\n6 The Tribunal was satisfied that Quincy was a main business, and the first appellant had an \\\"ownership interest\\\" in Quincy. However the Tribunal found that the first appellant did not satisfy the criterion in cl 845.215. In applying the criterion in cl 845.215 the Tribunal identified the relevant period as being from 27 February 2002 to 27 February 2003, this being the \\\"period of 12 months immediately preceding the making of the application\\\".\"}}"
