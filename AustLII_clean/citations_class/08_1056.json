That discretion is not to be fettered by transformation of approaches and practices developed through the cases into quasi statutory rules. In John S Hayes & Associates Pty Ltd v Kimberly-Clark Australia Pty Ltd (1994) 52 FCR 201 , Hill J said (at 203): \\n care must be taken not to circumscribe the discretion by reference to closed categories.

Finn J referred to authorities on the point in GEC Marconi Systems Pty Ltd v BHP Information Technology Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 688 ; (2003) 201 ALR 55 at [34] . His Honour cited single judge decisions to the effect that such offers ought not to be a relevant consideration on the question of costs and would not be considered in the same way as a Calderbank letter. His Honour was invited to depart from that line of first instance authority. However he was not prepared to say it was clearly wrong. Notwithstanding that, in the circumstances of the case he had to decide, his Honour found that: \\n The fact that the offer gave no indication at all of the breakdown ... between the claim, interest and costs blunts significantly the weight to be given the offer.\\n\\n35 While respecting the general approach to rolled up offers reflected in the cases to which Finn J referred, such approaches cannot be calcified into rules of law which fetter a general discretion. They simply reflect a common sense proposition that generally speaking such an offer is not unreasonably refused. There may, however, be circumstances where a rolled up offer, refused by an applicant who is unsuccessful, may support a claim for indemnity costs.\",\"6\":\"33 The preceding general principles inform the exercise of the discretion.

Given the evaluative character of the judgment involved the addition of the word \\\"plainly\\\" which is itself evaluative, has no useful function.\\n\\n37 At the time that Sirtex made its offer to UWA the prospect of UWA succeeding against Sirtex depended critically upon: \\n \\n1. UWA establishing its case against Dr Gray and, in particular, that he had breached his fiduciary duty. \\n \\n2. UWA establishing that Sirtex was accessorially liable in relation to that breach, a position that depended upon establishing that Sirtex was aware of facts constituting (and which would have indicated to a reasonable person) the breach of fiduciary duties owed by Dr Gray to UWA.\\n\\n38 It cannot be said that UWA acted unreasonably in proceeding on the basis that it had a reasonable cause of action against Dr Gray. True it is that the case as framed and presented depended upon an important proposition of law as to the existence of an implied term in the contract of Dr Gray's employment with UWA. But the correctness of that proposition had not previously been tested in Australia in circumstances of the kind which arose in this case. This is not a case, in my opinion, in which it is appropriate to take a hindsight test to the facts known to UWA at the time of Sirtex's offer and conclude that it ought to have known that the law was against it.\\n\\n39 There were of course other hazards in the way of UWA's path to success against Dr Gray and therefore against Sirtex. The question whether the relevant inventions were made while Dr Gray was an employee of UWA was one issue upon which findings adverse to UWA were made on all but the DOX-Spheres technology. There was also a finding adverse to UWA that none of the Sirtex directors, apart from Dr Gray, were on notice of a potential claim. To establish any cause of action against Sirtex based on knowing involvement in his alleged breaches of fiduciary duty would have depended entirely upon his role as a director of Sirtex and whether his knowledge could be attributed to that company. In addition, UWA faced substantial defences by Sirtex based on UWA's delay in commencing proceedings after it first became aware of the facts relevant to its claimed causes of action.\\n\\n40 The preceding factors may be seen as weighing to some degree in favour of the Sirtex motion. On the other hand the offer came as the trial commenced. That is a factor, given the focus on the trial process which would then have existed, that militates against a finding of unreasonableness on the part of UWA in refusing the offer. That conclusion is not affected by the fact that Sirtex was making a counter-offer. The counter-offer was not a variation on a theme opened by UWA's offers. It was quite different and could have been proposed earlier.\"}}"
