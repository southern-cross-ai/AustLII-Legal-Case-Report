The second respondent, the Bombala Council, requested at the time I published my judgment that I vacate my proposed order as to costs as it wished to seek indemnity costs in the matter.\",\"1\":\"The Council puts its claim for indemnity costs on two bases. The first relies upon the discretion the Court has to depart from the usual principles informing the judicial discretion to award costs where the circumstances of the case warrant such a departure: see Re Wilcox: Ex parte Venture Industries Pty Ltd (1996) 141 ALR 727 at 732-734. The second relies upon an offer of compromise being made under O 23 r 11 of the Federal Court Rules , it being contended that, the application having been dismissed summarily, Mr Wilkshire obtained a result less favourable than the terms of the offer of compromise dated 4 June 2009 which was made to him. I can deal with the second of these grounds shortly.\\n\\nIn my view there is reason for a court to be slow to allow indemnity costs to be obtained under O 23 r 11 in circumstances in which the relevant order obtained (against which the Order 23 r 11 comparison is to be made) is an order for summary dismissal. I do not consider it to be a policy of O 23 to provide a successful party as of course with the forensic advantage of indemnity costs when involved in proceedings with another whose case is hopeless and doomed to failure. For my own part I would be reluctant to order indemnity costs pursuant to O 23 r 11 on a motion for summary dismissal unless an award of indemnity costs is itself warranted by the principles informing the judicial discretion to award such costs. It is unnecessary for present purposes to enlarge upon those principles. Some number of them were expounded by Sheppard J in Colgate-Palmolive Co v Cussons Pty Ltd [1993] FCA 536 ; (1993) 46 FCR 225 at 232-233; see also Re Wilcox ; and see generally Dal Pont, Law of Costs [16.39] ff (2 nd ed, 2009).\",\"2\":\"In my view there is reason for a court to be slow to allow indemnity costs to be obtained under O 23 r 11 in circumstances in which the relevant order obtained (against which the Order 23 r 11 comparison is to be made) is an order for summary dismissal.
