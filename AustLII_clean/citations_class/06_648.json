The issue is the question of whether section 424A was breached. The Minister concedes that in light of a decision of a Full Court in SZEEU v Minister for Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 2 (\\\" SZEEU\\\") , the Federal Magistrate's finding that a protection visa application had been adopted in writing was no longer sustainable the Minister concedes that the information contained in the appellant's protection visa application was not \\\"information\\\" falling within the exception contained in section 424A(3)(b) of the Act .\\n\\n33 However, it seems to me to be clear that the observations of Allsop J in SZEEU at [206] and [207] are applicable. That is to say, \\\"information\\\" does not encompass the RRT's subjective appraisals, thought processes or determinations nor does it encompass gaps, defects or lack of detail or specificity in evidence or to conclusions arrived at by the RRT in weighing the evidence by reference to those gaps.\\n\\n34 Thus, applying the approach adopted by Allsop J at [216] of SZEEU, the RRTs reasons in the present case went to the appellant's manner of giving evidence and the vague and generalised claims which he made it was those factors which informed the RRTs decision and not the information in the protection visa application itself.\\n\\n35 I am satisfied on a careful reading of the decision of the RRT and the decision of the Federal Magistrate that there is no fairly arguable case that the appellant could succeed on an appeal. I therefore decline to exercise my discretion to set aside the orders which I made on 11 April 2006.\\n\\n36 The order I will make is that the notice of motion be dismissed with costs.\\n \\n\\n\\n I certify that the preceding thirty six (36) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Jacobson. \\n\\nAssociate:\\n\\nDated: 31 May 2006\\n\\n\\n \\n The Appellant appeared in person \\n \\n Solicitor for the Respondent: Sparke Helmore \\n \\n Date of Hearing: 24 May 2006 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 24 May 2006 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http:\\/\\/www.austlii.edu.au\\/au\\/cases\\/cth\\/FCA\\/2006\\/648.html\"}}"
