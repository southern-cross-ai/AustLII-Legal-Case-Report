The High Court has stressed that the reasonableness of any complaint of apprehended bias is \\\"to be considered in the context of ordinary judicial practice\\\": Johnson at 493. Thus, events occurring within the ordinary course of litigation will not give rise to an apprehension of bias. As the High Court has explained, \\\"modern judges, responding to a need for more active case management, intervene in the conduct of cases to an extent that may surprise a person who came to court expecting a judge to remain, until the moment of pronouncement of judgment, as inscrutable as the Sphinx\\\": Johnson at 493. As a case progresses, a judge may make rulings, as needs be, on adjournment applications, the admissibility of evidence, the amendment of pleadings and the like but the fact that the ruling may suit the immediate interests of one side rather than the other does not mean that the judge has formed any concluded view about the ultimate merits of the case. From time to time, a judge may also indicate to counsel that she or he is taking some necessarily tentative view on an issue. The reason for this is most often to allow counsel an opportunity to deal with the problem that the judge perceives, whether rightly or wrongly, to lie in counsel's way.\",\"2\":\"10 As the High Court's judgment in Antoun v The Queen [2006] HCA 2 indicates, there remain limits on the manner in which a judge may conduct a case even allowing for modern case management practices. In the present case, however, the applicant has identified what are for the most part rulings that are commonplace in many trials.\\n\\n11 Mr Spalla first raised the issue of my decision to continue with the hearing despite the illness of his senior counsel. As the respondents noted, this was a qualified decision. After a colloquy with the applicant's junior counsel (who has apparently over ten year's experience at the bar) I ruled that the hearing should continue in order that the applicant might present his evidence in chief notwithstanding the absence of senior counsel. The applicant's counsel apparently conceded that he could cope with the presentation of evidence in chief although not cross-examination. I ruled that I would adjourn the hearing, if needs be, to allow the applicant the benefit of senior counsel in the cross-examination of the respondents' witnesses. A date was nominated, which was available to the Court, and, on the information before me at that time, gave the applicant a sufficient opportunity to order his affairs. The respondents opposed any adjournment. My decision favoured neither party. It was a straightforward example of case management, which took account of the interests of all parties, as well as broader interests in the timely progression of cases in order that other litigants might also be heard. Decisions such as these are routine and are not proper bases for disqualifying the trial judge.\\n\\n12 Similar considerations apply to Mr Spalla's complaints about my rulings concerning the admissibility of his affidavit of 1 June 2005 and his application for leave to amend further his notice of motion. The rulings have not been as Mr Spalla wanted.\"}}"
