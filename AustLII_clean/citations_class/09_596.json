Particulars of the information and the reason why it may be relevant were given to the appellant in accordance with s 424A(1)(b).\\n\\nThe fact that the information may have been provided in the first instance by the appellant to the tour operator was of no dispositive relevance and was not required to be supplied to the appellant.\\n\\nTo the extent that it is permissible to refer to the Tribunal's reasons to determine whether the Tribunal considered the source of the information to be a reason for affirming the decision, the reasons of the Tribunal, in particular at [87], support the conclusion I have reached.\",\"1\":\"The proper construction of s 424A(1) was referred to by the High Court in SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 ; (2007) 235 ALR 609 at [17] ff and by a Full Court in SZKLG v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCAFC 198 ; (2007) 164 FCR 578 at [33] .

But whether one looks at the transcript of the hearing, or the Tribunal's reasons, it is plain, in my opinion, that the approach taken by the Federal Magistrate was correct.\\n\\nAs his Honour said at [20], the information which the Tribunal considered would be a reason for affirming the decision was that a report had been received which indicated that there was a motive for the appellant wishing to come to Australia different from that which formed the basis of his application for a protection visa, and the existence of that report cast doubt upon the credibility of the appellant.\\n\\nThis is clear from what the Tribunal put to the appellant during the oral hearing as revealed in the passage from the transcript set out above.\\n\\nMoreover, as the Federal Magistrate went on to say at [20], the existence of the report and the reason why it may be relevant to the decision making process was clearly explained in the s 424A letter.\\n\\nIn my opinion, this approach is inconsistent with the proper construction of \\n s 424A(1)(a) and the authorities which have construed it. In my view, the effect of what the High Court said in SZBYR at [17], and, in particular, of what the Full Court said in SZKLG at [33] is that the word \\\"considers\\\" in s 424(1)(a) is directed at the subjective consideration of the Tribunal on the facts of each case.\",\"2\":\"The proper construction of s 424A(1) was referred to by the High Court in SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 ; (2007) 235 ALR 609 at [17] ff and by a Full Court in SZKLG v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCAFC 198 ; (2007) 164 FCR 578 at [33] .

In SZMPT at [16] [18], I expressed the view that the Tribunal's reasons are not the starting point, but that it may be appropriate to refer to them to determine whether the Tribunal considered the information to be a reason for affirming the decision under review.\"}}"
